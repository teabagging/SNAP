I didn't know she was in this until she first appeared in the film. The movie has a fun little story. I won't give anything away but one point I love about it is the movie does not explain why city of ember exists and very little backstory at all. I like that it's a mystery and you have to use your imagination. There is also a little jab at politics in general which is nice too.

If you want to watch this movie because you enjoyed the book, don't waste your time. She hated it and criticized nearly every scene. They are faithful to many of the minor details in the book such as the characters names and the cities location and the fact that there is a box with directions on how to get out of the city. Otherwise the rest came right out of the directors head; I honestly could not tell if he had even read the book when he made the movie. I highly recommend avoiding this movie at all costs, it really is that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After seeing Saoirse Ronan's performance in Atonement, I was disappointed to see how shallow her acting can be.

This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, it's a granule. It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless. My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake. It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive. I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Flavor","review":"I bought this same brand from an online Indian grocery store that usually has excellent products. I was able to turn it into cream/butter, using my super blender and adding some water, but it barely had any flavor.

My complaint is not the shreds or texture. Mine was just virtually tasteless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be sturdier","review":"For the first few weeks this headset was fine for morning workouts. Good sound, comfortable fit, relatively easy to use. I've had it about six months and the flaws in the design are becoming evident and annoying. The little metal parts like the screws have corroded, the set gets stuck on a single channel -- not the one I want -- and it's impossible to change, it goes through batteries way too quickly, and sometimes it just doesn't work. The channel settings are lost when you change batteries, so I stopped using that feature after the second battery swap-out. The low-battery indicator light always seems to be on no matter how fresh the batteries are. As new as my unit is, I feel like it's on its last legs. This said, if the company came out with a much better version of the same product I would buy it because the basic concept is strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great unit until it broke.","review":"I bought this GPX unit looking for a ..., digital radio to use while jogging.

I still use it on FM stations, but I wish I had spent a few extra dollars and bought the Koss headphone radio. I had a Koss model that lasted for 5+ years through all sorts of abuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Chevillard's best, but close","review":"I enjoyed this novel very much, but it was bound to pale next to Chevillard's Crab Nebula.

But, to tell the truth I was really disappointed and I love Rania's dvd's. I figured it would be better. I didn't get much out of it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice combinations","review":"This DVD has a nice workout that's fairly easy to follow. I did miss the routine at the end, in which Rania puts together the combinations you learn. I'm not sure why that wasn't on here. But the combinations were nice because you could do them individually without having to do the others. The warm-up, for me, seemed more aptly called a workout. There really wasn't any warming up. Rania just has you jump right in. I think a slower paced warm-up would help get people prepared for the workout. You really have to pay attention to that as an instructor because beginners especially may not know what constitutes a proper and safe warm-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bundt Pans","review":"This is a very useful book if you are looking for recipes to use with your bundt pan. The book contains a wide variety of recipes from desserts to \\"salads\\" (what Midwestern-ers call desserts) to entrees to regular salads, including pound cakes, fruitcakes, breads, cakes from mixes, coffee cakes, ice cream molds, cakes, and more. This book contains vintage recipes that, depending on where you are from, you probably grew up with or at least your family did years ago. These recipes are great for special occasions. Some of the recipes are Double Chocolate Fudge Cake, Grasshopper Cake, Harvey Wallbanger Cake, Southern Sally Lunn, Easy Italian Ring, Red-White-and-Blue Mold (gelatin), Swiss Cheese Bread, Lemon-Cheese Filled Cake, Sour Cream Coffee Cake, Pistachio Cake Supreme, Butterscotch Rum Ripple Cake, the famous Tunnel of Fudge Cake, and more.

The books themselves were terrific, but having the opportunity to have them read to you in such a dynamic, masterful way has made the story leap off the pages and place the reader in the middle of the action.

But overall, I'm impressed with what I hear, and I would like to get the rest of the books in Dramatic Audio format to get the full story from beginning to end.(By the way, I overlaid a section of Mercy Me's \\"I Can Only Imagine\\" on the part where Jesus calls Rayford to meet Him.

These victims did not authorize their pictures to be published and I would bet neither did their families. Although, that may not legally stop this author, it should have morally halted the publishing of this book. I agree with a review above that this is the equivalent (or worse) of rubbernecking to see mangled bodies in a car accident.

These people had lives, family, and friends. What gives anyone the right?

As for me, I was barely able to look through it once without feeling sick-to-my stomach.

This is an excellent series of hard drive enclosures and after hours of researching what external enclosure I should buy I settled on this one. I purchased a model in the same series (the USB2.0/eSATA one, exact same design as this, but with different connections) partly because I liked the looks of it, i.e. it doesn't say something stupid on the side of it like \\"HARD DRIVE BOX\\" in huge block lettering like so many cases do. I also purchased it because of over 300 FIVE STAR RATINGS this exact model got at newegg.com, and over 200 5 star ratings for others in the series. The one negative reviewer here is alone on his stance."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing drive enclosure, I will buy nothing else","review":"It isn't cheap, but it's worth it. This is the highest quality enclosure I've found, and I've tried dozens of them through the years. It's very quiet, keeps drives much cooler than other cases, and feels solid. I heartily recommend this case to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Designed","review":"The engineer who designed the air flow physics of this thing should be fired.It has a standard large fan located under the hard drive you install in it. In comparison to most other enclosures, instead of blowing air on your drive to keep it cool, the fan rotates in reverse, allowing the hard drive to heat up, and then attempts to pull the heat away through ineffectively small exhaust vents on the sides.The end result is that this enclosure TRAPS most of the heat, causing both your hard drive and the enclosure to get hotter and hotter. If you want to cook your hard drive and shorten it's life in this thing, well, it's a free country.Be intelligent. Shop further for a better product.I recommend the Thermaltake N0012USU Max 4 Active Cooling 3.5-Inch USB 2.0 eSATA Hard Drive Enclosure. Amazon currently sells this."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh.","review":"i like all three songs. it's an okay single, i guess, but it seemed like zwan half-*ssed this single by not bothering to include studio tracks. both of the b-sides are live recordings from the hideout shows.....it just would have been nice for them to put a little more effort into a single, and give the fans something we didn't already have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Shit","review":"This dude is the next nigga out of houston.

I had recently upgraded to the Canon Rebel digital only to find that the lens included in my package did not hold a candle to my old ones. Locking the adapter to the lens was a mess. The minute I removed it from the box I realized how delicate (cheap) the product was. I managed to get about 10 shots with my old macro when in an attempt to focus the lens...pop...right off again. While trying to reattach the product to the lens it simply fell apart. I paid $40 for about 30 minutes of lens use. For the record...I am a 5'2 female, 100 lbs and not someone who is overly rough by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"First off, the item is not made by Canon despite ad claim. Its corrective lens is poor quality and NOT coated such that the images captured by your high quality FD lens are mediocre at best. So why try to use a great lens and have its image messed up by a lousy corrective lens? Now I have a gadget that I will never use and an unresolved problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is perfect for people who have a nice FD lens that they want to use on the new EF body on the DSLR. It saves you a lot of money. Instead of spending $300+ dollars on a new 300mm lens, but this adapter. It's perfect. It doesn't come with instructions, but you don't need them. Just match up the red dot with the red dot on the camera, just like a lens. Then do the same to attach the FD lens to the other side. It's that easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine","review":"Good optical instrument for attaching FD lenses to EOS EF cameras.However:Comes with NO instructions: which way does it go? It is theortically possible to jam lenses and accessories together so they can never be separated. I do not know if this would happen with this, but a simple diagram at least wouold help!Really cheesy, cheap, generic end caps.Cheap generic box.Since the caps fall right off, a good box would help keep it together. I may have to buy good caps to protect it.All in all a good product but for $100 bucks for a metal ring with a lens they did not need to scrimp like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"I bought this so I can use my other lens on my digital camera.

I've had to put it under my bed every night, but I can still see the glow. I've tried to dim it, but that's as dark as it gets. The radio is horrible, although you can program multiple channels, the reception is so aweful that they barely work. And when the radio is on, the display turns to the station number, and you can't set it to show the time. Also, it's difficult to see the display unless you're right in front of it, even though it's bright.

It took some good ideas (the Jack story is embedded in a modern-day tale of babysitting for a bratty little kid, some potentially charming embellishments on the fairy tale itself), but the writing (this thing must have been churned out in a week or two) didn't do anything with them. The songwriting and choreography are similarly uninspired.The other thing that wasn't there was quality acting/directing (for example, the giant spends most of his time standing around looking threatening).My sons (4 and 5) are big movie fans, and will sit and watch almost anything - they lost interest in this within a few minutes.

They spend time together on earth before Jared's mentor, who wipes the memory of their meeting from their minds, takes him back. Years later they meet again and thus ensues a romance and adventure.I thought this science fiction romance had a beautiful love story. We actually see more of Jared's character as a great deal of the book is from his viewpoint. I agree with one of the reviewers that this book does not really take off until the middle and once it does, it throws a completely new spin on the action. It took me quite by surprise after the first of the book deals mainly with their growing relationship. There were some very touching scenes that made me cry. The love scenes were beautiful.

But I just couldn't get into this one. There is nothing specifically wrong with the writing, just wasn't interesting. The characters were flat and not worth the effort. The plot also didn't seemed to be going anywhere anytime soon. The closest I can come in the way of an explanation would be that the author is basically painting by the numbers, all the right elements are there but there's no spark. The book is nothing spectacular, but also not terribly bad either.

I swear this is the first time I haven't had a HUGE callus on the back of my heel. It is absolutely perfect. The scrubber hadn't come in yet, so i used ones we already had, and it worked. I think the recommended one will be better though. Its like having new feet! I totally think if you are searching for a callus remover, this is the product for you. I also watched the you tube video in spanish with subtitles. Pretty simple to use. I did a couple of times in one hour, since I freaked out over someone else comment about burning yourself. I didn't have any problem with it. no irritation or anything! a must have!!! Also it shipped super fast. It got to me in Japan in less than a week!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great ...","review":"I did not find this product very helpful. I was careful to follow the instructions exactly as provided, but for me simply using file or egg shaped file and then using their heal lotion to be much more effective if used on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a supplment not a solution","review":"So I've tried this twice over the past two days and even after using this product as the instructions on the bottle indicated, I had to do a GREAT deal of buffing with a foot file.. just as much as I would had I not used this product.. not too impressed.. this maybe helps a little, with dry heels, but it doesn't do much for actual calluses on the balls of ones feet from wearing heels. NOT impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful with this one!","review":"I purchased this to remove callouses from my feet. It sure did,but be careful. Even wearing gloves my hands became itchy and red. In a week my fingernails became weakened and peeled. This product did its job and more for me. I'd recommend using it in a salon...NOT at home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent if you have bad heels and calluses","review":"Great product but watch the time you leave the product on your feet or you will get burned.

It is not a miracle in fact it didn't burn my non callus parts!! Think of Elmer's glue when it dries how you can peel it. That is what this product basically is.

Be natural should be called beripoff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BRAND NEW","review":"Ive used this product before whenever I got my pedicures, but this time I decided to order my own and save the money$$, but when this was shipped here it was spilled everywhere it was not brand new!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"After reading the great reviews I purchased this, didn't work for me, not sure if it was expired but it just did not work at all.

Works fast & super fair price!!!!","review":"Very fast & effective. How much would I pay now that I've used it? A whole lot more than this.I am SO tired of having a pedicure & being hard sold on adding a callus remover treatment for an extra $5 to $15. Seriously gang, this product works as well or better than what they use professionally.How do I use it? Well, I don't take time to do the full soak first then apply, wait & scrub. I get in the shower, shampoo & put conditioner on. I turn off shower, put this all over my calluses to soak in while I soap up & shave, then scrub this off with a Mr. Pumice, and rinse everything at once. It probably adds 2 minutes total.If I did the recommended process on the bottle, it would work even better. For less than $8, I think it costs me about 20 cents each use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product I have tried","review":"I hate calluses and I get them all the time. I've tried most products out there and like a lot of other reviewers, I've had this used on me at the salon. I think it is amazing and does a great job. I followed all the instuctions, and also wrapped my feet in plastic wrap (what they do at the salon) for the few minutes it was on. It worked great even the first time. One foot was on a little longer than 5 minutes because I was working on the other one. It didn't bother me at all, did not seem to effect the non callused skin at all.

It just didn't last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what to do with these...","review":"First of all, I was not expecting these to be the hard plastic that they turned out to be. I can't let my dog catch these -- if she catches it, I can hear the plastic cracking against her teeth and if she's a little off target, I can actually hear the thud when it hits her in the skull. They also don't fly that well. The shape is great for tug, but the hard plastic makes tug not only unsatisfying for my dog, but worries me as far as safety. My dog did enjoy stealing one of these from the counter and destroying it. I've been finding prickly, tiny shards of chewed up plastic for a month now. Since I know my dog likes to kill her toys, I ordered three of these at one time -- I still have two, but I let kids who come to visit play with them. They make great imaginary steering wheels and who knows what else for imaginative minds. As dog toys, however, I just don't understand what the designer was thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Omega not so pet friendly","review":"Our pup enjoyed the idea of chasing the Omega disk but she had some trouble trying to pick it up.

Sure they came out with DBZ Kai on blu ray but Kai is just a version of dbz with all the anticipation (filler) cut out. If you don't wont this item don't buy it but please don't bring down the dbz rating with your one star reviews about how you are cheap. Dragon Ball Z is property of FUNimation and they can do what they wish with it. So true fans rejoice and spend a little bit extra to see it in higher quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"When you love something as much as DBZ, you shouldn't mind buying every release that comes out! Blu-Ray makes this series shine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can not stand the 4:3 ratio!!","review":"Like many here I am a huge DBZ fan as I grew up with it as a child when it was on Toonami. I love the fact that the series has caught up with the times and has been remastered in such beautiful picture quality. The episodes are just as I remember them so long ago and are awesome to watch as an adult now. I do however have some major complaints. One is the price of each Blu Ray disc, 17 episodes is not really a fair trade off for the price. Two I can not stand the aspect ratio being stuck at 4:3. I understand that this is how it was originally was aired, but I would like it to at the least fit my screen. Maybe I am a bit OCD but having a 4:3 aspect being played within a 16:9 black box sucks. I really hope they don't carry this trend over in to the newer episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the HD?","review":"After updating the firmware, I had hoped that would change the lack of quality on this disc. Nope! Dragon Ball Z Kai looked better. This has no 16x9 aspect ratio, just 4:3 on a 16x9 screen. Extremely grainy, Sound is okay, but not worth the money. If you own it on regular DVD that should suffice for now. Save yourselves about 25 dollars do not buy this. You'd be better off buying the action figures. It clearly was not what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious? 17 Episodes for $25?","review":"The fact that there are 291 episodes means there will be $449.82 worth of Blu-Ray in this collection (18 discs). I'd be a lot happier with each saga on it's own blu-ray mini box set, then to end up with 18 separate discs costing a fortune.And this is after releasing a terrible Kai edition of DBZ saga nearly gutting it to nothingness.Absolutely AWFUL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"When I heard funimation was releasing the dragonbox, I decided to hold out on buying them because I figure they might one day release Dragon Ball Z on Blu Ray. Considering Funimation has released this series 4 times already. So finally I got my wish. But the problem is this set is only 17 episode long. Come on funimation this set should be at least 30 episodes long. This show has been release 4 times by you. I understand if this was one piece which isn't that popular, it needs a fanbase in america and its never been officially released in the states. But this is dragon ball z its been released 4 times in america and its got the biggest anime fanbase in america right next to naruto.I reccommend that you skip this and wait until funimation releases dragonball z blu ray box sets with more episodes considering the fact that this series is 291 episodes long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really HD, don't buy this yet.","review":"Just to inform those on the fence about this release, it is not true HD. If it was, it would be 1920x1080p resolution, which is 16:9. This is 4:3 however, so Funimation is scamming the public. If you own the original season sets, stick with those and play them on your 360/PS3/Blu-Ray player in order to upscale to HD. They look just as good and are 16:9. These new sets are rip-offs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I love how they are re-releasing the orange bricks on blu-ray, but with like half the amount of episodes as the orange brick season 1 box and for pretty much around the same price (actually I think you can find season 1 for pretty cheap now). If you are looking for DBZ boxsets, I highly recommend the dragonbox sets. They were cleaned up and still in 4:3 (none of that \\"remastered\\" wide screen crap that ruined the film quality in the orange bricks) with the original Japanese audio and english dubs. You get way more for the price range of the dragonbox compared to this blu-ray crap thats most likely the terrible orange bricks just thrown onto a blu-ray disc and has less episodes on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overly simplified, but good for a lower level class","review":"I'm using this book in a 300 level college course right now, but I feel like it is a little simplified for that. It boils history down to tiny little paragraphs with little detail. However, if you want something simple for an intermediate level class, this is a very good one.

Running is basically a simplistic sport but to extend oneself to the extent to complete a marathon requires a special effort which this book manages to capture better than any other I've read so far. A must for anyone interested in running or those trying to figure out what makes people do this crazy stuff. Easy reading and wonderful photography!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration for Marathon Training","review":"I enjoyed this book, which covered a number of aspects of running marathons, from the history of the marathon, to running gear, to the emotions involved.

No. Just the history of the marathon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, but a decent way to kill a couple of hours.","review":"Bunshinsaba (Byeong-ki Ahn, 2004)Mediocre and derivative Korean horror flick that draws on years of better work without offering anything new or interesting to the mix. Yu-jin (Se-eun Lee) and her mother move back to her mother's old village. In true outsider fashion, the local kids gang up on her, and she places a curse on the four ringleaders with a ouija board. (Does this sound familiar?) They start to die off, and Yu-jin has to figure out what she's done, and how to undo it, with the help of a couple of sympathetic teachers. It's not a terrible way to kill an hour and a half, because it has the usual Asian-horror-film atmosphere in spades, but if you grab another Tartan Asia Extreme flick off the shelf at random, you've got a pretty good chance of finding something scarier/more interesting/more original/etc. **"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good textbook","review":"It is helpful to have a second copy of my son's very heavy 9th grade textbook, in order to save on treatments for back pain from carrying the book back and forth to school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book so far","review":"I haven't finished this book, but so far, it helps me see things in a new perspective.

I appreciated the author's approach and explanation of several discipline techniques-many of which of which were logical no-brainers. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is it left out several discipline problems I have with my four year-old; for instance, bedtime. Withholding a bedtime story until he \\"settles down\\" is not an option in our house--it was not a motivater for my child. We did however use his method and inadvertently bedtime has gotten easier. The main idea is, as always, parental CONSISTENCY. A challenge for many of us I'm sure......All in all though, this book is definitely worth a look. I got a lot of good ideas and for us it was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, practical info.","review":"I am picky about parenting books but read this one through (ok, it was repetetive so skimmed it is more accurate). Lots of examples and practical use of the theory.

I found it VERY useful. My son is definitely strong-willed, and adopting the methods in this book has made my child more responsive to my requests and has made me far more relaxed about parenting and discipline. This book is useful even if your child is not intensely strong-willed - the book teaches good discipline techniques which apply regardless of your child's temperment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great practical advice!","review":"This book seemed like it was written about my 4 year old.

Most of the examples in the book were for older children, but I'm glad I read it at this early stage.

I have my power back, I feel more confident in my parenting and I don't get fraustrated and upset with her. More importantly, we are building a mutually respectful and loving relationship.

She's a strong willed child. She pretty much has all the characteristics of a strong-willed child outlined in this book.

I highly recommend this book to any parent having endless power struggles with their child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle for our Family!","review":"This book was loaned to us by a friend who felt it might help us sort through some trying times with our toddler who was definitely testing our limits...and driving us crazy. Even though most of the examples used in the book are about older children, we found that almost all of the situations could apply to a limit-testing two-year old. My husband and I both read the book cover to cover, started applying the suggested methods right away, and saw immediate improvement. Bedtime resistance that used to carry on for several hours was suddenly non-existent, tantrums have disappeared, and we all just seem to understand each other now. I NEVER thought it could happen so fast, and that change could come about so easily. The book helps you understand that no matter what kind of disciplinarian you are, you can make some very simple, common-sense changes and see immediate results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful ideas","review":"This book was great when I used what I agreed with and ignored the parts I didn't. We were getting in nightly arguments with our then three-year-old and the book told us to not let the kid get us in an argument - instead go straight to the consequence before tension grows. This worked wonders for our strong-willed child (granted, he is not nearly as strong-willed as I know other kids can be). There were parts I completely ignored such as it recommends that when a timeout is over, let the problem drop. I would rather talk to my kid about why he got the timeout afterward when he's calmer and more rational. The book also gives gives corny (and too perfectly constructed) examples. But since tension significantly reduced after implementing the parts I agreed with, I can easily overlook these downfalls."},{"rating":"2","title":"life saver","review":"this book was fabulous! i was at the end of my rope with my 4 year old. endless arguing, giving chance after chance- this book brought the simple fact to light that its ok not to give one more chance. the book is an easy read with great examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sound, interesting book for disciplining a strong-willed child","review":"I enjoyed reading this book and learned many useful techniques. Even though my strong-willed child is only two-years-old, I learned a few techniques that I could use now as well as many techniques to be used later. Robert MacKenzie, EdD gives many simple, yet practical, examples to strengthen his points. Although slightly repetitive, the book emphasizes the imprtance of using well-reasoned action to discipline a child rather than words. I look forward to re-reading the book in a few years to make sure that I stay on-track with disciplining my strong-willed child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books out there","review":"This book is based on the ideas inPositive Discipline. There is practically nothing new, except the idea that a spirited child will test your limits again and again, so you have to be even more consistent. There! Now that you know that, just get the Positive Discipline, which is excellent. It describes the background of the method, specific approaches, gives you ideas for all ages. \\"Setting Limits\\", btw, is much harder to adapt to a toddler.

Hopefully, in the future I will preach on some of the ideas that I have gained. This book deals with the \\"Strong Willed Child.\\" Really, what child is not strong willed. Also, why read a book on the weak willed child. Who needs a book on this. So I started out at the top. This book was excellent. It laid a great foundation for parenting but also provided practical steps and advice for common situations. This book I would highly recommend to parents of all kids. It has been a huge help to me in training my children. I feel more empowered and in control. As a parent gains more insights into parenting, the better the family life will become.

But they just had to ruin it with all the \\"poo poo pee pee\\" humor that the creators obviously thought would guarantee laughs from the kiddies. My two little cousins laughed maybe once or twice through the whole movie and it wasn't because of those stupid jokes. Don't get me wrong, I can enjoy that kind of humor, but this was just embarrassing.And I'm really hoping this is the last time we see the Rugrats in a movie because I'm sick of them. Like I said before, pairing them up with The Wild Thornberries seemed interesting but it just went down hill. The only good episodes of the Rugrats were the old ones, now those were funny. And now it's been what, 13 years? End it for God's sake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well","review":"Ok, well I highly recomend this movie to anyone under the age of 7, because my 8 yr old brothers and sister did not like it, but on the other hand, my 5 yr old cousin did. I highly recomend Finding Nemo over this one, the entire family could enjoy that, and you can also enjoy Finding Nemo without every other sentence having potty humor in it, and seriously, the potty humor gets old, FAST. It starts out decent, then has a very very long stretch of being horrible, then it builds back up to the decent point for a few minutes, then it ends... I couldn't stand this movie, but then again I'm a 15 years old and I have a life. So I recomend it to the very young audience, but anyone else, go see something of really good quality like Finding Nemo or Bruce Almighty(which I thought was going to be a terrible movie but turned out very good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great compact camera/ video","review":"this is a great easy to use camera. you can also take video with it ,it is small enough to put in a fanny pack or pocketbook. i love it you can also buy an sd card 1 gig. well buy it its a great price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Made for a 4 year Old...Horrible Toy","review":"This was the most horrible toy..And no one else makes a pirate ship anymore.

I decided on the 28-70 mostly because of the 2.8 aperture at the wide end that seemed worth the extra $10 over the kit lens. While I do not have much to compare it with, the lens feels solid, the auto-focus is fast enough for me (it is a little loud, but I don't mind that) the range is good, and the lens does fairly well in low-light situations. I try to keep it at at least f/3.5 at the wide end, though, because the f/2.8 is pretty soft. I love the bokeh produced at f/4, 70mm also. Overall, I am happy with the lens, for $130 it's pretty great. ; )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lens, did not last very long.","review":"Bought this lens back in February 2006.

If you have read the wonderful (yet hard to find) Vampire novel; The Vampire Tapestry, then this film will seem very familiar. What is important to note is this movie is free of the Made for TV cheese and the Hyper Goth/Romanti-Erotic BS so common in most modern Vampire stories. Without giving too much away, it is the perceived and then logically deduced relationship of the human regarding his Vampire captive that truly make this movie above even most higher budget Vampire films. Sure, the production value is weak at times and gaps in the character's logic (well, one character named Javi, anyway) but I have to applaud the writer/director's desire to show a vampire as a cold and calculating hunter with a shadow of it's once human life. The leads are both actually quite good as is Michael Biehn in the only really good supporting role in the film. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's 103 minutes R&R time I ain't never gonna get back","review":"Wow. I'm almost speechless at how horrid this was. I DVR'd it because I love Michael Beihn.

It was made for only 250k and in these days of 200million dollar budgets that in itself was well worth the viewing. I highly recommend this movie....

The variation on the legend in this production adds to its believability. The two leads are excellent. It is also kind of a tribute to nerds everywhere. The male lead is your classic \\"amiable\\" personality type played to perfection by Flanery. You really feel for him. The female lead is so hot! At first she is ruthless but then one starts to like her and we find ourselves in the same trap as the main character. He knows she is evil but he can't kill her.

Bought this cd and I've been hooked for the past month or so listening to it constantly. It reminds me a little of early Live (pain lies on the riverside). Just good rock and roll. Guitar is nice and loud in parts and soft in others. Lots of acoustic parts. Vocals are awesome. Dude's got that raspy voice that mixes well with such great guitar work. My copy came with a bonus cd with live tracks; not sure if this one does though. These guys are Dutch, but sing in English.

If you are chasing beta, then this work will assist you. For example, many stock sectors will respond to a move in the underlying commodity, from the bond sensitives through to resource stocks.With the growing importance of the trend followers to take markets to extremes, Larry's new work filters out the occassions when the commercials are not in control, ie, when they make up a low percentage of open interest.All serious market participants should find this work insightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promotional material","review":"I have several of Larry's books and some are really good. But this one is probably the worst book I have ever read coming from him. The title is misleading, the subject of stocks is almost totally ignored.

It is hard to imagine a reader who will not find something they are interested in this book. He is writing to relieve some kind of artistic tension.

It just get so boring that I use the cd as a coaster to put my beer onto. Keep the drummer, lose the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast but Boring","review":"This is my first Marduk album. Panzer Division Marduk is for those people who like blisteringly fast repetitive music. If you like simple guitar tunes repeated ad infinitum with repetitive drumming, this album is for you.However, if you prefer any variety in the songs in the album, this is about as bad as it gets.The speed and ferocity of the initial listen quickly wears as one proceeds through each track. Vocals and tank cannon blasts are about the only thing which passes muster here. Guitars are boring. Drumming is boringly repetitive. You could take the \\"chorus\\" of any track and strap it on to any other, and not know the difference! Trust me after the third song, you will probably turn this thing off.I would avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poserdivision Mardu(c)k","review":"Mardu(c)k finally managed to release the most stupid, sluggish and ridiculous album of all its musical career. Stupid trendies who describe this load of mush as the most evil and brutal album should take advice about a gray matter graft, they obviously don't know anything about true extreme metal. In fact, the drumming is drum-machine like (the weak sort), the guitars are absolutely non-saturated (and even melodic at most times) and the babbling of the poser-singer is utterly ridiculous, not mentionning the stupid song titles or lyrics. Concerning speed, any average death or false-black band is at least as fast as Morgan Posehand and his followers, in fact much faster and violent bands have been around for a long time (Brutal Truth, Chainsaw, Krisiun, etc. ...). Hundreds of false black bands have done this before (e.g. Enthroned, Dark Funeral, etc...) and many will continue to do so. So let us annihilate the made-up trendies."},{"rating":"2","title":"insane","review":"first, let's get one thing straight, marduk rules black metal, period... comprende? having said that, this is not one of their better albums, but it is still brutally extreme with blistering speed. average song length is just under or just over 3 minutes... which can be typical depending on which style of black metal you are referring to. but what i'm getting at is that there isn't much deversity on this album, they all pretty much sound the same. the exception is \\"christ-raping black metal\\"... this song has a relentless ferocity to it that is unmatched by any other song on the album. remember, when we're talking marduk, we're talking seriously evil and fast metal, so keep that in mind when reading this. marduk has better albums, but this one is still very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Black/War Metal Assault","review":"PDM is my favorite Marduk album, even topping \\"La Grande Danse Macabre\\".

My original reason for reading this was a fascination with the concept of a priest and a rabbi reading scripture together. The reading is much more than the concept. Greeley's section on the Song of Songs will create a new wonder for your relationship with God. Neusner's insight into the Torah and the Holocaust let's you know what wonders and answers are available from the word of God.

Even if you have to read certain things over again, you pretty much get it after looking the material over for the third time. I read the first two chapters and mostly everything is still in my mind. The author makes chemistry interesting by using real life examples to reinforce the material. He has the gift of gab and ANYONE who is struggling with chemistry whether it's high school and college chem, this book with HELP you get an A. I'm very impressed and happy that I bought.

After a week of waiting for a response that was never received I called the company. I was told that no one there could help me because only the owner could sign into the Amazon account, and he was at church at 7:00 pm on a monday night.

Alvin, who played guitar and let brother Phil sing in the Blasters and then John Doe and Exene sing in X, has come into his own as an expressive singer, albeit one with limited range.His choices are inspired, as are the arrangements. He turns Jackson Browne's \\"Redneck Friend\\" into a slinky lounge shuffle. He resurrects John Stewart's \\"California Bloodlines\\" and makes Tom Waits's \\"Blind Love,\\" a bluesy affirmation. Kate Wolf's \\"Here in California\\" is a beautiful centerpiece while John Fogerty's \\"Don't Look Now\\" becomes a front porch stomper. The only missed note is Brian Wilson's \\"Surfer Girl,\\" the closer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of heart, but...","review":"First off, I admire Dave Alvin a great deal. He is in fact one of my musical heroes. Some of the songs he's written are just flat out fantastic. But it isn't just the music. It's the person as well. In the music business, integrity is almost impossible to find. Dave has more integrity in his left pinky than most people do in their whole bodies.That said, Dave isn't really a singer. He works hard at it, but the instrument just isn't there. He does a great job with his own songs. When he starts singing other people's stuff, though, it can get dicey. He's an outstanding producer and the production here is wonderful. But when it all comes down to it, most of the songs on this album need someone with the kind of vocal range Dave doesn't have. I admire him for taking the risk of putting this CD together. I'm sure it was a labor of love. But it's not a pleasing listen for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointed","review":"I've followed Dave since his days with the Blasters, This CD is such a dissapointment.

One would never connect this music to Heat without the liner notes, sounding like any given random synthesist with a beatbox and some flangers.If internal Heat comes from radioactivity, the \\"Internal Clock\\" of this one indicates decay to a mere leaden state -- the term \\"deservedly obscure\\" comes to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"song quality","review":"First impression is that it didnt take too long to produce this CD, was only one song I liked so I bought it when I saw a good deal on it hoping some other songs would be good as well, nope."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor imitation of the real kimba","review":"the soundtrack and voices aren't the origional kimba.

The package came in a timely manner and the cover looked to be of nice quality and matched the color from online accurately. I washed the cover first, because it smelled \\"new\\" after trying to put it on the futon mattress I noticed a small hole next to one of the seems, which i am positive my new washer and dryer did not do! While trying to put it on the mattress, which was proving to be quite difficult, the zipper completely ripped!! My husband tried to fix it for 45 minutes with no avail.

I will often do this routine and then do 30 minutes of weight training using other Crunch DVDs, like Boot Camp. It's also great just by itself for days you just want a lighter workout. The instructor is very encouraging and pleasant. I really like this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for it.","review":"I'm an overweight 48 year old female & I found this dvd hard to follow. She didn't stick with one movement long enough for me to catch on to the steps. Maybe as I continue to use the dvd I'll get the step before she moves on to another but at this point, I'd rather put in a different dvd which I can actually work out with. I would not purchase this product again, nor will I try any of her other dvd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Short!","review":"I bought this DVD because of all of the good reviews I read here on Amazon.com. I was disappointed. The workout is only 30 minutes and couple that with the low intensity and I don't think it's worth the money.So I'm not totally negative, I will say that it is fun and well instructed but I'm definietly going to have to combine this with other DVD's to get a good workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work out","review":"I was having a hard time getting into a regular work out routine, but I noticed that I had NO problem dancing around for an hour while i did house work, so i thought, why not get a DANCE work out video?This video is great at working up a sweat, and the instructor is encouraging and fun - even adorable! I had a little bit of trouble the first few times I did the video simply because this program moves quickly at times and I've never really danced in my life, and I sort of lack coordination, but i got the hang of it after a while. Overall, it's a good work out!Grade: A-"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun, upbeat, and motivating","review":"I've got a large library of exercise DVD's, some of them boring, others okay, and a few that are just plain fun. This one falls in the latter category...it makes you want to move, with simple instruction, but also dance moves that are more than the simple basics you sometimes get. She breaks it down, then speeds it up, then puts together 3 different moves, and you repeat it twice a few times, and then one of each for another few times until you really get it. It's a good length as well, about 40 minutes.Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner Cardio but heavy on the dance moves","review":"I find that I am slow to work up a sweat with Cardio Dance Blast. I am learning some new dance moves though! Once you get the dance steps down you can get the movement going better. I am not a 'dancer' so for me the dance moves are a challenge to follow. The up side is the 20 mins goes real fast, you have a bit of fun with it, but I find I get a better cardio workout with traditional exercises lunges, squats, jumps etc.. This dvd is ok if you are bored with your current exercise routine and want to mix things up a little, but definitely not a dvd I would use as my primary resource to be (or get) fit. I would consider this a light cardio workout. Probably better for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Light to Intermediate Workout","review":"This is a great workout if you only want about 30 minutes. It is a fun dance workout, you don't even realize you are working out, I would highly recommend this DVD if you like an easy to follow dance workout!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I hadn't bought this one","review":"I've been doing exerecise videos off & on for quite a while,but have never been as frustrated as I was with this one! I felt that the \\"costumes\\" were distracting, instructions were murky, not enough time given to slowly demonstrating the steps before adding them to the routine. Camera work left something to be desired, too. This video seemed more like a video of assorted dancers for you to watch-not participate in. And the wild-haired blond on the right (as you view the video) was too much the main focus, and watching her certainly didn't help if you wanted to learn the steps. The steps & movements used in this video needed to have quite a bit more clear, concise teaching to make this fun to do. I just felt frustrated and upset when it was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"goog workout","review":"You do feel this workout and end up sweaty and energized.

I really made me feel uncoordinated and frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, simple workout","review":"Marie is a great instructor - her cues are right on target and she is upbeat without being annoying. The dance moves are fun. Overall I really like this workout, but it only gets 4 stars because I tend to watch the clock more with this DVD than with my other workouts. The moves can get a bit repetitive at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"for those with excellent coordination only","review":"this work out is poorly designed because the instructor (who could clearly be a professional dancer) spends almost no time teaching you how to do somewhat complicated moves. she'll break the move down initially and repeat it about two times before bringing it up to full speed and adding in arm movements. i'm not the best dancer in the world and was looking for a good work out with some dance tecniques to boot. well, this was not it. so unless you already are an accomplished dancer, this dvd will just make you feel pathetic and frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crunch Cardio Dance Blast","review":"This is only good for people who already know how to do professional dance moves. It went very quickly, and did not give much time to learn the moves before it went on to the next thing. Only do this if you are VERY coordinated and know how to dance well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little to 'hip' for me...","review":"This video was not for me. I like really fast paced workouts. This felt slow to me, too much rolling of the hips and flinging of the arms to really get going on your feet. The instructor annoyed me as well, and I couldn't focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I didn't care for this DVD. First, it's too fast -- even the instructional part. I also found it too complicated to remember all the steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!!","review":"It was really hard to follow and it just frustrated me! I dont recommend this to anybody ;( it was a waste of money in my view,not worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be kidding","review":"I have learned my lesson........I will not buy another workout dvd without reading the reviews first. I tried this dvd this morning and the only reason it is still on the shelf is because I am struggling with throwing it away and \\"wasting\\" the money. In the end it will be in the garbage - while the video is broken down into different segments the moves are not easy to learn and then she is on to the next thing. In addition to not \\"getting\\" the moves I didn't raise my heart rate at all. I felt like I should put in one of my other dvd's and start over."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and fun workout!","review":"My friend let me borrow her copy and I love it. Some of the moves are a bit awkward (and you can't help but laugh) but you really feel the burn when doing it. I enjoyed working out to it, which is saying a lot because I hate to work out and have never had fun doing a workout video. The only fault I found was if you're not used to the dance steps it takes a few times doing it to be able to keep up."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I wanted a change from kickboxing all the time so I thought \\"hey dancing\\" hopefully it's like Jazzercise(which I loved), well it's not. She went to fast and I couldn't keep up. I think I am coordinated, I used to dance...25 years ago (I'm 40!!yeah!!) This was NOT for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of Fun","review":"I think this workout is a lot of fun and Forleo's abs are a great motivator. There are some more boring parts, but that's more because I don't like hip hop. I loved the salsa dancing. I'm a beginning and uncoordinated exerciser and while it took me a while to get the moves down, it also gets my heartrate up and me sweating."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to add intensity to work up a sweat, but it's fun","review":"I really like this cardio workout. The moves are fun and the six segments seem to fly by. Granted, I would not do the dance steps in front of other people, but in the privacy of home, they make for an entertaining workout. You have to add your own intensity, though. If you were to do the moves as instructed, you won't work up much of a sweat. I add bounce and hops to increase my heart rate. The instructor's cues are good and she doesn't talk too much to be annoying. Some of the outfits the background dancers are a little odd -- jeans, ripped camouflage pants, bikini top, and hats. Overall, I'd recommend this to those who enjoy dance workouts. If you're looking for intense cardio, though, this video is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, albeit cheesy, workout!","review":"Cardio Dance Blast is a fun workout to throw into the weekly mix. You'll break a sweat, but I wouldn't call this a difficult exercise routine by any means. The hip-thrusting and shimmying is a bit distracting, but once I got into it I started to enjoy it. If you don't have that \\"funky edge\\" you might find yourself kicking your husband/significant other out of the room - some of the moves made me feel just plain silly! The instructor is friendly, the music is typical synthesized aerobics fare. Overall I found it to be a nice addition to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite crap really","review":"The video isn't really what I would call \\"Cardio\\", rather a series of jogging on the spot, bottom wiggling & arm waving. Didn't challenge me at all & wasn't tired at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT DANCING","review":"If you are looking to get some cardio activity from dance keep looking. If you try any of these moves in a club prepare to never be let in again! This video is is the same old cheesey aerobics routines only with the participants wearing \\"club\\" clothing instead of spandex. I was very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use at your own risk!","review":"Despite the instructor's professional appearance, the workout appears dangerous! If you blink, you might miss the warmup. This is followed by complex, frustrating routines for which no guidance is given to personal safety (i.e. injury prevention). I consider myself an intermediate-advanced level fitness participant. Yet I couldn't adequately follow the routines. Worse, I was concerned I'd be out-of-comission for alternative workouts after trying to complete some of the moves. Find yourself something less challenging/frustrating to follow that's a lot safer! Note: if you have a GREAT deal of prior experience with dance, then you may enjoy this tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"This United American Video Issue Is In Long Play Mode","review":"This VHS issue is a poor quality issue in long play mode.

I was not trying to cut any limbs larger than it was rated for and I was not trying to cut any dead wood. From the first cut I noticed that it took much more force to cut than my other Corona loppers and then on the fourth cut one handle snapped in two and I am not a particularly strong person.

But this collection of songs is definitely second-rate compared to the real Motown classics we are all familiar with.My opinion is that the songwriting is the primary reason that these songs don't stack up to the classic Motown hits. I think this is confirmed because the Funk Brothers do some odd instrument arrangements on a lot of these songs that you don't hear on the known classics...and I think that is because they were trying to spice up the weak songwriting to make them sound more interesting.There was a reason these were never released before: there are no hits on this collection. Berry Gordy knew what he was doing.This is for completists and collectors only."},{"rating":"2","title":"like a buried treasure","review":"Some of the grooves on \\"Cellarful\\" are as great as their more famous cousins that saw the light of day back in the 60's. I wonder if Berry Gordy and the rest of Motown's A&R crew intentionally held onto some of this gold for some crazy reason. \\"I Like Everything About You\\" by Dennis Edwards and the Contours #8 on Disc I (correct your track listing info) is pure and timeless Motown almost 40 years later. \\"A Definite Change in You\\" by the Tempts, \\"Are You Sure Love is the Name of This Game\\" by Stevie. On and on, some of these tunes are priceless. Sit back (as long as you can sit) and take a listen, you'll bound to hear a tune(s) you'll love. Guaranteed. It's been said that there's musical gems in the Motown vaults. \\"Cellarful\\" confirms that. These tunes are some of the gems \\"they\\" were talking of.

We were very pleased to see Toys R Us start selling Playmobil. He is 10 now and loves his castle. The Castle and the pirate things we have bought are so far the best money we have ever spent on toys. The 3 rating for durablity is because one small piece broke because a friend stepped on it. This is definatley not a toy that children smaller than 4 should be able to get their hands on. There are lots of small detailed pieces that a toddler isn't ready to keep track of. Our son is responsible and takes care of his toys but I can see some kids just tearing this castle up.

You see, the older women I interviewed may have incomes well below the poverty level, but few saw themselves as \\"poor\\" or even \\"needy.\\" So when I speak describe the unbelievable hardships these women have overcome. I also mention how strong and grateful they are. The typical response from media and policy-makers is, \\"These women are great! They're poor, but happy. We don't need to do anything!\\" I point out the incredible waste of human energy when a woman spends all her effort and strength on a struggle to survive - even the unfairness that her gender has exposed her to elevated risk of poverty.

It curled up around your body, firmly squeezing your arms to your body. I can't wait to return this item. I guess it was due to the hammock not having any slats at the head and foot areas. We have learned a lesson!! The quality appeared to be very good.We were so looking forward to relaxing in our new hammock. This was a big dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable, doesn't hold up to weather...","review":"Hammock is ok quality, and a decent price, but it isn't the most comfortable. You feel like you're slumped into a sling, and you need large trees or posts to tie it to. If you want a comfortable hammock, or you want to use a stand, get hammock with wood bars. I bought one from ExoticHammocks for about $50 and gave away my Amazona. Also, look for a hammock with nylon or polyester. Cotton hammocks rot and fade."},{"rating":"2","title":"CAW!","review":"She's so adorable and soft! The only problem I have is that the wings you have to use 2 hands to work and the beak takes 1 hand to work so I don't know about you but I only have 2 hands and arms not 3. Also, the way you put your hands in the wings to \\"flap\\" them the wings appear backwards or upside-down to me... (I'm not sure why.) I bought this to accompy my Folkmanis snowy owl and more-so to accompy my \\"The Wiz\\" soundtrack and DVD! She goes well with the Scarecrow song: \\"You Can't Win\\". I enjoy dancing with her. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Puppet","review":"The yellow-beaked crow is a nice puppet. The beak / mouth of puppet is a little tight if you have large hands.

I sent it to her for Valentine's Day, and she told me she tried a recipe just tonight and it was FABULOUS! She said it was a rather labor-intensive recipe and that she will probably modify it to make it quicker. This is what she usually does...but she was thrilled with the photos AND the recipes. A+++ and fast shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This is essentially a text book.The level of writing makes it appear that this book is intended for the instruction of adolescents, and considering the rather recent date of publication they would have to be remarkably atypically \\"innocent\\" for this day and age. The questions intended to stimulate discussion are embarrassingly simpleminded in many cases. It is difficult to imagine that this book wouldn't be laughed out of the classroom by most of today's students.An appendix in the back of the book contain an acceptable translation of the Latin lyrics by someone other than the author. However, the body of the book contains the author's renderings of the Latin poems as well as her comments. What she has done to the poems is a travesty - even as \\"free\\" renderings they go way beyond what is acceptable in giving an unfamiliar audience an understanding of the originals.This has almost nothing to recommend it - there are many that are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good book.","review":"Sebesta's Cantiones Profanae is excellent as BOTH a textbook and an analysis of this beautiful medieval poetry. Sebesta's translations make for good reading, and the original text with glossaries on the opposing page make this a textbook conducive to both learning and reading for pleasure. We used this book in my university Latin class, and it was both challenging and insightful. It gives a glimpse into medieval European life not often shown in most history classes. I heartily recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick book, thin content","review":"This book totally sucks.

If you haven't certified on a fairly recent MS OS, this might be of use to you, but do not stop with this book. If really just scratches the surface. Most of the topics covered in the book (it does cover the objectives in a superficial way) are things the 70-270 test takes for granted you know. If you are 2000 certified, you want something else more geared to the specific differences between XP and 2000. The guide does include specific additional reading, usually from the Resource Kit or the Knowledge Base, and many hands-on lab setups (you need a 2 or 3 pc network, with 2000 Server on one).

More times than always, I usually like what I buy based on review. EXCEPT this time. I love Superman, but this book was boring. It started off interesting with Jonathan Kent's dream about Superboy, but quickly went downhill. In the book, Clar, Lana and Lex all went to high school together. It makes no sense why Superman would take Lois to Smallville and tell her he was raised in Smallville. HELLO, isn't that giving away his identity as Clark Kent? Maybe this book was a hit when it came out in the early 80s. I found nothing interesting about it. The demon from the pits of hell doesn't make a good villian and while its only a 200 page book, it seemed to take forever to read. I am glad I only paid a penny for it. Do yourself a favor, check your library for it before you buy it. Its only worth a penny if you feel you want to take a chance and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book is about a girl named Peggy who's dad is a minister.

DONT BUY IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Even Better Street!","review":"I've played all of the NBA Street games since the PS2 and Xbox versions. I think this is a nice fourth installment. I questioned it for some reason last year when I had it for the 360, but I purchased it for the PS3 and I really like it. It has a very high replay value. Unlike the NBA Live 08 or NBA 2K8, it's fun and not too serious. I mean all the power up moves are like NBA Jam (arcadic). I just think when you play video games they should be fun and no too serious. I like how you can play w/ or w/o a shirt and being a female I like the WNBA option as well. All and all it's a lot of fun, plus now it's like $30 not $60 like when it first came out and that makes it even better.You cannot go wrong w/ buying or renting this game, you won't be dissappointed.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Worship CD","review":"I bought this CD looking for the relatively unknown \\"Where You Lead Me, I Will Follow\\" song, as I had heard it on a local station.

Unfortunately, this CD is full of several live versions and almost unrecognizable remakes of original songs. Some versions are almost laughably lame, perhaps on purpose.

Since then I have been reading the poets included in \\"Revolution\\". Rothenberg's anthology is a must read for anyone interested in avant garde poetry from 1914-1945 and beyond. Rothenberg's introduction to \\"Revolution\\" not only provides a lucid introduction to the anthology, but also provides a good place from which to begin to approach the rich poetry of the avant garde that he collects in his later 2 volume \\"Poems for the Millenium\\". I haven't found a better introduction to the avant garde tradition than \\"Revolution\\". I'm excited that I'll finally be able to add it to my personal library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete? well...","review":"I am about to set up an Internet Radio Station at my university and found this book on Amazon.com. The title suggests that this book is all one needs to know (for me, the words \\"Complete\\" and \\"Manual\\" suggest this. While the thin volume is a quick and easy read (less than the length of a Toyota oil change), it really doesn't contain much specific information, especially for the cost. Also, as a college professor, I was turned off by the frequent mechanical errors (including missing words) in the writing.The book is a helpful introduction to the topic, and contains a potentially useful bibliography, but..the price is too steep for a spiral bound book with so little specific info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calendar kit","review":"Overall the calendar is great.

I was in a major chain store and it was on clearance, so I thought it would be a great Mother's Day Gift. The packaging was impressive as to what you could do for around ten bucks. When I opened it to start my project the software was not included. I double checked the package and it did state the software was supposed to be there. There was no evidence that the package had been opened and it was clearly sealed by the factory. I remembered that in the store there were about 10 kits on clearance, so beware I guess that the software is in the package! I plan to contact the company to see if they can send me the disk. The paper and covering appears to be of high quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twist on feet and do not last","review":"Despite having the right size for my dog, and tightening these as much as I could, they still would twist on my Australian Shepherd's feet.

His right foot turns outward and the boot would keep getting loose on this foot. I could not get the boot to stay on longer than ten minutes. I was often adjusting it every five minutes or less. I did get the left foot boot to stay on longer. I am reasonably sure that I put these boots on correctly and tightened the strap as tight as I could. THE BIGGER PROBLEM WAS THE WEAR. After an hour walk the toes of his front foot boots showed wear along the seam line.

Written in the continued spirit of the original \\"Roughneck Sonnets\\", All This Way for the Short Ride pays especial tribute to the brave men and women who dare to ride fiercely bucking broncos for as many seconds as they can.

It's basically black foam that looks like someone dabbed GOLD paint with a sponge only on the pertruding parts.That's right...GOLD PAINT. Not only is it ugly but a piece of the foam was missing and I found it in the box. CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP You get what you pay for.

Of course, I tend to find most comedy westerns including Cat Ballou not genuinely funny. Viva Maria, another Bardot movie, is an exception and is a far better movie than this one.Bardot and Cardinale are antagonists. These two ladies develop a growing dislike for each other. At one point, Bardot points out that 'she is starting to annoy me' as Cardinale interrupts her and her sisters while they bath nude in a stream. Their dislike culminates in a fist fight which ends in a draw as both succumb to exhaustion.In the end, however, Bardot and Cardinale emerge as not just friends but as partners as they jump on a train and free their siblings from the hands of the law. All very silly.Some my conclude that Bardot has lost some of her beauty but it appears what she really has lost is too much weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG","review":"Absolutely perfect.

After just a few uses, the black borders already started to fray. I believe that is what everyone is complaining about. A few years later, I decided to buy a deck again, but just for collecting purposes... even just looking at the freaking cards makes the borders fray, so I decided to just use the cards until the die out on me which won't take long. I'm guessing the other decks Ciro makes are the same, based on the similar reviews on his other products. Such great art but whyyyyy with the crappy card material? At least create the material to make it last long for crying out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Guilded Tarot (Book and Tarot Deck Set)","review":"This is a BEAUTIFUL deck of Tarot cards and is accompanied with an explanatary book.

This deck is not just for looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gilded Tarot","review":"This is a delightfully pictured deck. The artist, Ciro, makes the cards so vivid you want to walk into them. I personally bought this deck for the artistic value. However Barbara Moore compliments this art with good interpetations of the tarot. If you are looking for another artistic deck by Ciro look for the newest tarot by him called \\"Tarot of Dreams\\". It is a little pricey but worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring","review":"I made a mistake when I bought this book. I wanted a book and DECK. I've done this before and accepted my mistake bc there were very nice, colored reproductions of the cards in the book. Not so with this one. The explanations of the cards were ho-hum.

I eventually returned this book bc I saw no value in having it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another craptacular deck from Lllewelyn","review":"All I ever hear about this deck is how beautiful it is and blah blah blah. Please. This is just another RWS clone. Great for beginners, but not for people who are looking to add something more original to their Tarot collections.The overall artwork is okay, but my biggest beef is with some of the minors with people being depicted in it (esp. the court cards). This is a CG deck, right? While the Majors are well put together, some of the faces on the characters in the minors do not look like they've been digitally rendered. In some cases they look like they've been cut and pasted onto the bodies. I find that rather half-@$$ed. If you're going to make a CG deck with digitally rendered people, why not go the whole way?I stear clear of Llewelyn's stuff (with the exception of some of the decks from Lo Scarabeo) because they seem to produce a lot of products that are either rehash the same crap from most other books or have no meaning whatsoever. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wimpy Kings","review":"I'll probably get blasted for this, but I think the kings in this deck are weak and ineffective looking.

This is a lovely deck - the art seems to glow with a light of its own against the dark backgrounds. I found the images and design to be very pleasing to the eye, and true to the basic theme of the Rider-Waite deck, with some original and fresh differences. One thing that really impressed me about this product was the companion book. It is ideal for a beginner, because it gives a firm foundation of the structure of the Tarot and why the cards mean what they mean. The discourse about the artwork was also quite interesting and gives additional insight into the nuances of these particular cards. This deck would make a great addition to the cache of any collector of Tarot art, as well as those who use the cards for divination. Buy this deck. You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit too gorgeous at times.","review":"I've got this deck and while I will say that I enjoy reading it, at times the cards are a bit too pretty and it can be distracting.

It takes a while to soak in, but leaves skin feeling smooth & rejuvenated. If you're going to put on the skin after you shower, do it a good 2 hours before you actually go to sleep so it doesn't rub off. I also purchased this specifically because it has a low EWG rating of 1. (Most lotions that have vitamin e in them also have lots of bad chemicals/ingredients). Great product with a decent price...

And that the fact that it is only for use on PC's was written in the manual. Indeed it was. But of course, why was it not written on the outside so that someone would know before buying and using it? She was a bit slow, and when I asked to speak to a supervisor she put me on hold. She would not give me her name and, you guessed it - I was on hold until the battery died on my home cordless phone! So, a complete waste of time and money, deceptive at best. The unnamed customer service rep did tell me that none of their products are mac compatible.

My daughter could only take outdoor pictures, and unlike most digital cameras, there was no screen to see the picture she had just taken. I then tried to download her pictures to the software I had just put on our computer, but had no luck. The instruction manual made it seem \\"simple\\", but my computer wouldn't even recognize the camera hooked up.

This is what James Ussher did when predicting a 4004BC date which scientists laugh at today. I witnessed a debate between Dr. Hugh Ross(old earth) and Ken Hamm(young earth) and the evidence is clearly there for an old earth. God is supernatural but the case for a young earth cannot be argued by the physical laws, they clearly teach that the earth has been around for longer than 10,000 years. Why would God lead us to believe though science that we have an old earth? Science agrees with biblical revelation.

Mike is the vocalist of Los Bravos. Mike Kogel Kennedy is a superstar that is familiar to those of us who like 1960s beat oriented rock. He had solo hits like \\" Louisiana \\" and soft rock hits like \\" Un payaso loco \\" in the early 70s. The material in \\"Midnight Storm\\" is not Beat music, its more of an R+B pop with drum programming. However, it is tastefully arranged and the lyrics are significant and important. The music is full of catchy hooks and its the best material that Mike has released in a long time. It is co-written by songwriter Olivia Gray.

My wife and I put it to the test going to some fairly rural areas and it never failed. It does have glitches that are to be expected.

The only saving grace about having it was knowing (or hoping?) that if we did get terribly lost, we could eventually get back on track with this thing. On the way home, we missed a turn via the printed directions due to confusion over the difference between what the gps said and what the printed directions said. So we went with the gps and it took us a good hour out of our way.Unfortunately I had the same problems with a rented version on another trip down there that I was \\"assured\\" was updated.

It took us a little while to learn how it works and to get through the menus and sub-menus, but we figured it out on a long road trip and it is great! You can find the nearest rest stop up the road, the nearest gas station or restaurant, and it will even tell you where the KOAs and WalMarts are on your route if you are so inclined. As you go down the road, it will tell you about roadside attractions. It starts up fast and locks onto the satellites very quickly, even in downtown areas with lots of tall buildings. We are having a lot of fun with it and it is worth every penny we spent on it. By the way, we bought ours for $199 at the Cabela's in Sidney NE. But if you can get it for $220 - $230 it is still a bargain. No need to get anything more commplex than the c530. Everything else is just bells and whistles. Get the c530.

I haven't used any other GPS before, but I'm very happy with this one, especially after paying only $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"GPS","review":"This model does not state the street's name as the older model. Bit confusing when city streets are so close together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system","review":"This is a great navigation system. I decided on Garmin after a lot of research on the Web and speaking with other people who have GSP navigators. So far it has been very consistent in giving me good directions and it is very easy to use straight out of the box.The only thing it does not offer is \\"highway only\\" or \\"no highways\\" options on the routing. Also, it did not come loaded with the most current map software but Garmin is sending me the newest software at no charge.You won't find a perfect GPS in this price range but this one was close enough for me and so far I am very happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin c530","review":"Great travel tool. But like any tool, it is not perfect. On our initial trip using this product, it had us turn right to arrive at our destination when it should have had us turn left.

I will continue to use this product but will continue to have maps in the car as back-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"I think that this item is as good as it gets for a guy that likes to play with new items that are being developed for us old guys that have trouble reading maps.

Well, we could not get it to turn on, so we called Garmin & they said to send it back. We called Amazon & were very impressed by their customer service. We sent it back & received a new one in 4 days. It is awesome. Very easy to use. We are taking it on a trip across the country & plan on using it a lot as we are taking secondary roads. We highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Route Capability","review":"Just got a return note from Garmin Support. Although advertised as having Routes and waypoints, it just isn't so. Using MapSource on your computer (which you must request) leaves something to be desired. After all the hassle of learning MapSource(not worth getting into here), I uploaded the Routes and Waypoints. In the favorites, just the waypoints appear. Figured I was doing something wrong. Contacted Garmin. They confirmed. The Nuvi 660 (and the C530) does not support routes. So, if you wish to plan trips before going on them, forget Garmin. I'm looking elsewhere, and looking to return my (daughters presents) units.Too be fair, the C530 unit seems excellent for just getting from here to there. The Nuvi 660 is not worth the extra $300. The MP3 player only works over an FM transmitter (poor), and only handles MP3. No M4A (I could understand the M4P problem, but not the M4A)."},{"rating":"2","title":"StreetPilot c530 is great!","review":"On a recent vacation, we rented this GPS unit to guide us in unfamiliar territory. It is the easiest unit I have ever used and we liked it so much that we bought one! It got the satellites almost the minute we pulled out of the garage, plugging in the destination could not be easier, and being able to ask for the nearest type of store, restaurant, or gas station is invaluable! No more hunting through the yellow pages and wondering where things are located. I absolutely love it and would highly recommend it - the ease of use would make it perfect for anyone who fears technology or hates reading instruction manuals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good GPS for the money","review":"This GPS works very well. You could buy another lower brand for the same money but Garmin is so well known that I decided to buy this one at this price. I am glad I did.It sometimes seems to take you \\"through the city\\" to get somewhere when there is a better way. The bottom line is that it may not always take you the quickest way but it gets you from point A to point B. The time of arrival is very accurate. You can either start driving off route to recalculate if you don't like the route it gives you or you can push the detour button. There are lots of points of interests, all by category. The touch screen is very nice and easy. The screen can be adjusted for day and night driving as well as 3D or 2D. I would recommend this to others for a decent priced GPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn - I made the mistake","review":"Oh well I thought I was getting Lemmy from MotorheadTHIS IS NOT THAT MOVIEIt is not in London but in Nevada !!Anybody know where the 'real' Eat the Rich can be found?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorhead fans BEWARE","review":"This is not the one with the Motorhead soundtrack.

It is alot for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I bought this book, along with a number of others, to find out the nutritional values of different foods. Unfortunately, it is nearly impossible to find a specific food item in this particular book, if it is even included at all.

Only about a half-hour, but it definitly kicks your butt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I did not like this dvd. I did try it out several times and just was not happy with the low-scale surroundings and Harvey constantly barking out orders to everyone.

Overall it's much better than most rock stars' bios but it's true, there is no spark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I'm a huge Charlie Watts fan, and was delighted to see a \\"biography\\" about him finally published. But this book is more about the UK jazz and \\"beat\\" scene of the early 1960s, and uses Charlie quotes from numerous sources (admitting that he would not respond to requests by the author for a new interview) that I've read a million times before. Nothing new, and the prose employed by author Clayson quickly tires, leaving the reader exasperated, wondering if the true facts about Charlie and his private life could fill a three page pamphlet. If the subject is truly a private individual, a revealing portrait is tough. Charlie is a truly private individual, and this is a tough read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"New style of Go bot - It turns into a prety cool looking roadster.

Three of them ripped within 5 sessions of just running in the yard. The boots rotate easily around the dog's paws and I think he may have ended up with them on upside down, at which point the thin nylon on top doesn't stand a chance. Maybe this is a fit issue, but I did use the fitting method on the Muttluks website. If you are going to get these boots, I would err on the small side, but overall I can't recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"These sheets are not what I had hoped for. Although they look very nice in the package, they do not fit my 17 inch mattress properly. The front of the package clearly states, \\"Deep pockets fit mattresses up to 18 inches.\\" The fitted sheet does not fit the corners or the sides of the mattress properly. Also, the fabric does not feel like a 600 Thread Count should feel. Perhaps it would soften after many washings. I have 400 TC sheets comparably priced that are much softer and fit better. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"If you like really nice soft bed sheets, these are not for you! They look really nice but even after several washes they're absolutely normal sheets. The 600 Thread count means nothing in this situation. In fact, it feels tougher than cheap sheets I've bought at Ross before. I guess they're inexpensive (kind of at $49.99) for a reason.

The only way I can describe it is as a lovely and wonderfully romantic movie. You forget that you are watching a movie about two males falling in love and only remember the warm feeling that Rock Haven leaves you with. Superb acting by both Sean Hoagland and Owen Alabado. I definitely recommend this movie to homosexuals and heterosexuals alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a gay Harlequin romance","review":"The setting is beautiful, the two main leads are pretty, but the pacing of this movie is so incredibly slow and the plot is so incredibly predictable (with one exception) as to make it unwatchable. The one exception to the predictability of the plot is that there's no typical romance happy ending, which makes this movie even more unsatisfying. I'm really surprised this movie was made in 2007 as you'd think there wouldn't be any 18 year old gay boys in California who didn't realize that they could be Christian and gay. I really have to disagree with another reviewer of this movie who said that it was better than Latter Days! Latter Days was a bit predictable too, but at least it had a happy ending and realistic character interactions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important storyline - unbearably bad acting","review":"The acting is unimaginably bad and the brief frontal nudity is gratuitous and could be awkward for some audience members. I almost stopped watching after 10 minutes. I'm glad I watched the whole movie because the theme is important. A theme I've not previously seen explored. I only wish the acting had been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preachy and leaves much to be admired","review":"This film attempts to explore being gay and Christian--coming out, acceptance, and righteousness. As presented, it comes across a tad preachy. The acting leaves a lot to be admired (or perhaps the storyline was too contrived to bring to life). Either way, I found it fairly unentertaining. If you find this topic interesting, however, you might have the patience to sit through it, which moves at snail speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!","review":"I cannot let you spend money on this movie! Yes, the content is relevant to many homosexuals, but SO MUCH MORE could have been done with this movie - like scenes that actually last for more than 30 seconds!! I can count on one hand the number of scenes that actually last more than 2 minutes. There's not enough time to really invest in any of the characters, which is sad because you should really want to! Character development is seriously lacking in this flick, not to mention character talent! The actors are HORRIBLE! The one positive thing about this movie is the gratuitous nudity in one scene. Otherwise, it was a waste of my money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORINGLY BORING","review":"This movie is one of the worst I've seen recently.

First, if you want to see a movie with the same plot, but better, see Latter Days. It is an interesting movie but is a bit slow. I did not like the ending.

This is a beautiful story! Anna is one of the best characters I've read in a long time. She was brought up privileged but has no sense of entitlement; she's generous, friendly, humble... it is impossible not to love her and the servants agree. Everyone loves Anna - even Rupert. Muriel is deliciously drawn as the villain and Ollie is enchanting. I laughed in a few places and I cried in others. And I even doubted the happy ending at times, especially at the ball. I kept thinking...but this can't be it. It MUST end differently!And it did. The last few pages seemed to rush a bit, but this is easily my favourite read of the year. I couldn't stop turning the pages!Rather than label this YA, I think it's more what I'd call \\"sweet\\" romance and/or fiction for readers 12-90. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS!","review":"I just recently bought a copy of this book after having listened to it on audio for years. I LOVE THIS STORY! It's one of my favorite books of all time. It's a story about a Russian countess who must keep her identity hidden after her family looses everything during the Russian Revolution. She secures a a job as a housemaid for an Englishman's estate. With her zest for life, her willingness to please, and her genuine interest in the lives of others, Anna Grazinsky soon captures the hearts of the inhabitants of Meersham, including the Earl of Westerholme himself, who is in the midst of preparing for his marriage to the golden-haired, blue-eyed goddess, Muriel Hardwick. Completely witty, honest, dignified, vivid and charming, Ibbotson has spun a tale of honor, duty, and friendship, as well as pure, unadulterated love. I definitely put it up there near my four all-time favorites: Anne of Green Gables, Little Women, Pride and Prejudice, and Jane Eyre =). Highly recommend!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little character development and world building","review":"Beautiful writing. I would've wished for a bit more character development as the reader doesn't really get a glimpse into the character's head, motivating factors and what really makes her keep her profession secret from her brother.

I felt like the book was a little long - some of the character viewpoints could have been cut, but it was still nice to get a complete picture.Of course, you love the two main characters. Individually, they are each generous and kindhearted. You hear their stories and see how they interact with others and know that they'd be suited to each other. So while it's nice to see them fall in love, it's also a little strange because they spend hardly any time together. The scenes in which they are together are very few.

They seemed like hollow shells of perfection, each having a beautiful face, but with nothing going on inside them. I found that each character didn't seem to have any flaws in there character and I also found that a girl raised to be a countess would not want to or be able to keep up with the constant hard labor of servants to an estate. Many of the characters had a disability of some sort, such as an invalid relative to take care of, or a crippled leg, but these didn't seem to have any effect on how they lived and it didn't seem to effect their minds at all. Although this is listed as a \\"romance\\" type novel, there was no chemistry between the main characters Anna Grazinsky and Rupert, and I didn't believe anything that happened in the last 1/5 of the book.

The author's journal about his travels throughout Guatemala gave this reader a good understanding of how Guatemala, despite its small size, holds several very distincitive cultures, customs and attitiudes. The book primarily focuses on the various cultures and treatment of indigenous Indian populations throughout Guatemala, which is important in understanding why things are the way they are in the country. There is little focus on middle-class life.While the author sometimes lapses into extended periods of criticizing travelers who visit the country (even if it well deserved) I think the book does a very good job of opening the reader up to Guatemalan culture and provides several other reading ideas for those looking to dig deeper into the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Racist","review":"One of the most racist books I have ever read.

I was surprised when I found that about all you really do is manuver your ship from one point to the other. To me the game was no fun at all and a big flop.

In her book Sara can do nothing wrong while everything Eleanore does is questionable and fraught with ulterior motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all Mother's Doing","review":"Very informative, certainly showed another view of Eleanor. While Eleanor may be changed her view of Sara in her (Eleanor's) later years, it apepared to me that the Eleanor we love would not have existed without Sara's influence. I was surprised that Sara has been so much forgotten by history, not that Presidential mothers are often remembered. It lent great insight to Eleanor and FDR also. Certainly Sara was a 'lady' in the very old sense and also a woman who could and did change with the times. I found it enjoyable and would recommend it to anyone with an eye for history, politics and the Roosevelts and well as women of influence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"The book Tattletale, by Charlie Palek, took me right into the jungles of Vietnam. As a child of that era, it gave me a chilling, first hand look at what the young men of my generation experienced, what they felt about our government, the people at home who supported them, and the war protesters who degraded them. It really made me understand in a small way what the veterans of Vietnam suffered, and made me appreciate those brave soldiers.

I picked her up the 2nd day, when my day care lady handed me the shoes and said that they were garbage but cute. I looked at them and the whole seam around the front of the shoes came off. leaving gapping holes.

The first words to come out of my mouth were, \\"At last!\\" This book really explains the thinking behind the design of logos, symbols and icons with a really interesting layout by David La Cava and Julian Bittner. I was so tired of the 'logo' books that list a bunch of pictures without any explanation or step by step process of how the designer came to the final version of the logo and in essence the voice of the company they represent.This book is not only for the design department, it should be included in the library of the brand manager, the marketing director, the small entrepreneur, the CEO, and anyone else who believes a major key to any successful business is the promotion and building of equity in the corporate ID and Brand Voice.

This is the cheapest place I found for this type of barrel.

Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS ADVERTISED","review":"First of all the barrel is not the same as picture. I got it because you couldn't see any writing on the barrel and it looked nice, but when i got it there was writing on it in bright grey letter. also when you put it on the gun the word tippmann is upside down. Second.... amazon, you really should list the bore size, cause this must be the smallest size out there. it took me two shots to get one ball out. unless you use the smallest balls you can find, don't waste your money, i sent mine back and went to my local paintball store and bought a REDZ 2 piece pepperstick.... great barrel and the bore size is one one the biggest you will find at .689. hope this helps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Desire: A Vampire Novel","review":"This book is a really bad pseudo-gothic (and I don't mean goth) romance. Full of characters breathlessly declaring whatever for each other and then declaring it to someone else 2 pages later. I decided about halfway thru I had wasted enough of my life on this book and read the ending. I like vampire romances and actually own quite a few but this one was pretentious, overwritten and dull. Buy \\"Undead and Unwed\\" if you want a light and fun vampire romp. Or buy any of Laurell Hamilton's earlier stuff if you want more serious. But don't buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish this book","review":"This is the first of Ms. Moore's books that I've read and it will surely be my last. I made it to page 60 before I had to stop reading it. Parts of it were like watching Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Dracula movie. I found it difficult to feel anything for the characters. Nor could I truly get a good picture of them. The plot skipped all over the place and I found it hard to follow at some points. I don't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I love supernatural books, but this book. I didn't understand what was going on. Characters were flying every where. Didn't get any time to know anyone and why characters were doing what they were doing. I think the author was trying to be like Anne Rice, but different and it sure did not work in this book.

Frenzetta does create an interesting world which could provide an interesting story but it seems that Calder has lost his pace.One of the major drives in Dead Things was the fetishistic intensity which he sucessfully integrated into the plot. The same intensity is present in this book but the world he created disallows the same integration in to the story. As a result, it comes off as obscessive rather than interesting.I was even more dissapointed by The Twist so while this wasn't as good as I expected, it was still readable. If you're a Calder fan, its worth a read... as long as you find it used.Otherwise Calder needs to give up on the deadly dolly thing until he can make it work again."},{"rating":"1","title":"buying and reschooling ex-racehorses","review":"the book had good information,kept my attention & was easy reading. I was disappointed that it did not cover what I would consider reschooling of ex-racehorses. It was a good introduction to beginning schooling over jumps for horses that are already trained for riding. The book is geared towards people that have a certain level of knowledge and would not necessarily be good for beginner trainers.

I loved \\"Firefly\\" and \\"Serenity\\" and figured this would be pretty good, too. It was! It had a quirky storyline and appealing actors. I would describe it as a \\"sweet\\" movie, one that leaves you smiling when it's over. I would enjoy seeing it again -- if I ever get it back from my daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy with crusts","review":"No Hollywood archetypes or super polished and airbrushed outcomes. This film has all sorts of heart. As Adrienne Shelly put it, \\"it's about people who do the right thing in the end.\\" She wrote characters that are as real as they are quirky and the result is a gritty feel good romantic dramedy that is truly worth seeing. The whole cast is wonderful but I have to say I really enjoyed Andy Griffith's performance. He's the most believable and darling old curmudgeon I've seen on screen in a while (including other characters he's played). If you can't afford to buy it, rent it. If you can afford to buy it, do."},{"rating":"1","title":"still dont have it","review":"Ordered months ago. Didn't know until after purchase it was coming from overseas.

Several actors I like are wasted here, particularly Nathan Filliom and Jeremy Sisto. I'm an independent film fan, but I honestly couldn't wait until it was over... A big disappointment after all the rave reviews. Oh, well. If you loved \\"Thelma & Louise\\" you might like this, but there are plenty of much better films to try first.

I was saddened to watch this woman live her life with no hope. In the end she made the right choice but getting to that choice was strewn with morale filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurdly syrupy and formulaic","review":"One must really be removed from reality to buy into the stereotypical, superficial and rediculously simplistic story of this movie - female co-workers are nice, men a jerks, friends are great...and the main character makes pies! How much more contrived can a movie get...?! Oh, I forgot, the OBGYN takes advantge of the feelings of insecurity casued by his patient's pregnancy and pursues an affair with her.For those desparate to watch Keri Russell - go rent some episodes of 'Felicity'."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIME WASTER","review":"In light of all the positive reviews I feel the need to offer a warning and a dissenting view. The script is poorly written and the direction possibly worse. None of the major caracters is believable and the plot is silly and trite. The film veers without reason or control from attempted drama to seemingly unintended camp. It's impossible to accept the characters as real but, on the other hand, their absurdity isn't really funny. One of the worst movies I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies to date...","review":"Now, I have a wide taste in movies; I'll watch almost anything and find something good about it.Not so for 'Waitress'.I watched the movie because I'm a huge Nathan Fillon fan, and because there were quite a few good reviews for it. In hindsight, I should have stuck with my original reservations that if a movie is based around pies it's either tacky or superficial.The plot is non-existent, the characters are flat and the whole movie is emotionally unsatisfying. I honestly found it hard to sit through the whole movie and finish it. As it was, I took frequent tea breaks to stop myself simply throwing the disk in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame even by chick-flick standards!","review":"I agree with reviewer Lewis Jackman, who says this movie was way overrated just because Adrienne Shelly died before it was released. I could tell within about ten minutes of listening to the inane dialogue that this was going to be disappointing. Keri is soooo beautiful, but neither she nor any of the other characters was believable, except maybe Andy Griffith. (Like, why would beautiful Keri Russell even consider marrying an abusive meathead like Jeremy Sisto's \\"Earl\\"?) Even the passionate love scenes were so exaggerated as to be ridiculous. The film was very anti-men, too -- other than Griffith's character, the men were all either weak, nerdy or abusive. Jeremy Sisto, who was so great in \\"Six Feet Under,\\" is utterly wasted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusual & unexpected","review":"I really didn't care for this movie, though I admit I'm rather traditional in my tastes. The characters were really bizarre & the plot was shallow, all about having affairs and trying to be happy in the moment. The ending made up for some of it, becuase the main character, Jenna, who had hated the thought of having a baby througout the entire movie, finally came to the realization what an incredible gift it was when she first held her daughter in her arms. She also broke off her affair when she realized how much she and her boyfriend could hurt others because of their cheating. The pies Jenna created were also very cute and delicious-looking. :-) The best thing about this movie was Andy Griffith's role, but I was disappointed with how his story was kind of left hanging at the end.I can see how people with a certain stle of humor would enjoy this movie, but it just wasn't anything special to me. I felt the previews were misleading because I really expected more from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, this is trash","review":"There were parts of this movie that could happen in real life, but for entertainment, there were some things that needed major repair. For instance, nobody would've fallen in love with the doctor (he's so forgettable I forgot his name already) and then things started getting predictable when Jenna and the doctor met every time. I wish I had never seen this film....EVER! This is what I get for giving independent films a try....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Puts adultery in an exceedingly positive light; I regretted inviting my 16-year-old daughter to watch it. Very little development of relationships. Andy Griffith is stiff, seems like an actor in a local community playhouse production. Principals are attractive, other than their unfaithfulness to their spouses. Pie theme is cute at first but is overdone (no pun intended). Don't see what the fuss is about this film; I cynically wonder if its accolades were partly due to the tragic death of its director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check, please","review":"If this movie were a pie, I'd probably leave quite a bit of it on my plate. Set in that netherworld that is Hollywood's conception of the Deep South, 'Waitress' mixes up melodrama, comedy, women's empowerment fiction and then slathers on a bit more melodrama. Some of it works, a lot doesn't, especially the trendy up-with-single motherhood message at the end. Does a character like Earl seem like he'd just fade into the background? A more realistic ending would have been shot at a graveyard. There's also some seriously hammy acting brought to you by Cheryl Hines via Mel's Diner. High points are Keri Russell's nicely nuanced performance and Andy Griffith as a cranky patron. Pleasant, but forgettable and overly starchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film but.......","review":"where are the recipes? I saw this film when it was released in May and really enjoyed it. I couldn't wait for the DVD release because I was sure it would contain the recipes for those mouth-watering pies. God, those pies! What a disappointment. A great marketing ploy would have been to release a cookbook companion with the DVD. Oh, well, I guess I'll have to use my imagination (and the pause button on my DVD player) to try and duplicate them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that sweet","review":"This is not a comedy, it's a drama in disguise. If you want FUN, buy another film. If you like Felicity series and are a big FAN of Keri Russel, then go for it!However, if you don't like those corny and dull dramas, step away from it.The story is about a waitress whose life is a living hell: no money, a lousy marriage due to her agressive and heartless husband, an unwanted pregnancy, an affair full of confusion, a depressing job (except for the amazing pies she makes), to begin with...If you want to watch a boring drama, that's your chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LITTLE MOVIE","review":"Watch it. IT'S MAGIC.Okay, this is a movie that's easy to criticize, if you want to attack it.Some of the characters are cliché, and some are caricature archetypes. But if you watch more closely, the identities in play are weaving a subtle tapestry that invites you to ask yourself the question;\\"If magic and possibility are at work in the lives we lead, where would we look to see it?\\".I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"How is it that so many people gave this boring loser of a movie 5 stars!! One star is half a star too many! Listening to Kerri Russell's fake southern accent go in and out was painful...as was watching her character be so responsive to her abusive husband. The only entertaining part was her playful banter with Andy Griffith. Otherwise the movie is terrible, and a complete waste of time. Save it for a better movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Another one of those movies where all the men are stupid or evil. Would go great on Lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Missing Ingredients","review":"Like the pie \\"recipes\\" on the voiceover - three diverse ingredients tossed in together do not make an edible pie, or an easily digested movie. This movie is a combo of Mel's diner in the old Alice TV show, a bunch of skits ala Saturday Night Live, and a handful of stereotypical characters - dreadful abusive husband, curmudgeonly old codger, wisecracking co-worker friends. Add to that the huge \\"ick\\" factor of a pregnant woman having an affair with her ob-gyn, and there you have it, a recipe for a disappointing film.The cavalier way this movie depicts marriage is a shameful. The ob-gyn is supposed to be a nice guy but he's having pity affair with his patient. We get one glimpse of his intern wife in the hospital - why would he cheat on her? Do they have some sort of arrangement?Fans of Keri Russell may be tempted, but are advised to look elsewhere. This movie leaves a bad taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This was a terrible movie. I can't believe I watched the entire thing. It was disjointed and just all over the place. The acting was mediocre at best and I figured out the ending about 15 minutes into it. Skip this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Directorial Mess...","review":"I thought that this movie would be ok... I never expected the quality of Citizen Kane. Not at all, but from beginning to end, this movie was a mess... There are several takes that are totally flat, they never convey the idea that the director was trying to transmit and other takes just didn't make it at all... they became a mystery to solve, with questions we asked ourselves after watching those strange moments: What was this about?? This events happened constantly...The idea of those colorful pies are just trying to get you to an attempted flashback of \\"Like water for Chocolate\\" but in a neon-fantasy way. The house of the waitress looks quite big to try to convince you that she and her husband are kind of tight in money. The direction suffers the whole time, the script feels truncated and all the way to the end, things never got better. I would try to find another alternate selection if you are planning on spending money in this movie wreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Enjoyable Movie","review":"It is very sad that Adrienne Shelley will never get to direct another film. This is a very nice small film that shows promise for a novice director. A young woman with a lousy husband becomes pregnant and is very unhappy about it. Throw in an improbable relationship with her gynacologist and there is the movie. The performances are sweet, the characters are engaging and movie is fun to watch. Something simple can be very satisfying at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"What a great little movie. So good I just went ahead and bought it! Keri Russell is just terrific and her two supporting waitresses are perfection. Love the accents. Being from the south I'm very picky about movies w/ actors attempting a southern accent and killing it. But they were so good in this movie that even though I was laughing at times by their sayings and accents I never felt like we were being made fun of!Also, Nathan Fillion..what a cutie. He delivers perfectly in this. Very underated actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Good!","review":"I am going to have to disagree with some of the reviewers on here who said that only reason this movie has seen success is because of the \\"backstory\\". I didn't even know about Adrienne Shelly's death when I watched the movie. In fact, I just read it today before I started this review.I liked the movie without knowing of her murder. Keri Russell is understated and clever while all the other actors fulfill their roles very well. Well done to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you married to Earl?","review":"This is THE movie for all women who love to bake pies and are married to an Earl! Jenna, played by Kerri Russel, is in a seemingly impossible situation. She is married to an abuser and appears to have no way of escape. Her situation does not prevent her from dreaming of a better life and then she gets pregnant. Dang that Earl! Her willingness to work hard coupled with a little bit of luck guides her through an unwanted pregnancy, an unfortunate affair, a needed divorce, and into a life of purpose as she embraces being a mother and reaches for the stars to make her dreams come true. This is truly a must see movie for all women with a dream whether she is married to an Earl or making it on her own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I waited for this to come out on dvd as it did not play in our local theater.I found it to be disappointing.It had some great moments,but overall it was just a letdown.I rented it,but would not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"SUPURB!!!!

I originally wanted to see it because of the back story of how the writer/actress/director Adrienne Shelly was murdered while still shooting this film, truly sad! So out of fascination of a woman's last works, I felt compelled to rent this movie. I did enjoy this movie a lot and it's girl power feel of finally letting go of a man who isn't good for you and getting what you want when you're ready. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because it isn't smooth all the way through and the ending is a little wacky.

The writing is overly flowerly, stilted and excessively polite. As the author recounted conversations he had with the Initiate and other people, I was left thinking \\"no one talks this way,did they ever\\"? The author says the Initiate instructed him to write in a \\"quaint\\" manner but I found the style lacking in realism, drama and wonder.

The better singers (Lipp and Seefried) can be heard elsewhere to better effect.If you want every Furtwangler recording, this is one. There is another Furtwangler Flute on EMI.

The problem of their satiric and insipid improvisation is obvious in the customized prog pieces \\"Earthrise\\" and \\"Nimrodel\\", but as far as it goes, music is down to earth, and the classic lineup plays for the first time in a fine manner, but still they were not into any concrete fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Classic","review":"Realistically I had forgotten all about this album and band over the years although they were one of my favourites during the 70's.

This is just more sanctimonious blather disguised as impartial scholarship that belittles the great men of a much harder time than ours. Britain's best thinkers, like Wesley, used to help make the world a better place in which to live, whereas the present-day elites' shallow, smirking arrogance perpetrates only self-reinforcing misery for those who fall prey to their humbug. No surprise that other readers find the subject, as (mis-)represented here, difficult to like.

From page 1 Hattersley, sarcastically belittles this great man of faith. After having read many works by other authors about Wesley as well as Wesley's journals and sermons, it is impossible to imagine that this is the same Wesley I have grown to deeply admire. Hattersley writes with an attitude that will be obvious to readers familiar with Wesley's tremendous legacy.

Also,you may have problems with different compilers. This is not uncommon and you may have to do a little research and explore the code to get it to work properly. This isn't really a bad thing. I use Bloodshed's DevC++ and it provided a small extra learning experience in getting some of the programs to run. but if in doubt, use the compiler on the CD.And last but not least, it's not very many books on programming that flow like this one.

I am, of course, a Latter-day Saint, who also has read other materials from this couple, and have studied the lives of the Tanner's, Ed Decker, Fawn Brodie, Dee Jay Nelson, and Walter Martin - all these together seek to discredit the LDS Faith and its people by spreading falsehood, distortion, half-truths, etc. I'm thankful that for those who SERIOUSLY study this book, and the background of the Tanners, that they will come to know the deceptive practices they use in this book and journalistic techniques to lure people to believe that there is something seriously sinister within the LDS Church. Unfortunately, some people will not take the time to truly investigate the Tanner's motives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed","review":"This book is THE anti-Mormon book of all time by perhaps the best-known ex-Mormons. Notwithstanding, it has many flaws. For example, the Tanners criticise Joseph Smith for having made changes to the revelations from the 1833 \\"A book of Commandments\\" and the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. What they ignore is that the Bible, a text that, as Evengelicals, they believe to be inerrant, is replete with prophets editing their revelations and the revelations of other prophets. THis is clear when one reads Jeremiah 36:28-32b; compare the Decalogue (Ten Commandments) of Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5; and compare Jeremiah 52 with 2 Kings 24-25 and Isaiah 36-39 with 2 Kings 18:13-20:19. If Jeremiah, Moses, and Isaiah can do such, why is it so problematic that Joseph Smith did the same thing as previous prophets of the Lord?This is just one brief example of the many flaws as contained in this book.

I became a big fan since then. When I saw The Alarm Greatest Hits Live online, I couldn't resist it to get it. I didn't saw any review. Just saw the list of songs, and with my closed eyes ordered at amazon.I was right, this album gave me pure energy when I listened. Playing all their greatest hits live, I can't resist it. The alarm make me feel that I was in this performance. It came a lot of memories when I was younger, The Alarm still have a lot to give, strong songs that it will prevail forever.

They're much more sexy than the Jordan I'm used to! I don't know about that \\"taste you\\" line which is edging of vulgarity.

This song is the most original song, that I've heard in a very long time. In a time were rap, and bubble gum pop dominate the charts, its very refreshing to hear a song that is so original. Jordan Knight isn't talking 'bout love, the brother is talkin' bout sex, and he delivers it with an honest sincerity. He starts off with a sargent pepperish circuse type beat, then he eases you in with some acapella, which opens into a timbalandish beat. This mixture of beats, makes \\"Give It To You\\" one of the most interesting and upbeat songs this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Set!","review":"This Playmobil forest set is absolutely adorable.

His unprejudicial accounts give the French forces the credit that is long overdue.Of all the books written about Robert Roggers and his Rangers, I would unhesitatingly recommend \\"White Devil\\" as the best of all.It deserves the rating of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great read.","review":"I bought this with hopes that it would provide additional insight into the French and Indian War. While it provided some information, I was disappointed immensely. I had just finished an excellent series by Alan Eckard that was lengthy, detailed, and engaging. The difference between those scholarly efforts and this book were like night and day. Much is glossed over. I found I could easily put this book down after just a few pages of reading.

It was to many to even keep up with and after awhile I just started skimming over them to see if I could get to something interesting. In a book this long there was not enough interesting things to make it worth my while. I was very dissapointed. If you are into names and dates you'll love it. It read like a bad history book to me.

The old fan would not even draw a piece of toilet paper against the vent although it still spun at full speed. The fan was easy to install, is much quieter, and actually exhausts the room for a change. Well worth the money. The only thing I did not like was the quality of the vent cover and the plastic knob used to secure it. The vent is very thin and flimsy and the knob is cheap plastic; I would have expected a bit better quality on these items considering this is a small fan in the $100 - $150 dollar range. These two issues aside I am about to purchase a second one for my own bathroom. I no longer will cheap out on bathroom exhaust fans. All the cheap units do is make noise, spend a few extra bucks and you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Product Design & Noise","review":"Complaint -- dangerous product!I am a handyman. I bought and installed this bath fan for my own home. The wiring connection box has an access opening that is too small to work safely with -- even with my medium-sized hands. And it's too small to wire the connections using tightly fitting safety gloves. So when I wired the connections, my left palm touched the razor sharp and unfiled sheet metal edges of the fan housing, resulting in a one-inch gash on my palm. NuTone product engineers are asleep at the wheel to allow such a hazard to pass through design and production. In addition, it's not quiet despite the claims, especially when I compared it to my $40 cheapo NuTone fan in a basement bath. With this model, I found that the fan motor hums and buzzes. Maybe the design needs to incorporate rubber dampening grommets where the motor is attached to the frame. So for the price, I just may return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good survey","review":"The author does a good job with a tough topic. This is a fairly narrow niche of statistics that combines rigorous math and domain knowledge based heuristics. It is of interest to a small audience with very diverse background. Pure statisticians will probably be dissatisfied with the lack of rigor. People looking for a recipe to follow will probably find the book too theoretical.Given this challenge, the author acquits himself quite well. Very early on, he simply and clearly states the point of factor analysis. We get a good overview of the basic steps, and the options for tackling each one. The general statistical treatment is easy to skip for people who dont' need it, and seems fairly well done for people who do need it.

This however may leave little for the imagination which may be bad for some but I think people are so freaked by this that they refuse to watch it.

I don't think I missed much. Saw V apparently took up where that one left off. The people involved with this franchise would like for me (and others) to somehow sympathize with whackos because they were wronged by our judicial system. They then use the flimsy premise of \\"let's teach people a lesson through mutilation,\\" by doling out their own form of justice. Yawn. I enjoyed the first two films; however by part 3, all I could do was shake my head. There's nothing new here--much less original. It's just the same old routine of \\"let's play a game\\" that involves loss of life--or at least limb. Still, this wasn't as bad as some of the films of this genre.

They try to make the film tie up all the loose ends that they have created in the previous films but failed to do so, only confusing the viewer more. Oh well, all you can do is hope for a good slasher, and I guess thats what we got, but I can say that the first two saws had a great deal of promise.

I thoroughly enjoyed this entry as the story behind detective Hoffman was in-depth and how he aligned himself with Jigsaw; or so we thought. After the revalation in Saw VI of Hoffman writing the letter to Amanda to kill Lynn Dynlon only makes sense that Hoffman wanted the Jigsaw killings to be his own. Hoffman is no Jigsaw and he is more brutal and un-caring, utilizing the games as his own way of enjoying the brutality. Overall, Saw V was great and I definitly recommend this to any Saw fanatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Creative Mechanical Scariness!","review":"Jigsaw is like a mad mechanical scientist who comes up with all kinds of scary contraptions.

The orignal Saw was one of the best horror films i've ever seen. I remember it came out the same weekend the Grudge came out. The Grudge sucked but i loved Saw. Please let Jigsaw rest in piece!

Though gruesome, the ending was predictable. The charm of the SAW franchise is the unpredictable endings and I hope I can be surprised with the next installment.I'm just wondering if there is a difference between the Unrated Collector's Edition (which I own) and the Unrated Director's Cut.

But that's only the beginning.In keeping with tradition, strangers are forced to work together to stay alive in a series of Saw 2-like \\"missions,\\" during which FBI Agent Strahm seeks out Jigsaw's apprentice. Though not as entertaining as previous installments, and certainly not as fast-paced as Saw IV, Saw V proves to be a worthy addition to the Saw series.However, newcomers to the series will find little to indulge in. Even though Saw V is a prequel and a sequel in and of itself for the Saw franchise, it may just be considered another sadistic movie with no solid story for the bloodthirsty moviegoer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw XXV I mean V","review":"Just because you come up with a few new traps does not make the Saw story worth continueing. The main man, Bell, isn't more than a faded memory and he was the one that was truly scary, not a few pieces of metal and wire or some lackey supposedly carrying on in the masters footsteps. Sorry but just like the Jason, Friday the 13th, and Halloween movies, more of the same-o same-o does not mean better. Just like them this series has reached it's plausability threshold, and anything more is just plain sawing for the sake of sawing, gore for the sake of gore. Anyone can think up ways to kill people in painful bloody ways, not everyone can use suspense to create a frightening mood rather that hack one victim up after another for the umpteenth time like mannequins senselessly marching to death. If you like to see the repetitious trapping of people and hacking them up, by all means catch Saw V.

It has good graphics, controls, sound and music. The Graphics are low budget. The controls are a little stiff. The sound is great and so is the environments.Blood Rayne takes place during World War 2. Rayne is half human & half vampire. She has plenty of weapons to use against the evil vampires. Rayne wants revenge against her father for killing her human mother and family. She has a cool attitude and very optimistic. You can kill the enemy a number of ways. Sucking their blood, chopping off limbs with your blades, and shooting them. Plenty of moves to learn. There are boss battles along the way. Some are easy and others are plain tough.The sequel was the best between the two. Blood Rayne 2 had more moves, abilities, weapons, etc. Pick that one instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game!","review":"has a good story.very gothic in a sense.it was my first time i played it after i got it.i liked mainly because the main character is half vampire.i've seen the bloodrayne movies as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this game! NOT RECOMMENDED","review":"For all of the gamers...the game control is difficult to grasp. The graphics are pretty good for the most part. Gameplay is kinda of weak because of how easy it is to just take out opposing characters.Now the core of my review: This game is dark! I've played other games that some would deem pretty creepy. This game traverses the line into extreme GOTHIC. The mind from which this game spawned from is more than likely steep into the occult. I would strongly caution parents away from this game. I would urge anyone considering this game to do so with complete scrutiny. You have to be free of much moral character to appreciate a game this evil.A friend of mine had industry reviews of the game stating that Marilyn Manson had a part in the games development. CAUTION! That it and of itself should be reason to stay clear of this game.Luckily, I rented the game, thinking it held a driven story and fast-action gameplay.

Life vision lets you see where the bad guys are but through walls. You have bullet view, which slows the game down Matrix like and helps you better dodge those annoying nazi bullets.

But he made some serious mistakes. Maybe he should read his references again. Sometimes he takes them out of context completely. Others were contradicting his thesis, but nevertheless he takes them to suport his ideas.Just for example the deep-earthquakes. G. is quoting Frohlich, Scientific American Vol.260, pp.48 as evidence for deep crustal quakes. But he does not even mention the explanation, Frohlich gave for these quakes. There are many more examples.

The science is shifty and sometimes downright incorrect or outdated or taken out of context. The prose is poorly written, taking more rhetorical pointers from Watchtower pamphlets than from, say, Gleick. Ginenthal clearly had a point-of-view before writing the book and the things he excludes is more revealing than what he includes. The impression with which I am left is that those who side with Velikovsky will pick up this book, and those who read only Sagan will be left thinking V was an ill-meaning idiot. If anything, this book just goes to show that those who proclaim that it is a verdict against science or Sagan choose their books according to their views, irrespective of the quality therein, and not based on quality writing, investigating, or balanced presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Candidate for worst book ever written\\"","review":"In only a thousand words??!

Unfortunately, the direction and editing are woeful, particularly in the earlier Civi War battle scenes, and after the long climb up Demon Mountain, there's a real sense of anti-climax. The journey is not helped by this Synergy DVD version, which is technically risible, a dodgy video recording transferred to the digital medium with the usual high degree of sound and picture degradation.

I won't give a summary, though, because the other reviewers took care of that quite well.The characters are all well developed and interesting. As another reviewer noted, the character of Rainald is especially intriguing, being much more complex then he at first appears. And Leo shows several very good traits; humility, respect and politeness (even when it's hard), honesty, and lots of forgiveness. This was hard for him at first, but his character grows, even while he is under the thumb of his conniving and callous Uncle Rolf.

He is not the only living relative, Leo discovers with resentment. He learns of the relative that killed his father, and after finally settling into a home that permeates love, is torn from that comfort when kidnapped by the murderous relative. Chivalry plays a part, as Leo cannot break his honor, and must never return to his grandfather's castle.

This book has been a great aide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Comfort\\" seat","review":"I got this because I go numb down there after a reasonably long ride. This seat solved that problem, but presented another one. The seat is very narrow and the front corners of the seat jab into the sides of my butt. I tried tilting it forward, but I keep slipping off. Also, my weight shifts too much to my arms, and I don't like that. This seat may work with a bike that you can sit upright, but not anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great noseless seat!","review":"After having experimented with several other noseless seats this summer, this one was by far the best. While removing the nose and alleviating pressure in the perineum any seat setup will invariably divert that pressure somewhere else. Most likely people feel it more in their hands, wrists, or shoulders. If you can deal with a little more force there it will be well worth it. What this seat does well is keep the depth(front to back) small enough so as to not bother the upper thighs. Just did a week of riding 20+ miles a day and was more comfortable than I've ever been before on a bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"bicycle seat","review":"Its a seat - but there's no way to attach it to the bicycle frame - took over a week to arrive and it didn't work - very disappointing"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"wish it was softer, but it works.

With that said, I expected this thing to be MUCH wider / bigger .. almost like a cruiser seat but to my surprise.. this was way smaller than your average bicycle seat with horn !I put it on my hybrid style commuter bike and rode a few miles with it.. and it really REALLY hurt... extremely uncomfortable on my 'sit bones' and while I didn't feel nearly as much pressure in the 'taint' area, I felt far more than they advertised.I returned this seat for a full refund and went to my local big box store and got a cruiser seat for $20... much happier!Amazon was pretty great with the shipping/return policy , no complaints there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comfortable seat, worked as promised","review":"I bought this seat to relieve pressure points that were causing numbness on my current seat. Worked great, it was smaller than i thought fromt he pictures, but that is actually a good thing. Getting seat angle and height adjusted just right made the seat go from good to great (and those are individual factors more than properties of this seat, though the adjustment was not one for one with my old seat). The lack of nose didnt seem to affect balance or steering (which is the only reason ive been given for why the seat needs the nose in the first place).I will be buying more of these in the spring for the rest of the family to ride on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"It definitely solves most of the problems that come from having a stick between your legs. However, it's not very comfortable either. The front corners keep ramming into my legs and butt. It also has a weird protrusion in the center that still hits the... 'taint' rather frequently. I ride a mountain bike, btw. I have stuck with it for about a month now, and that doesn't seem to help. I don't think it's a matter of me getting used to it, I think it just has those defects. If you are concerned about the ovrall width, it has about 8in of comfortable sitting space. I would recommend trying something else if you are serious about eliminating the pressure from your genitals.For the designers, I would take a seat that is already known to be comfortable, and just cut out the nose somehow. Most good nosed seats nowadays have a gap in the center for relieving the pressure, and an extra bulge at the back for comfort. This one just seems outdated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me...","review":"I spent some time with this saddle but could not get comfortable with it. I tried all the adjustments. The lack of stability and the additional arm/shoulder pressure were main issues. Some of the other reviews indicate a much more positive assessment. Maybe this is due to individual anatomical differences. Guess I'll try a Selle SMP Men's Trekking Saddle, which is more traditional but offers sensitive area protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise, surprise","review":"After months of disappointment, trying and returning armloads of so-called \\"comfort\\" seats, this Ergo Classic was literally my last stop before giving up on cycling. Let's not mince words, or be cute, guys: The late middle age male prostate does not like the standard bike seat! One ride on this Ergo seat told me that someone had finally got it right. No pain. No other prostate-related symptoms. Yes, other reviewers are correct: It does take a bit of getting used to. But have patience, make small adjustments in seat angle and position, and you will find the effort worth your while. You may even have to adjust your handlebar height or angle a bit. One's center of gravity is shifted forward, and that involves a learning curve, but no more than you'd put into changing from a Crown Vic to a Buick, or vice versa. Its all driving, son, and its not like you're being asked to fly a 747. To the engineers at Ergo: First prize. And the price was painless, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game changer. Revolutionary.","review":"I can't describe how much I love this saddle. It works tremendously on a cruiser or mtn bike / upright position bike. I tried it on my road bike and it doesn't work for that position. But for my mtn position ebike, it's a male-part saver. I feel sorry for those who are in discomfort and can't get around the 'funky' look of this non-traditional saddle. It's sort of one step towards a recumbent saddle, but without needing a new bike. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seat","review":"This seat solved all my chafing/rubbing problems, it replaced the conventional seat on my 1984 Schwinn Varsity.

When I opened the box the seat did not have the mounting bracket that fits over the seat post. I suppose they want me to take my Trek seat apart and hope the brackets on that seat fit this seat.

Whether you consider him to be just a soldier doing his duty or the \\"Butcher of Malmedy\\" you won't find anything better than this. This book covers his entire career from a company commander to his murder by French communists when he was paroled from Landsberg prison.The only problem I have with this book is its price. I feel $95 is a bit much for a 600+ page book which is crammed with over 800 photographs, but I got it as a present so this really wasn't a concern for me. =) As comprehensive as it is, and with probably every photograph of Jochen Peiper in it, I just can't give it 5 start because of that price tag. But if you are a serious student of Jochen Peiper or even the SS in general, this book is certainly worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really unbaised?","review":"Have only reviewed the detailed description of the Battle of Prokhorovka. In that account, Mr. Atge uses and references WWII era German propoganda accounts. The accuracy of these \\"heroic\\" accounts is suspect, the bias of them is clear. The purpose of these accounts were for the glorification of the Waffen SS. While Mr. Atge's work may be extensive, good history does require objectivity and an ability to analyze sources. Mr. Atge does have a social/political agenda that he is pursuing that probably influences his work. Mr. Atge's work should be used with extreme caution and only by people who are already well acquainted with the subject and aware of the biases that are often in these types of works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded expectations, and much cheaper then other options","review":"I use this notebook for meeting minutes and design work on consulting engagements. My previous quad rule notebooks were slightly cheaper (office depot brand), but they were low quality and couldn't hold up to repeatedly being stuffed in a briefcase.The blueline notebook has worked great. Is is a good size carrying to client meetings, and looks professional. The quad rule keeps things neater than the typical legal lined sheet.

I play locally here in a hard rock trio and plan on using this CD as a platform for it's structure. The only downer is the 2 live tracks at the end of the CD.

I look forward to pulling these out of the bag, the weight feels great, they're durable, and at times I'm even able to pull off some spin. Purely accidental of course. I defintely don't take care of my clubs like I should, I launch them towards the golf cart at times so I can pick them up on the way back. And unfortunately I threw my 56 degree a little to hard and smacked the golf cart. I thought for sure it was ruined, but low and behold it survives all of the abuse I give it. GREAT BUY!

Despite this,I am happy with the ring, but I do wish it was more accurately portrayed.Also, the seller should place a ruler or some kind of measure or even a coin next to the ring in photos, so we can compare the size and shape of the ring and stone against a tape measure, ruler, or am everyday item that we're used to.

It has a bright tone, but not a particularly resonant one. The intonation and bridge height required adjustment (and the bridge /is/ adjustable), but other than that it played well out of the box, without needing to adjust the action at the nut. The gig bag is barely adequate ... no padding, a weak zipper, no pockets.My only real beef with this was with the packaging ... although the box showed an instrument with a truss rod cover, and the instrument came with an allen wrench for adjusting a truss rod, the mando in the box had no truss rod. So, in a way, I felt that I didn't get what I ordered.

She gives some interesting insights to the challenges Elizabeth faced as a female monarch and describes how Elizabeth both compensated for her femininity and used it to her advantage during her reign. You will also get a taste of how Elizabethan culture affected the politics of her reign. The book takes an academic approach but is very readable by a layperson.

For instance, she advises to do rooming-in with your multiples even after a c-section. Can a mother get a bit of rest, after major surgery, before she goes home to probably very little sleep. I'm glad that I was able to avoid feeling guilty. After all, my babies are only getting breastmilk.

This new downtempo release is a departure from the Buddha-Lounge series offering a distinctively European flair from well known artists from Sequoia Gooves' other releases as well as several new artists I had never heard before. My favorite tracks are from Eroc & Urs Fuchs entitled Aqua Acclivis as well as David & Steve Gordon's inspiring Guardian Spirit (Club Mix) and Opera to Relax's Soul Spaces the last track on the disc. Steve Gordon has done an exceptional job in fusing the downtempo chillout electonica vibe with a distinctive spirtual flavor that blends the best of the Chillout and World Beat genres into a teriffic ecclectic mix. Your ears will savor the great relaxing international flavors. Really unique & exceptional !"},{"rating":"1","title":"not received this item","review":"I would love to review this item but I have not received it yet.

Who else can combine average lyrics with electronica and make a song that's danceable, sad, and full of meaning? The remixes are OK, but at least the lyrics are included in the Morales and Maddkatt remixes (the 12\\" has 3 extras - Dub, Thee Drum Drum Mix, and Thee 2 Blak Ninja Remix - that are just drums and samples, no lyrics). Hearing this 12\\" only whets my appetite for the CD singles - PSB's B-sides are always a treat!

Plus many others on every aspect of the field.The handgun is not a \\"handsgun.\\" It can be fired more accurately with one hand than with two or three. When beginning, flinching (anticipating the recoil by pushing the gun forward and down) is natural. It can be controlled by spinning the cylinder of a revolver or using a dummy cartridge in an automatic. Then one can see if one is flinching.Practice makes close to perfect. If you are missing what you aim at, adding another hand will not help. As Askins says, it is all in the trigger finger.

What is really freaky in \\"An American Prayer\\" is when he recites poetry about the death OF his c---!This album is deep Morrison. Too deep for the Casey Kasum or Ed Sullivan crowd. So deep that deep thinkers just might get the true meaning of the Morrison lyrics: \\"Words got me the wound, and words will get me well if you believe it.\\"For me, it represents the Fundamentalist's persecution of \\"gays,\\" and the Fundamentalist's promises of \\"Reparative Therapy\\" in those 'ex-gay' ministries!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beatniks Delight!","review":"This is a great Doors CD and so what if they added the music to Morrison's poetry after he died, the result was- in my opinion- one of the best Doors albums ever. It isn't as good as L.A. Woman but it's right up there... as a matter of fact I think they're all pretty dang good. The thing however which seperates this album from the others is the unadulterated, uncensored, deep and moving lyrical content. On 'An American Prayer' Jim's songs are more personal than ever and they give you a good message about his perceptions of life and freedom.Excerpt of \\"Freedom Exists\\"Did you know freedom exists in a school book, Did you know madmen are running are prison, within a jail, within a gaol, within a white free protestant maelstrom.

Jim was honest, not irreverent, when emploring us to \\"look in the mirror\\" as he playfully flashed his reflection in words. \\"American Prayer\\" is an honor to the grand inquisitor. It justly fixes Jim's words with the archetype Doors sound. Let us not forget that, although quite arguably at times pretensious, Jim was a very young man when he died and much moreso when the artiste became. Jim is a friend unknown. A friend whose speech is worth listening to. A man whose vision was beyond his control. A man whose words adeptly convey to us our own precious thoughts and passions. American Prayer is musical homage to Jim's life and being. It's excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY ARE WAITING TO TAKE US INTO THE SEVERED GARDEN..","review":"Do you know how pale and wantom thrillfull comes death on a strange hour, unnannounced, unpplanned for...Like a scaring over friendly guest you've brought to bed.DEATH MAKES ANGELS OF US AND GIVES US WINGS WHERE WE HAD SHOULDERS SMOOTH AS RAVENS CLAWS...No more money, no more fancy dress; this other kingdom is by far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a vegetable law...I will NOT go, prefer a feast of friends to the giant family.This is a beautiful album for both fans and newcomers.When the music is your special friend...R.I.P James Douglas Morrison 1943-1971 Poet and Velvet Menace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The words Live","review":"There are countless volumes of poetry lying on dusty shelves, unread and dying. Because Jim Morrison had the oppourtunity,because of his success, to go into a studio on his birthday with his poems,and a bottle of Irish whiskey , we can enjoy his very provocative take on modern American life the way poems are best enjoyed,in the poets own voice. The surviving Doors did a terrific job with the music and sound effects. I've been listening to this album for years, on and off,and it's always like meeting up with an old friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"No One Here Gets Out Awake","review":"When this record first came out, there were mixed reactions to it. Some regarded this as genius and others were less kind. I personally felt that the record company was trying to make a few extra bucks off of the late Jim Morrison by adding his poetry readings to background music by the surviving members of the Doors. His poetry has a tendency towards being pretentious, vulgar ramblings. When someone ingests as much substance as he did, one could find anything that he said amusing. This is NOT amusing, intelligent, or inspiring. In fact, most of the poetry on this CD is inferior to the material released by the Doors. Explore their other CDs first before you even consider buying this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who's","review":"American Prayer is an interesting album--as much for the jazzy and atmospheric music the band added as for Jim's poetry.

This is the reason they took drugs in the 60s - how else do you make this crap sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Brew","review":"As a spoken word collection, Jim Morrison strips away the trappings of pop culture and truly shows the power of his poetry. In a way, it shows a direction he may have taken in performance art if not for his untimely death.But the concept is ruined by The Doors, who took Morrison's tapes and recorded nothing more than doodlings in Muzak, which sadly makes the end result a parody of the Beat Generation. Ultimately, this is for Morrison fans who are looking to complete their library of authorized releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately NOT the Doors' best work","review":"After learning that Jim Morrison had put out a spoken-word album with music by the Doors before his death, I decided to purchase it, solely on the fact that I enjoyed the piece entitled Ghost Song, which can be found on the Doors' greatest hits album. I had hoped that the remainder of his poetry would be of a similarly spiritual bent. Listening to this CD, however, I was VERY disappointed. Though the words to Ghost Song are included in the accompanying booklet, Ghost Song is the only bright spot on an otherwise confused and strange recording and is the only thing saving it from no stars at all. Much of the poetry included on this album could be considered (and was to me) offensive and not what I was expecting at all. Definately the worst of what the Doors have to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"MYTHS AND DRUGS DON' T MAKE POETRY","review":"Jim Morrison happened to be a self-indulgent drug-addict occasionally making great pop music. As it was, a profetic look and an enormous consume of alcohol and drugs gave people the idea that this man had something very important to say. The myth seriously reached heights when he, luckily, died a poetic death in a tub (probably in a Jesus-on-the-cross-position, with the hands hanging out). Even that some parts of the music on this album are OK, and even if one agrees that \\"Jim's voice is just so captivating\\", one can't survey the poetry which after all this album is all about. And Jim's poetry is pretentious, pathetic, simple, self-indulgent and dated in such a degree, that it embarrass the listener. Recommended for early teenagers that hate their parents in a romantic hippie-manner.Instead of wasting time on Jim, check out THE DOORS."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disgraceful Tribute To A Dead Friend...","review":"When Jim Morrison recorded the poetry for what ended up being the album 'American Prayer' he purposely did not want any of the other members of the band to join him. Jim Morrison and The Doors did NOT record the poetry together but its unfortunate that the remaining members had to go against their dead friends wishes and taint the sanctity of these tracks with ball room jazz and fluff that sound nothing like The Doors. Take what the band did to these recordings and strip them down to the bone and you have a masterpiece. They overproduced, and overedited the sacred works of a dead poet and its a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poet for a Generation","review":"Amazing written word put to great music.

But instead of being a Jim Morrison worshipper, I think that really the whole band was good, which is why the songs worked. Imagine if Morrison had a Strawberry Alarm Clock backing him?How would 'The End' have sounded then?I think Jim was a great singer, able to pull off a sinatra croon or a racous blues. But his lyrics were sometimes interesting and sometimes insipid. This recording is kind of pointless, full of cocaine fueled dribble. The Doors sound okay, they must have wanted to record together again, but this recording is just ghoulish. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to like it more than I do now","review":"First of all, I haven't listened to this album in a long time, but in a weird way, I kind of have. Confused? See, I found a great bootleg online that has the whole poetry session used for this assemblage, and it also includes Jim's last ever recording session (Paris, 1971 with a bunch of not-too-great French hippie session guys) and \\"Orange County Suite\\" before the remaining Doors put all their overdubs on it, about 30 years after the fact. For the curious, its called \\"The Paris Tapes.\\" As for the Doors version of this album, its alright. The Doors described it pretty well when they called it \\"A movie for your ears.\\" The music is carried off well, but I'm not into the whole thing anymore because of the way Jim's words are chopped up.

A team of a medical doctor and a production manager, with others, made this a book I had to have and Amazon filled the bill.I had a recent shipment of Olive Shells from South America that were not in any of the recent publications; but they were in this one!

Make a better album next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Not Authentic","review":"I am Orthodox and I just do not find Tova's books to be authentic, though I can see why secular people love her books. Everyone is a cartoon character, and you never find anything resembling a spiritual journey. Not very well-written either in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"First part - OK, the rest - not so much","review":"I got a good impression of this book by leafing through the first few chapters. It is about two kids: an observant girl becoming more secular and a more secular guy drifing the other way until the two meet. Too bad the good stuff fizzled out. The characters started acting in one-dimensional way right after Tzippy's wedding. Or even earlier, when they came back from Israel. The book should have ended there: the rest feels like a forced and disappointing sequel. The best part was Bryan's family, coping with his teenage rebellion. I read to the end to see what happened to them. Unfortunately, that line wasn't developed much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!","review":"Be careful when considering this product by GPX! It's true it is a good looking, compact stereo and the price is affordable. However the performance leaves a lot to be desired. I ordered two as gifts for my daughters and neither of the CD players worked very well from the beginning (the machines had to be tipped at a 45 degree angle to operate the CD players.) One of them has a malfunctioning tape player, the door fell off, and after only 2 months, neither works with batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound leaves something to be desired","review":"I just returned mine.

But, in this case, looks do NOT count! I got this ONE year after I ordered it...and the sound is all crackly and uneven. The plastic (yes, PLASTIC) cover to the CD broke within half a week, and the speakers got scratched up and full of dust, though I tried cleaning it (WITHIN TWO WEEKS!) So, I suggest you TRY to look at other boomboxes before you buy this one, okay? (...) In my opinion, just stay on the safe side..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget those CD-R's","review":"This player works OK, except with CD-R's, which was one of the reasons I wanted it to begin with.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider another product.","review":"I received this as a gift, so I'm glad I didn't have to shell for this. I am in agreement with the others who say that this product has defects. In my case, it is the radio. I listen to the radio more than I play cassettes or CDs, but it takes a ton of jiggling the settings slider before it will come on and stay on. And forget turning the radio off...then I must start the ritual again. It is very frustrating. The cassette player works well, and the cd player is adequate--not great--but adequate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brewing Up a Business: Adventures in Entrepreneurship from the Founder of Dogfish Head Craft Brewery","review":"As Sam says he is not a numbers guy, he is a sales guy and as such, he has created a book that is essentially a long advertisement for Dogfish Head. The author also admits to having ADD and it shows in the writing. The chapters are unnessary as the book is one long brain-drain. If your looking for a book on entrepreneurship and starting your own business look elsewhere. Beer lovers may find this interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely a WASTE of TIME","review":"This story is nothing more then a rich frat brat branching out on his own for the first time. He has the full support of his rich and successful parents and in-laws who catch him as he fails misaerably and redirects him to success, which he takes full credit for. This is a self promotion book plain and simple. I understand a business represents the owner but this book is over the top.I thought I was spending my money on a good book about crafting beers and building a microbrewery. But instead, it was wasted on a autobiography about Sam Calagione.Take my advice, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel Good Beer for the Feel Good Person","review":"Okay, everyone who has read this loves Sam's beer, its amazing. His beer makes you feel good, and so does the book. The problem is that we readers dont want to feel good, we want to know how to make the stuff that makes you feel good and how to get that feel good stuff to people. I suppose that those tidbits about overcoming bad business blues is important, but I would think that the home brewer already has a penchant for overcoming those obsticals. Anyhow, its more like a coach giving a speach before the big game, not the coaching required to get you prepared for the big game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Wonderful, Just Ask Me!","review":"Sam makes great beer and it's a good thing because he can't write: \\"If an innovative idea was meant to succeed it will, and if it wasn't it won't.\\" Okay Sherlock Holmes, thanks for that groundbreaking insight.Keep in mind three things about this company:1. They, (Yes, a successful company is about more than one person. It's a lot of talented people and team work, but you would never know it listening to P. T. B. Sam.) Dogfish Head, got started when the microbrew craze took off.2. Beer is not rocket science - it's only four ingredients. One of which is water.3. Simple minds always confuse being unconventional with being innovative. That's just snobbishness, which is what all microbrew marketing targets.If you want to read this book, be smart and save your money for beer, get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam Teaches Business","review":"I learned some valuable information from Sam, enjoy his style of writing and anecdotal stories that accompany his life/business lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"Great book and a fantastic read.

The manner in which it is written makes it a quick read and I found myself laughing out loud often. Well written Sam! - John"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off Centered Book","review":"Love the beer but found the book to be more a rambling stream of consciousness that doesn't really have a point. It really seems to be just Sam's rambling thoughts and recollections of his startup. There are some great anecdotes woven through the book (and I'm sure he has plenty that aren't shared). He goes over some of the many questions that any startup should answer but the business advice in the book is fairly basic. At the end of the day I'm not sure what the point of the book really was supposed to be as several subjects are visited repeatedly. It dosen't go into the brewing in any depth and there's certainly not enough substance to call it a business book. If your a really huge fan of the beer you may have some interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable reading with good ideas","review":"While it may not tell you how exactly to make your next million, this book does get your mind rolling on some great ideas for branding and customer service. And who DOESN'T like their beer?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, assuming you have some knowledge of microbrewing","review":"This was an easy to read book, I had a hard time putting it down. I was able to relate to many of the things he mentioned in the book, including the very accurate overview of having and taking advantage of ADD. I would assume that the reader would have to have some interest in the microbrew industry to really enjoy this book, but the advice and experience are applicable to any small business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Business and brewing, 5 stars.","review":"This is a tremendous book for anyone in business, not just the business of brewing. Sam does an excellent job in this book of laying out every step in the process of starting a business. His backround in English makes the book very readible, and he makes his point very clear. The book is filled with great stories and life lessons in business. I have found the book very valuable to me, and am reading it for the second time now. I highly reccomend this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"could i be wrong?","review":"Many of the other reviewers seem to love this book, I don't know why I feel differently. Honestly, after 100 pages I am not sure that I will continue reading. I expected more from an Author who received a college degree in English. I find the book to be humorous but terribly disorganized and repetitive. At times I wondered if I had lost my place and picked up at an earlier chapter in the book. The stories are interesting but I find them to be filled with subjective assessments of consumers. The stories would have been more convincing if some of the consumer insights had quantitative evidence that supported them. Oddly, I found similar issues in a book by the CEO of one of the \\"nameless and faceless\\" companies (\\"Grinding it out\\" by Ray Kroc of McDonalds) that Sam often mentions but I found the book by the faceless organization to be much more engaging. Maybe I just am not off centered enough to appreciate this book. One of these days I will try the beer though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true guitar companion","review":"This book is only for the diehard DMB fans. The intricate details taken to make the parts sound exactly as those on the album is a tremendous step (especially for a band that is known to improvise) and will take much practice in order to master. The five-part guitar for Two Step really shines in this book, even adding parts for the pizzicato violin parts and Tim's intro solos. If you are tired of trying to figure out which way to play \\"Crash Into Me\\" from OLGA (at one time I think I counted ten ways to play it), then this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Matthews Band Mania","review":"Basically Dave Matthews Band has never had anything below excellant.

I don't know who this instructor is, never heard of her before. I picked it up because of the title to be honest. She has nice set of legs for sure but she nor her routine offer any motivation at all to go through her tedious and painfully boring workout. I have 100+ workout videos and can confidently say that you can skip this one and save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like this stand","review":"I received this stand and I was a bit intimidated so I waited over a week before I took it out of the box. I am a 39 year old female and I put this together by myself with a hammer and a screwdriver. I was so proud of myself. It did take a few hours but it was worth it in the end.This City Live TV Stand in Honeydew finish by South Shore Furniture was purchased for my 50\\" plasma and it is perfect.

It comes fully assemblrd, so all you have to do is remove it from it's packaging and let the little one have fun. At 28 inches, it seems to be just right in size for a little one to begin with, not so big that they are overwelmed by it's size, but not so small that it is unskateable.

It is mos def not! I did a little research before buying the album and of course allmusic.com's records were screwed up which isn't surprising.With that said and done, This band 30 Years War is not to shabby.

I listened to it all the way from OKC to Houston recently, and could not bring myself to take it out of the rotation.Donal is a fabulous musician -- his voice hits me where I live, take me where it's dark and sing to me, baby -- but my favorite part of his music is the lyrics. He tells stories that will rip your heart out (4225 Wellington Arms, Promise of a Dream), and seems, somehow, to know what's in the deepest recesses of my heart (Easier, These Are the Days).I just can't tell enough people about this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED!","review":"This was a gift for my son from Santa this morning, only to open it and we are unable to slide the \\"talking box\\" part to the middle of the belt loop. WHY would it not already be attached to it?! Instead, you get them as two seperate pieces and it is completely impossible to slide it through to the middle because of the loops that are to hold the tools. It will not go over those. I am so terribly disappointed. Especially to pay that kind of money, it's a licensed John Deere product, and my son is disappointed on Christmas morning.. what the heck. Do not waste your money.

It caught my eye when looking for moisturizers for a baby with infantile eczema. It was $2.97 in a grocery store:) so I bought it. I am an older white woman so haven't used it on hair- but it is very soothing to irritated skin anywhere, and very safe. It helps seal moisture in skin when applied sparingly after bathing, and then acts as a barrier. Relieves chafed areas, dried areas, itchy places and I use it to remove eye makeup as well. Like the reviewers who use it on hair, a little goes a very long way. The granddaughter with eczema has largely outgrown it, but when babies get colds and snotty noses this Magic applied on a tissue removes nose crusties without tears. It spreads more easily than either ingredient alone.

The voice is very soothing, and the music compliments beautifully. The four tracks offer a nice variety of relaxation processes: body awareness, visualization, breathing focus, positive self-talk.

Most likely they ended up reviewing the wrong listing. There are some AC Adapters listed as \\"Sony PSP AC Adapter by Generic\\" but that fact that this one says \\"by Sony Computer Entertainment\\" means this is the real deal. I ordered it a couple days ago and received it already and it is the exact same packaging you would see in a retail store and the item itself says Sony all over the place. It is solidly built and works exactly as it should.The key when looking at listings for items like this is to pay attention to how it is listed. If it says Sony at the beginning of the title that doesn't necessarily mean it is made by Sony. What you have to look at is the \\"by _____\\" at the end of the listing. As long as it says \\"by Sony,\\" or whatever manufacturer you know makes the original of the item you are looking for, you'll be safe.Amazon doesn't try to trick people, you just have to know what you're doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Charger was as described.","review":"The charger was as described.

The music that G Lee writes is so true to the things that life has to teach all of us that it is difficult to listen to it and not experience your own life and feelings within the words and melodies. This has been my own personal experience with this disc, and I think anyone who truely hears the music that they listen to will feel the same.With great harmonies, sizzling guitar solos, and driving drums and percussion, any true music lover will whole heartedly appreciate this disc. It's really hard to pick favorites (I love them all) but if I had to pick these would be the top 3: Ease Your Mind, Elevated, and Limit. Most of the tunes are upbeat with inspiring lyrics, but others take a look at the darker, more bitter things that life has shown most if not all of us -- a balance of light and dark, kinda like life. 8)I must say this disc is a MUST HAVE for all music lovers!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Check it out!","review":"This is a great first album, with songs that stick in your head.

Many recipies omit quantities, and few of them have been tried in any sort of test kitchen.

Leslie sorts through these questions at home, at school and with her church \\"life group.\\" As you can imagine, these questions don't have easy answers, and the beauty of this book is that it allows the reader to know they aren't alone in their questions, and to also know they are never alone - because God is with them through it all.This book would be great for teens, for parents of teens - to help them appreciate what their teens are thinking about, or for teen youth groups."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good discussion possibilities","review":"KEEPIN' IT REAL is an honest look at a young teenage girl's daily life, and her need for a listening -- and caring -- ear.

She keeps a journal of thoughts. Instead of writing \\"Dear Diary', she writes \\"Dear God\\". Basically she is sorting out the process of becoming an adult. By the end of the school year, she is adapting a positive attitude, understanding that parents are people with their own strengths and weaknesses, and delving into her relationship with God.

She talks to him about her new house, new school, new church group and how frightened she is with all these changes. We read her thoughts as she handles her feelings that a new teacher doesn't care, and that her parents' rules are too crazy. We watch as she shares with God her fear about her parents' pending divorce. We see her mature in her strength in God as she goes through this school year.

Having been familiar with the 70's film with Lee Marvin and Jack Palance, I was interested in watching the differences between the two films. There are minor differences but nothing very radical. In some ways this version is much better than the old one. I really enjoyed the way each film treats the relationship that Monte has with Martine.

The scanner didn't work well at first, but I realized I was scanning at too low of a resolution. Once the settings were adjusted it does a great job. So far I have been very impressed with this machine and would certainly recommend it.

Then the unit started to jam in the transition area consistently failing 50% of the time. Fortunately opening the back and using this secondary discharge allowed the unit to still function. The final straw what when the spring failed holding the upper platened cover. This had always been suspect since the springs are no where stong enough to support this \\"lid\\" but when they failed completely it just gave us the reason to find a better design.

I wanted to know how to modify pilates once pregnant to continue to reap the benefits, and this DVD is pretty good for that. The instructor is very thorough in explaining the moves. I have been surprised by how gentle all pregnancy workouts seem to be, including this one, so that was a surprise but apparently not that unique. The moves shift position frequently from lying to sitting or standing so that is good for the body and baby, although a little bit of a pain to keep arranging everything you'll need (towels and pillows). This DVD also contains Kegel-style exercises, which is a nice feature.

The author describes total war as the expansion of battlefield strategy onto the urban sectors of enemy territory. Total war has two primary effects. Bringing air war tactics to the home front creates both physical and psychological disruption to the enemy's war efforts. Though some of the material can be dry at times, it is necessary information to include in supporting the book's thesis and providing the historical evolution of \`strategic' air warfare. As well, targeting industrialization destroys the enemy's war economy by severing military life lines. Throughout his work, Buckley maintains a focus on a clear thesis. Furthermore, he summarizes his argument through the use of an effective title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Granny","review":"I saw the words Little Tikes and just knew my grand baby would love it...the DVD had been so good.

TOUJOURS PRET"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative book","review":"I chose to read \\"The Stazi\\" in preparation for viewing \\"The Lives of Others\\". The book gave me the background necessary to understand what went on during that period in East Germany and provided insight into the motivations of the people on both sides of the Berlin Wall.Koehler, who was a journalist during the time these events took place, did a commendable job researching what he did not actually experience himself. Lots of statistics and documentation made reading slow at first but the details he provides relative to how spies on both sides are recruited and what they went through and how they did their job made for fascinating reading.I was amazed at the stupidity of the various organizations, including the US military, in not doing a better job of protecting classified documents. In that regard the book was a real eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Insight","review":"This book sat on the shelf for years, I just didn't get around to it until now. I was missing something exceptional. It is a great overview of Stasi operations. It is divided by target. There are sections on internal security, foreign collection by target i.e the US, and West Germany (further divided into sections on politicians, diplomats, military). It shows how the Stasi tried to intimidate their own citizens and how effective they were at collecting on their neighbors (including their Warsaw Pact allies). They were the KGB's loyal attack dog throughout the Cold War. The Stasi were good and had money to spend. The author writes well and the book doesn't read like an academic study. It is full of \\"war stories\\" about HUMINT operations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arms of the Octopus","review":"Although a little encyclopedic and dry at points, Koehler's book appears to be a carefully researched and therefore extremely valuable history of the East German Ministerium Für Staatssicherheit (MfS). Particularly impressive (and new to me) were his descriptions of the psychological oppression in the population resulting from such a vast security apparatus, the extensive \\"outreach programs\\" of the Stasi in foreign countries (Palestine, Yemen, Africa, Cuba, South America - they really were everywhere), and the occasional \\"men of conscience\\" within the Stasi, such as Colonel Rainer Wiegand, who began secretly to fight against the Libyans operating within his own backyard. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Amazing...","review":"It's not the content of this book that is amazing, rather it is that the author has been able to take a subject that is inherently interesting and make it seem more boring than even the dullest textbook. The book is poorly organized, full of editing errors, and lacks any kind of discernable flow. Tedious at best, I found it almost impossible to read more than three or four pages at a time, much less finish it. Many of the glowing reviews on the back of the book are from people who figure in the narrative; the rest have to be from shills who never read it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selective, bland, dull","review":"As an Australian who married an East German who loved her country, I found the book limited in its range, dull in its writing and very selective in its fields and viewpoint.Compared to the paranoia, security, proganda and war-like nature of the current U.S. Of A., there's not much in the book to shock or surprise. Think about the ECHELON network watching our own western lives by our own western states when your read about the STASI methods.Don't expect it to be definitive or unbiased, but it's worth reading. Also keep in mind that we in the west did our best at all times to destroy those countries in every way for 50 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"STASI is A-1 journalism","review":"I was so impressed with STASI that, when I finished reading it, I immediately started reading it again. Of all the books about Cold War history that have emerged since the collapse of the Comrades, STASI is very near the top of the heap. It is a priceless study of the totalitarian evil of the East German police state and the thugs who ran it (One of the most fascinating parts of the book describes Stasi chief Erich Mielke's early history, including his participation in the murder of two Berlin police officers in 1931). Yes, there WAS an Evil Empire and the bad guys lost! I highly recommend STASI--it's outstanding and scholarly journalism that tells an important story, but reads like the best thrillers.

She distorts it all to fit her point of view. I have few doubts she uncovered new evidence to prove that not all was \\"black and white\\", but with her determination to make Anne and her father true saints it just does not read true.And agreeing with an excellent review I read here, to argue that Catherine of Aragon was a shrew (aactually treacherous!) for not accepting her marriage as not valid and her daughter as bastard, right at the beginning of the book, just makes one want to close the book and go do something more interesting.And somehow I also do not believe the idea that Boleyn also married the king in order to bring forth the new religion sticks, not with all that was known about Henry and his court"},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist blather","review":"If you want to read a well thought out scholarly take on Anne Boleyn, stick to Bernard, Ives, or Warnicke.

Because of the complexity of her character, she is indeed my favorite historical character. Yet, while Anne has been terribly maligned, this contrasting view leans far to the extreme in the other direction. Anne was not a saint, nor was she a witch, but this book would have us believe she was an innocent victim of the cold, cruel, calculating tudor court.Anne is a fascinating character because of her multi-faced personality. But, honestly, even when she faced the French sword, she knew that she brought about some of her fate via her own haughtiness and cruelty. Demanding Katherine's jewels, and jealously wanting to slap Mary Tudor's head against a wall are not the marks of a loving person. Anne was cold, coniving and bitterly calculating..not the doe like soul that Denny's book paints.If this is the first book you read about Anne, please put it down, read others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish at best","review":"This is one of the worst biographies I have ever read, and believe me, I have read many.

Without exception the Catholics were portrayed as deceitful, greedy, Godless people, while Anne (who had one of the most unfair trials in the history of law) was a reformer, blameless, saintly....as a biography it was hardly objective. An author has a right to try and cast her subject in a positive light, but not at the expense of others (and of history!).

I no longer even bother with it.Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker S600 Cordless Power Scrubber","review":"I recently purchased this product and it looked great however it took at least ten (10) minutes to get the plastic cut off from around the scrubber. I followed the instructions for charging the batteries (about 16 hours) which seems like a very long time. I put the scrubbing pad on it and in about ten (10) minutes of use the batteries were dead. I am very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely dissappointed.","review":"We had high expectations for this product. It scrubbed very well and did a great job that way, but the mechanism that pushes the liquid cleaning solution was broken when we got the first one. The replacement had a similar problem, so we'll just go back to good old elbow grease. Also, the plastic tab that was supposed to cover the recharge port had a tendency to fall open, not good in a wet enviroment. I'm dissapointed in Black and Decker, it seems this product needed some more real world testing."},{"rating":"2","title":"High expectations met","review":"I am a fan of Black & Decker products so I expected this to work well. We have a rather large tile bath area and this product has cut an hour of hard work down to 20 minutes with minimum effort and better results. Wish I would have discovered this product much earlier. The variety of attachments makes cleaning a breeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrubber - pretty good","review":"We've had the Scum Buster for a few weeks and we think it is pretty good. It has several attachments for different surfaces and a reservoir for cleaning fluid like Tilex. This thing saves a lot of arm work, scrubbing, etc.It is a bit bulky and heavy and your arm gets tired after a while. The bulk prevents you from getting in smaller spaces like a small bathroom sink or behind the toilet. So I think it is pretty good for cleaning floors, shower tile, bathtub and larger spaces. Too bulky for detail work around sink fixtures where you will still need a sponge and paper towels. Any area that can be scrubbed and then easily rinsed like the shower will be the best surface to clean with the Scum Buster.We haven't tried it on upholstery or rugs yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"great until the battery pack dies-can't replace","review":"This worked great for about 2 years. Then it wouldn't hold a charge and found out the battery pack can't be replaced. Wa-hoo...so I have a gadget that has no power...but lots of accessories that I am guessing won't fit on the other models.I wrote to B&D; and they didn't even reply!! NICE! I wouldn't spend 50.00 again....I am looking to see if the other models use the same accessories...but I doubt it. I am tired of products with planned deaths!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The old ScumBuster model is better","review":"I decided to upgrade my old scumbuster with this one and am I sorry I wasted my money.I do not like the fact that you have to plug this one into the wall to charge it. The old one just had you swap out the power cell and you were good to go for another half hour of cleaning.I also dislike the solution dispenser. After using it once, I know I will never use it again. It is awkward and fiddly and messy and takes up too much time. Plus it makes the unit heavier and harder to maneuver.The one feature I do like is the variable speeds, that is a useful thing.The brushes and attachments are not especially new or different or improved from the old unit. The storage case is a joke - it is just the package it came in... what's up with calling it a storage caddy and listing it as a product feature?I would not have bought this if I had to do it over again.Please B&D...; bring back the \\"classic\\" scumbuster - it was better in so many ways!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scum Buster is a Bust!","review":"I had high hopes, but was soon disappointed. Even fully charged and on the high setting, the power is very weak. The low setting is a joke. If you knock the reservoir tube ever so slightly, it springs open. And the attachments fall off easily because there is no real locking mechanism to keep them on--there is only a one inch rotation between \\"lock\\" and \\"unlock.\\" And since you have to apply some pressure because of the weak power, the attachments fall right off. My unit came with a \\"storage case\\" and accessories, but this case is really just the thin, cheap plastic clam-shell packaging everything came in--and which does not truly reclose. I was also disappointed to find that the battery pack is fully enclosed, and therefore not replaceable. Once its rechargeable life is over in a couple of years (if you're lucky), you have to throw the whole thing away. I love the concept, but the actual product does not deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes bathtub cleaning easier","review":"This product made the tub easier to clean and I could tell a difference compared to regular scrubbing. It took a disliked task and made it seem better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly underpowered!","review":"I am genuinely disappointed with this product. I really thought that being made by Black & Decker this product would have some serious power behind it, it doesn't. Also, the attachment that lets the brush heads \\"flex\\" looks in the add like a ball joint, it isn't. It is a hard foam extension that has almost no give to it at all. I can't get into corners like the add promised which is a real shame. It isn't completely useless, but it certainly isn't what the advertisments led me to believe it would be. If I had know what I know now, I would not have wasted my money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"Battery drains quickly. The spinning head stops if you apply even a modest amount of downward pressure when trying to clean a surface. The balance of the device in your hand is awful, it is as bad an ergonomic design / layout for a tool that I have ever used. I do not understand what all these attachments are for, why are they all in there ? I used to have the older model of this which had a higher torque motor, did not have that ridiculous fluid reservoir and last-but-not-least Black and Decker shrunk the diameter of the yellow bristle brush so it does not clean as wide a surface as the older model. I'm guessing this design was done by people in some far away place who have no clue on functionality and ergonomics. Plus, the bean counters figured they could save a dime $0.10 a unit by shrinking the bristle brush head diameter. Overall, a piece of junk. If Amazon would have a lower rating than 1-star I'd give it that but, unfortunately, that option is not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"I've owned 2 of the previous model of Scum Buster and I was looking forward to purchasing this new design. What a disappointment! I put in a water type cleaner and on the second use the nozzle was clogged. To clean it, yu have empty the reservoir, wasting all of the cleaning product that was in it. When taking it apart to clean it, a black piece fell out which didn't show on the diagram of parts so I had no way to know what is was or where it went. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS!I don't know what has happened to Black and Decker, at one time they made quality products but not any more. I bought an electric floor cleaner made by them a couple of months ago which was also a piece of junk.

Was really dissappointed with this replacement. Loved my first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and weak","review":"If you have to scrub a large area that won't be too hard to clean, this is fine. If it's going to take some elbow grease, this just isn't up to the job. It's slow, lacks power, so you can't exert enough force to get off tough messes. Certainly useless for something like a grill. Fine for soap scum."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Battery Life - almost useless","review":"Fully charged this little ditty only runs for 15 minutes, if that. If you use high speed, it runs even less. Even though charged and rarely used, high speed finally stopped working all together.

Try elbow grease and a Mr.Clean Magic scrubber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"I was very excited to get this item, only to be let down. After the lengthy time to let the battery charge, it didn't even last long enough to clean the shower. Even ignoriging the fact that the charge doesn't hold long, I can still clean things quicker with just a little elbow grease and a scrub brush. The case to store it in is the cheap plastice case it came in that won't stay closed.

It saved me time in cleaning the shower, than the small one I was using that was no bigger than a tooth brush. It does not get into tight corners very well, but the thin brush attachment gets into the corners to a point. All in all, it is a good product, and I would recommend it, if nothing else but to save time. The liquid cleaner spray feature, is useless though in my opinion. It seems more convenient to just spray the cleaner solution on, from the bottle it is already in. The holder for the cleaning solution gets in the way at times. That feature could be taken off the scrubber and maybe the scrubber would cost less without it. I am glad I bought the power scrubber though. It beat what I was using."},{"rating":"1","title":"powerscrubber","review":"I was less than impressed.

I don't yet know why.....But: there are very many tracks in number, but of which some lack energy. Some tracks are pure studio tracks, not mixes of a once-studio track. Some compilations contain yet more energy: the interested reader is referred to the \\"Gatecrasher\\" series. So in general I give the compilation four stars - this is probably worth the money if you have enough money to often buy compilations. Also, try to find \\"Love Parade 1998\\", it's better still, \\"Lovestern Galaktika\\" is also good, it's a big party which takes place on the night of \\"Love Parade\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to return","review":"mne arrived with a bad clutch- would not properly tighten or loosen- hard to turn at all.

This may be connected with the latitudinarianism of most Protestant denominations in contrast with the ongoing authoritarianism of Catholicism.

The seat is comfy enough for multi-hour sessions and the steering column isn't wobbly at all.I say if you're looking at this that you should definately get the Buttkicker as well, as the level of immersion offered with both of them is nothing short of awesome.Highly recommended, even with the $299.99 pricetag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"Any serious racing fans must have this playseat. i spent an easy of 2 hours in it without even knowing 2 hours went by.Prior to this it was painful to attach the steering to coffee table and try and play on a low seat and I used to get frustrated by that.

The required allen wrench is provided in the package. I put car wax on all the painted parts before I assembled them, since everything here is prone to rust since it's so humid. The Logitech G25 wheel bolts onto the top via the predrilled holes. Same thing for the pedals. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't sell the separate shifter mount. Otherwise, it's ready for the G25.The only 'con' is that the angle of the steering wheel mount isn't adjustable. The washer at the end of the bolt which secures the mount to the angled piece (the one that's where a car's steering column would be) only allows for one position with the mount being flat.BTW, if you have kids, you have to either put a pillow behind their backs or buy the optional slider accessory from someplace else (Amazon doesn't sell that either) for them to reach the pedals. The seat, as is, can't be adjusted close enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Great! but theres some Flaws..","review":"i ordered from amazon, and got it really fast. thank you amazon people. this playseat evolution is awesome. comfortable, easy to put away. BUT!, you see the black spin knobs? when you tighten them, they create holes, scratches, dents on the bottom pole connecter, they should've put rubber bottoms on the spin knobs or something so it won't damage the product. also they should've add something on the bottom of the metals so it won't scratch your floor. other than that, its a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Design and Easy to shift around","review":"I use it for both my PC and PS3 in my Entertainment room and shift between them easily.

Overall I am satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Very comfortable and can take your gaming to the next level. The wheel mount is stable and secure with very little (if any) wobble. Everything is fully adjustable to suit your most comfortable position. I am about 6'2\\" and have no problems fitting into the seat and there is still length to spare in the foot pedal adjustment. If I may be a harsh critic, the only area which could see improvement is the incorporation of some lateral adjustability in the foot pedal rest. I use an Xbox 360 wheel and the pedals could be slightly more comfortable if they could be moved to the right. The central post supporting the wheel nearly interferes with your right leg when you reach for the brake. Overall, I am very satisfied and will use this product for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome racing setup","review":"For car enthusiasts, this setup is a must! It is well designed, and reasonably solid. For the $240 shipped from Amazon (after discount), this represents a tremendous bargain.

The most powerful acting is in the parts of Gaunt, Mowbray, and Northumberland, who is wonderfully (and appropriately) scary.I recommend this video to help people studying the play get a quick good sense of what is going on in Richard II, and help them over any language difficulties in the written text.I do not think this is a great performance.

In terms of its design and features, everything was great. It had all we wanted at a great price. The only thing I didn't love about this boat was its size. It says its supposed to fit several people, but I didn't find that to be true. My wife and I are short people, but even with just the two of us, we were cramped. When you consider the gear you need to bring for a day of fishing on the lake, there wasn't enough room left for us to comfortably stretch out our legs. Go ahead and get a Sevylor boat, just get the 12' version instead of the 9' version. One more thing.

I would certainly recomend using a 12 V inflator. It takes about 5 min to inflate with a 12 volt pump. A foot pump seems to be inadecuate for the size. It does have alot of little extras like the trolling rod holders. I did make my own motor mount which works great. I put a 30lb thrust trolling motor and it works great in the lakes.

The only way four people could fit in this boat would be if two were floating on the outside and the other two were under 10 years old.

However, after boiling them in hot water to reset it back to the gel like state and wait for it to cool to room temperature, I was disappointed to find out that they crystallized again after cooling and therefore they were useless.

After using it for a whole summer and struggling to keep my shots in a tight group I would not reccomend this \\"upgrade\\". The installation has to be just right for this barrel to even work, and before anyone flames me I used Marbalizer paint and a nitro tank for consistency. My biggest problem however is the lack of speed toward the end of the shots. Sure an extra 50-100 feet of range is nice, but not if your target can literally dodge your paintball. I have been on the recieving end of the flatline at range and it is little more than a joke. I'm midly out of shape but I can still easily dodge the incoming rounds from a flatline at 150-200 feet, or better still stand up and let them bounce off of me.

PROBLEMS WILL OCCUR if it is not. Such as accuracy, distance, and velocity. The paintball most likely will curve right or down. This cuts down on the dictance dramatically. Also, the velocity is greatly affected. I was testing the gun by shooting at a tree 6-7 yards away and sometimes the paintballs would just bounce off the tree(if I actually hit the tree due to the curving there was some degree of difficulty at first). I then put the standard barrel on and the paintballs were more accurate and much faster. The speed of a flatline is like watching a slow motion of a standard berrel, so if you do get this gun crank up your velocity and make sure the breel is lined up coreectly,because this is not a screw in barrel. The barrel is just inserted. There is nothing to keep it from coming out or going out of line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Items","review":"I got my product and it was missing all of the allen wrenches so I still havent put it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great barrel","review":"if you want to have a balanced gun I would recomend a T6 stock and a 20oz CO2 tank also Remember to oil the thread and loosen the screws in the proper order and use an allen wrench to get it all the way in or out.

Usually, I just go down to the local hardware store and pick one up. However, usually after only 1 season, the timer starts to leak and floods the battery compartment, which kills the battery. The timers that I previously bought were made by Melnor Inc. and both broke within the same season I bought them.This time I bought the Orbit timer and spent a little more money (extra $10), but already, I'm glad I did. Not only is it easy to program especially because of the removable programming unit, but it is simply built better than the Melnor timers.Time will only tell if this one will leak too, but I'm optimistic because it seems to be built better and with higher quality parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price!","review":"Like many others, I have tried all the other hose type timers and while some work and some don't, this product has put it all together for quality and convenience.

It just flat refuses find disks and/or tracks unless it is in the right mood. I don't use it much, which is why I haven't done anything about it.

Two weeks later I called and they said, \\"Oh yes, we have your unit. Sorry for the delay.\\" A week later I got the second unit. It worked out of the box, so I tossed the packing materials with the Christmas trash. The day after Christmas, it makes the same gargling sound, and won't play. It seems to be a mechanical problem with the changer, but this unit still has the Denon name on it, and should have been recalled and destroyed. I will never buy another Denon product. The best thing I can say about this CD changer is that it makes a satisfying crunch when struck with a sledge-hammer, and holds down lighter trash in the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little helpful","review":"This book was only a little help.

Maybe it's possible to use this text as a reference, not $100+ textbook to learn from. Looks like the author wrote this book to supplement his own class with a reference, but the world is bigger than his class. Please, whoever bought this book, scan the pages into pdf and distribute it to the internet for free, because this book isn't worth any money.

Second off it simply states and quickly derives complicated structural theories without much introduction or explanation, and provides no application of the theories to actual aircraft. In fact there isn't even a drawing of an aircraft anywhere in the book. Honestly a giant disappointment, and just like my college to make us waste our money on this unintelligible leaflet.

Chock full of theory and derivations, it doesn't set forth a clear path for learning, but rather a thicket in which problems sets are solved by wildly searching backward in the book for equations and examples in order to help make some sense of the problem at hand. While the book is full of good problems, the concepts tested in the problems are not always clearly explained (What the heck is shear flow anyway?).This book is recommended as a junior or senior level structures text, but how well it is received depends highly upon the Professor's lecture style (Straight from the text?(=bad) or supplemental to the text?(=not as bad)).The Bad outweigh the Good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever!!","review":"I am an aerospace engineering student that has to use this book for my structures class.

My TA even told us that we had better come to class every day, because the textbook is pretty much worthless.I wondered why anyone would force students to waste money on a book that is cleary insufficient, but then I recognized the author's name.

The tracks in this recording sound similar and they are not at all interesting. She does wordless songs that I could not bear to listen to and that I had to skip.

Stadler plays extensively on theduplicity of identity: he almost induces a mild vertigoin the process. His eroticism is sincere and the fidelityto place in his descriptions is evocative.Paradoxically, by keeping the self-reflection to a minimum,we learn more about the protag's motivation in this story thanwe ever do in Lolita.

Deep enough to make You understand how and why things are done, creating the urge to experiment with confidence.An important help on first and second steps in the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weekend Handyman and Scubaman","review":"After flipping through all the tile books at the big bookstores and the big home improvement stores, I chose this one and was certainly not disappointed. More detailed and covers a wider range of issues than any other tile book, including the Bridge book, which I bought as well. I figured if I'm spending [a small fortune]on a tile job, what's another [few dollars] to get a few more ideas.I especially liked the chapter where he takes you through a real job, with many of the real world problems one may encounter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting Tile: The Right Way","review":"Mr. Byrne has written dozens of articles in fine Homebuilding and Journal of Light Construction on Tile Setting. The Book is excellent, and walks you through the whole process from tile history, tile design, the various construction aspects of it (e.g., what you have to have underneath the tile to make a good tile job, the various setting beds (old fashioned mortar to newer cement boards), setting the tile, grouting the tile, and finally sealing the tile when necessary.For any person wanting to learn tile setting the correct professional way, this book is essential. I bought it twice, one about 8 years ago, and a second updated version this year because of some new products and resulting new techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just want to install some tile!!!","review":"Reading this book reminds me of asking what time it is and having someone explain to you the history of the watch and how it was made!!! The world of knowledge which Mr. Byrne apparently has amassed about TILE simply does not either impress or interest me. Maybe he should have picked a more descriptive title such as \\"Everything You Could Ever Possibly Want to Know About Tile\\" instead of \\"Setting Tile.\\" I just cant imagine why anyone would want to read all of this detail about tile. (A tile aficianado???) A vast majority of this book is simply unnecessary, and therfore confusing, for a weekend warrior homeowner who \\"Just wants to install some tile.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A good text for people wanting to contract a tiling job, but...","review":"IMHO the author should have gone into more detail on types of membranes and their uses, the need for expansion joints and why, some of the newer products on the market like Schluter Kerdi and Ditra, and self leveling cement and its use for solving particular problems. These I got from pouring through the tiling blogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're gonna tile, you need this book.","review":"Probably the best do it yourself book I've ever used.I was able to do a complex bathroom job (walls, counters, surrounds, patterns, multiple tile sizes) over an inferior floor surface (low grade particle board) by using the advice in this book, and several years later -- not a single problem with the installation.If you're providing the labor, you can afford the essential tools, and this is the #1 essential tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete and realistic for new tilers like me","review":"Great book, gives you an excellent feel for how to figure out what you want to do and how to do it. Assumes minimal experience yet gives enough detail to do a good job, and explains WHY each step is important."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book....","review":"It is remarkable that in the 1990s, in a place as frequently visited as Yellowstone Park, the authors could discover (and rediscover) nearly 300 waterfalls. And some of the discoveries are amazing: 400-foot-high flumes, waterfalls that begin at a cliff-face and disappear thirty feet later, cascades that twist 180 degrees in their descent.The photographs range from adequate to stunning, and the descriptions of locations--complete with UTM grid coordinates--make the guide useful to hikers. A summary description explains the place, type, and height of each waterfall, along with a quick evaluation of the effort involved to find each one. As a result, it's a useful guide for everyone from tourists to car campers to serious trekkers.But the main impact of The Guide to Yellowstone Waterfalls is to reinforce the majesty of Yellowstone Park. Anyone who has spent any time in Yellowstone knows its unique combination of serenity and wierdness: it is a land of oxymorons--and waterfalls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Waterfalls","review":"I love this book. We are going to Yellowstone this fall and I know we can't see all the waterfalls, but we will be able to see some of the ones off the beaten path because of this book. And for the ones we can't get too, we now can at least see a picture and read about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Very consistent album by singer-producer Mr. Jack Knight. I sense a strong Prince/The Artist influence in his voice and style of singing. All the tracks eventually will grow on you although on first listen the songs 'Who do you Love', 'Good Enough' and the killer track of 'em all 'Gigolos Get Lonely Too' will keep you repeatedly hitting that replay button. I say, GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely Disney confection","review":"Water Babies' Circus and Other Stories (Disney Studio) by Georgiana Browne (1940).A collection of short stories. The title story is very, very, very loosely based on Charles Kingsley's 1862 classic The Water-Babies. As in they took the concept but left the plot behind. And while I love Kingsley's version, I still like this one too. Disney is Disney. Pretty much what you'd expect :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"art and love","review":"The only other person who reviewed this book did not care for it; admittedly, it is not like the typical romance novel that dwells mostly on romantic relationships. The main focus was the heroine's development as a musician, and much emphasis was put on her achievement as well as that of her two housemates (also women). Having been a musician in my youth, I found the emphasis on these women's professional growth in an era when women were still mostly expected to become wives to be refreshing. It is not your usual romance novel; the romance is there, but so is the pursuit of personal growth and professional accomplishment. I liked the characters and did not mind taking the time to enjoy the novel. But as they say, de gustibus non disputandum."},{"rating":"1","title":"musical dreams","review":"Diana Ballantyne is purusing the virtually impossible dream of becoming a composer and concert pianist in late 19th century Vienna. She has one year to fulfill this dream before her father calls her back to England and an arranged marriage.Desperately, she tries to find any serious teacher willing to teach a woman but her attempts meet only contempt and ridicule. Finally, fate hands her a chance when she accompanies a friend to play for her singing audition and is taken as a student by Baron Lukas von Korda. Once a brilliant concert pianist himself, he must now turn to composing due to a duelling wound that has rendered his arm useless for playing.Diana spends a frustratingly long book learning about music, nurturing a tentative romance with the Baron, and trying to convince her father that she wants a serious career in music rather than an arranged marriage to a despised fiance. This one just didn't catch my attention and I just hurried through it to get to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gas tank","review":"LOVE IT!!! Excellent stampings and a Perfect fit!!!

Of course, being a collection, it should be just as good as the original, right?Well it's BETTER! For some reason they included 30 strips I'd never seen before. Also, the colors are more vivid in the book than they are on my computer monitor. It's very aesthetically pleasing.They have also included a funny \\"About the authors\\" section in the back of the book, with pictures of the authors rendered in their Cyanide & Happiness art styles.Did i mention it is HILARIOUS???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kris Wilson Ate Every One Of My Children","review":"The creator of Cyanide and Happiness is a filthy sock puppet who destroyed my womb.

My only problem with this book was the amount of comics on each page and the length of the book.It seems as if the publisher could have easily printed nearly three comics on each page, however there is only one per page. It may have been a style they were working on but I like to get more for my money. At the same time, the book is a little short, I found myself finishing it within a few hours, whilst trying to keep my friends from stealing away the book to read it themselves.Its a very popular title, and even with its flaws, it is a GREAT DEAL for around $10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad reflection on our society.","review":"When \\"There is Something About Mary\\" came out, I wondered how much deeper into the dirt we could go. I commented to a friend that perhaps one day we would include rape, incest, abortion, child abuse, pedophilia, family molestation, murder, etc. into our comedy. Well here it is. Am I the only one that finds a comic strip that has a pregnant woman saying she is pregnant then having the boyfriend kick her hard in the stomach and declare \\"problem solved\\" horrific? And we wonder why our next generation of adults are all unsympathetic punks who think it is funny to watch a man in a wheelchair tip over and flail about without thinking at all about helping him out.This is a book of moral desensitization, and a sad reflection of how ugly our society has become. I'd avoid this trash at all cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"LMFAO","review":"I'm amazed it took me so long to discover these guys while everything they do is brilliant! Can't go wrong with this one.

The book itself has many different short comics within, many that would be considered controversial or completely off-base with modern humanity, yet funny to the point that moral feelings can be put to the wayside. The book is of high quality with glossy pages and full color. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone that doesn't mind getting offended from time to time and can take a joke. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CroCop/Silva","review":"This DVD has some extremely exciting fights... the biggest being the main event. Once again, this is a moment in MMA history that is not only worth seeing, but worth having in your collection. This fight not only looks great on paper, but delivers in spades.

John Reynolds has done a great job in maintaining the views of the athletes and participants in ballroom dancing and profiles stars like Marcus & Karen Hilton, the \\"Torvill & Dean\\" of Ballroom/DanceSport. This book will hopefully continue to increase awareness to the general public that Ballroom Dancing is more than a social activity, but an Olympic-recognized sport."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"The book had too many poor photos.

This series of potent meditations come from her own life and the challenges she faced after coming out as a lesbian. Dr Youngdahl remains a Presbyterian minister, and this inspiring book celebrates the humbling power of the Holy, as well as reaches toward an encompassing, feminist vision of spirituality and justice. Even as a non-Christian, I found \\"Subversive Devotions\\" quite inspiring, especially when she addressed how to love in one's own fashion without listening to dominating viewpoints (from whatever direction). An amazing little book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent boombox!!","review":"This boombox is absolutely terrific!

Workmanship was horrible. 1 blade door latch did work. Blade does not flow through center of table, it is very off center and not adjustable. Speed adjustment is a cumbersome 2 person job as it is impossible to tension the belts adequately by pressing down on the motor while securing the retention bolts. Riser installed crooked and not fixable. Blade rubs against return channel (made of plastic.) Descending blade guide poorly manufactured and cumbersome to adjust. Blade guides made of plastic blocks instead of metal wheels. Also arrived in with significant dent in base which chipped off a 1 cm sq of paint. I find myself using my $150 Craftsman bench top band saw whenever possible to avoid using this disappointing yet expensive purchase. The much cheaper Craftsman bench top saw has MUCH higher manufacturing standards.

Some of the areas they have chosen, they may be quite wrong on, such as the value of lowering blood pressure. Other areas they did choose to address have not become major issues because physicians and patients are not as easily duped as they may think.

I hadn't been aware that she had a new release, but I had always been a fan from her early 90's country days. Since I've more recently developed a taste for jazz, swing, and standards, I decided to pick it up. Got it home later that evening, and was absolutely floored! \\"Swing\\" instantly became my favorite CD of the year. The crystal-clarity of Suzy's voice, the pared-down musical accompaniment, the beauty of the older standards such as \\"Comes Love\\" and \\"Do Nothing Till You Hear From Me\\", and the humor of the new \\"soon-to-be standards\\" such as \\"Burning The Toast\\" by April Barrows make this Suzy's best yet by far.

This is what bothers me for this new Guyver series, if you are planning on ressurecting a series, why would you make the same mistake with its trite ending? There is no closure with this series. They ruined it. This was a waste attempt of bringing back the Guyver.

I know this movie had a super low budget but part of the charm of a low budget film is that it makes up for it with good acting and characters and a cool story.

On the bright side, the rest of the young guys they have added to the band really pull it together to bring back all the memories of my youth. Young Jason Bonham really bangs the kit like his Dad, he made UFO's drum parts as clear and loud as I have ever heard them. Great to see him in the band. Vinnie Moore truly amazed me, he is just awesome! He tirelessly riffed out every note perfectly, then tore the house of convention down with his own take on the Solo's. I can't say enough how this guy surprised me, he is a great player. which made this DVD totally worth owning. The only thing is Phil Mogg just can't hang anymore.

The 5.1 digital audio is exceptional. I have noticed that some concert videos in 5.1 do not do justice to the concert sound, but this one has a premium mix. Performances by all band members are flawless, with the non-original members, Bonham and Moore, covering the original parts perfectly while adding their own unique touches. Mogg, Way, and Raymond are, as usual, in perfect form.Disc 2: Live in the studio. Just what you would hope for with this sort of setting. All players in casual studio setting with a super clear video and exceptional audio quality. Small string section sits in on a couple of the cuts, very cool...If you like UFO, you will love this DVD. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"I agree with others that this DVD was long overdue. I'm collecting all the UFO concert footage I can find, and there's not much out there. It's great to see UFO still rocking.Vinnie Moore's performance was amazing and the most surprising part of the set. It's obvious he was having a hell of a good time with the music and it showed.Mogg's voice has aged, but still sounds great. He early starts on a song or two, and changes some of the lyrics around - but I'll cut him some slack cause it's an impressive performance otherwise.While the concert on disk one is great, the studio recordings on disk two is the real gem. I'd love to see some more of these studio videos. Again, Vinnie really shines here.I highly recommend this as the best UFO on DVD, and hope that I can someday watch \\"Stranger in the Night\\" footage done in the same quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The phenomenon continues...","review":"I tend to agree with the previous reviewer, that it would be nice to see/hear some Chapman-era stuff performed instead of the same ole SITN set list. The DVD at 200 minutes is great value. The in-studio set is SUPERB, hearing some ole chestnuts, like Pack It Up and Go and Try Me and of course some additional banter from the boys, although Vinnie seems unprepared. I actually think Vinnie is a good sub for Schenker. The live set is decent but there's too many close-ups and too many cut-away shots, so you feel a bit dizzy by the end (or maybe it was just the cough medicine?), so that's why only 4/5 stars.

It expresses music and sound with more deep and sharp with very sophisticated voices; therefore, each of instruments in orchestra expresses its discrete sounds very cleary. :-) I think that it has huge value with the price. Low price with high quality sounds. :-) I'm also satisfied with the volume control in the headset, especially for the volume level. When I listen to a classical music, i turned on the volume level with 55/100%. It is too loud for me to listen a music over 60/100%.

Does anyone know who we could send a formal complaint too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"The other four Holly Hobbie stories were excellent, my kids adore them.

The animation is not as crisp and clear. The voices for ALL of the characters changed so much my kids got up mid way and stopped watching the DVD. The story line is way off from previous story lines. It lost its warm, happy, helpful theme that was so prevalent in the previous series. If this continues to be the new direction of the series I doubt my wife and I will purchase any more of the Holly Hobbie Adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Movie","review":"The movie was a big let down, the voice talent and animation is a lot lower quality then the original movies, and songs were horrible.Plus the new girl Porcha is a spoiled rich girl who is mean to Carrie and Amy through most of both movies.

Notatall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!","review":"We've thoroughly enjoyed the previous Holly Hobbie shows - good voices, good story, good animation. This DVD isn't anywhere near the quality of the others. They changed all the voices, threw together the animation, weren't true to the heart of the characters or the quality plot lines. Wish I could return it - my 7 years old was so unhappy, and so was I. If this is the direction they are taking the Holly Hobbie shows then I won't purchase anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"want my money back!","review":"My daugher and I just watched this movie and it was bad.

The first cut, \\"In De Back Room,\\" doesn't spring to life like it does on other albums, feeling more determined than lively.The whole album is like that. Sort of a bluesy, sepia toning of some Ray classics.The fourth cut, \\"Blues in De Big Brass Bed\\" is perhaps one of the finest Ray performances on any album. Both sad and passionate, this piece weaves through more than seven minutes of the kind of blues that would make the Hooker proud.There already is a Ray album called \\"Alone With The Blues,\\" but were that name not taken, it might apply here.Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good supplement book","review":"I find this textbook to be a good supplement to the one I use for class (Lehniger).It provides clear & simple understanding of the subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not lie","review":"u said ur book was brand new. but its not. its used...there are scribbles everywhere on the textbook and some pages were folded up weirdly. and the CD was definitely used as well.

It's exactly the same as I remember it on Nickelodeon. As someone said earlier though, this DVD set is just the shows and nothing else like a normal series release would be. But the important thing is the shows are good. The only complaint I have is that...this is not all of season 2! This is actually half of Season 2. I'm hoping they're going to release a second half of season 2, because that's only fair. Still, I must say I've really enjoed the disk, and it was worth the money.

Unless you do decide to release the entire season, this thing needs to have it's cost pushed down to at least $17. Okay, I love Rugrats, I really do but if you're going to release a season set, make sure you release the whole thing. I can say the same thing about Rugrats Season 9 and Doug Season 4 (Which the only thing that made that one \\"Best of\\" is that they didn't add one episode. Yeah, I'm serious).

That's to the creators of Rugrats! The show is of course awesome but only including HALF the season is not! Back when I first bought this item it didn't include \\"Best of\\" at all so I personally was misled... but what is also upsetting is that they didn't just carefully pick the \\"best of\\" season 2.... they just cut them right down the middle!... So it's the exact first half that is only on the dvd, not the second. The second half includes my most favorite episodes!

Most AC voltmeters are sensitive to the AVERAGE value of the waveform, rather than the RMS value, because they assume they're measuring a pure sine wave.

Cool water, hot water, vinegar, needles, nothing worked. Obviously, there is something wrong -- for even the cheapest of perfumes have nozzles that work.

It goes on strong but soon softens to a lovely, undescribable and lightly luscious veil of fragrance. Not sickenly sweet or overly spicy, it seems to just linger enough and folks will ask you what scent you're wearing. I get so many compliments and when I tell them it's Arpege, some youngsters never heard of it.

This one is lovely, with results I want to emulate. As other readers have pointed out, the techniques taught in this book are time-consuming so they should be worthwhile. There is a particularly useful lesson on the value study, sketches that capture a range of tone, using white unpainted paper for white, then light, medium and black tones. I found this to be a great exercise.The book covers more than the pouring technique, with chapters on materials, composition, color among others. When it really gets rolling you can try to repeat her paintings with her step-by-step instructions, or do your own designs.

It was an instant attraction. Since then I have all of their albums (including the compilation RANT & ROAR). \\"Turn\\" now shows up less than a year later with a little bit of a different sound, but still good. It seems as though they are starting to get away from the traditional material to focus more on originals, but that's OK! My favourites are \\"Trois Navires De Ble'\\", \\"Feel It Turn\\" and \\"Consequence Free\\". This could win my esteemed ALBUM OF THE YEAR award, which would mark the second time I've given it to GBS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"GBS is too talented for this. Their previous albums (I have all of them: Canadian & US) were all 5 star efforts. They were witty, powerful, beautiful - simply rare gems. I go to see them whenever they perform nearby.

One of the best things about this cd, and their music in general, is the imagery they present. You almost feel like you know what being a sailor in Newfoundland singing jaunty tunes is like.\\"Turn\\" and \\"Rant and Roar\\" (a kind of best of up until a few years ago) have what I think are their finest moments. \\"Rant and Roar\\" has a better range of their classic Irish tunes (\\"Lukey\\", \\"Mari-Mac\\")whereas \\"Turn\\" has a better mix to old and new.

Please resist the temptation to poke your eyes out. Just turn it off. This movie should be played in film schools everywhere as an example of what no to do. It is so bad that I'm buying a copy so that I can say that I have copy of the world's worst movie. This movie is closer to porn than anything else. But then it would be the Worst Porn Film ever. At least you can follow what's going on in porn. My review..shockingly horrible....a fantastic mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"The first important thing to note, is that this movie was rated X originally by an \\"all-white\\" jury. Anyone that views this movie and thinks it's a movie about porn or sex, has totally missed the entire theme. If you see this movie as a movie revolving around sex,I suggest you watch it a second time because the entire storyline;with all of its creative symbolism, went over your head. In his book,To Die for the People, Huey P. Newton eloquently breaks down the symoblism of this movie and how it relates to society. So, for those who may have trouble understanding the true meaning of this movie, pick up the book to help you through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grade Z home made exploitation-groundbreaking MYAAAASS","review":"I agree with the other ONE STAR raters of this \\"film\\"--Whatever it's intent, cultural timing or underground anti-establishment accolades--the film is TERRIBLE--Terrible in EVERY way--there are no redeeming qualities to speak of--It is a miracle anyone knows anything about this film all these decades later--Great films made during this era have been 90% forgotten, while this is revered--don't get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baadasssss is Bad asss","review":"This movie was revolutionary. Unfortunately it spark the blaxploitation era in cinema, a genre of low budget kill whitey flics, that with their high violence, low budgets, and great soundtracks(minus the political message of Sweetback) began to define an era in cinema when black directors where able to make black movies with black cast in leading roles. Released independently by Melvin Van Peoples in 1971 at a time when blacks in the cinema was next to non-existent (unless they were docile and shuffling their feet). Sweetback tells the story of a man that has had enough of the man and fights back. This movie was revolutionary from its polititcal message to its cinematography. The cinematography of this film which set the president for all other blaxploitation movies to follow was amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Groundbreaking? Maybe. Unwatchable? Definitely.","review":"This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. The direction, camera work, and editing are so awful that I could hardly even tell what was going on. (It's presumably supposed to be trippy and surreal, but instead it's merely annoying and confusing.) The acting is miserable, the script is practically nonexistent, and the music is grating and repetitive. The only thing even remotely worthwhile about the movie is that Melvin Van Peebles as Sweetback look kind of cool when he mugs for the camera. Supposedly this was a groundbreaking movie in its time (1971) because it shows that white society fears a strong black man. A worthy message, perhaps, but this movie certainly doesn't convey it effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst!","review":"This movie stinks. There is little, if any, story. Most of the time is spent watching Van Peebles running down streets, running down alleys, running across roof tops, running on/under/over/across lots of other things. The rest of it is spent with him stopping long enough to screw (not really have sex or make love; screw is the better term) women or kill white men. If a white man had made this movie, there would have been a lot of outrage expressed about how simplistic and low life the bulk of the African Americans portrayed in this poor excuse for a movie were. The only ones who can enjoy this flick are people who need a way to vent their rage, especially anti-white rage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet Sweetback","review":"If you are a fan of the blaxplotation genre, this is a must see film. Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song is the granddaddy that started the whole movement. It was rated \\"X\\" for language and some pretty provocative scenes (for the times) but once you get past all that you'll want to know how Melvin Van Peebles pulled this movie off. Also features the musical score of Earth, Wind, and Fire.The behind the scenes story of the making of this film is even more interesting. Melvin's son Mario, a talented filmmaker as well tells the story in 1993's Baadasssss where he stars as his father.See them both!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Serves To Nauseate","review":"This may be the least watchable film I have ever seen. This was recommended to a friend by Amazon because of our purchases of the comparatively enlightening and morally uplifting Dolemite videos. This movie begins by condoning the statutory rape of a ten year old boy, and descends to new depths of film depravity. The one recurring theme in this film is: RUNNING! YES! How exciting can in get watching Sweet run for what seems like hours. This belongs exactly where we put our copy:in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Melvin Run!!","review":"This is the first Blaxploitation movie and gets a lot of hype because it was released a couple of months before Shaft. So what. It's trash.Superfly, Shaft, any others are better than this. Please don't listen about the people rambling on about the artsy quality of this film. No lighting is no lighting no matter how you cut it. If you want to see Melvin Van Peebles on screen running, literally running, for over 25 minutes of film, in a gold velveteen vest, then buy this movie. This movie is a Melvin egofest. Nothing more. Save 90 minutes of your life and skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Be Rated PT for Pure TRASH!","review":"In a way, this film is hilarious. Director Melvin Van Peebles (and Black Panther head honcho Huey Newton in his book \\"To Die For the People\\") foolishly tried to pass this mess off as a revolutionary flick. In reality, it is straight up pornography with some anti-cop violence thrown in for good measure. What a con job! So male prostitution and killing up the police is supposed to free somebody or make life better for oppressed people? Get real!

I applaude Mr. Melvin Van Peebles right to free speech and expression, but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melvin VS The Man","review":"This is the movie that defined the genre of blaxploitation before The Man decided to bound the genre by making aversion films like SHAFT or SHEBA films. Melvin made a great attempt in the 90's about delimiting true blaxploitation from counter-blaxploitation. A better understanding of his point would be to simply watch SHAFT and then this film (the lines are clear cut)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"A piece of junk. The movie was banned (by an all white jury) and i see why (and i'm black). I think Melvin was full of himself since most of the shots were of him running around town all dressed up in his fly 70's fit. I thought i was going to learn something from this film but instead, what i got was a porno. It was disgusting enough they had a seen that opened up with a very young boy sexin' a grown woman and showing his manhood. I seen a whole lot of manhood in this film (if thats what ya wanna call it..i wasnt impressed). Hopefully the remake will be alot better. This was pure junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vile","review":"I have to tap into my memory banks to recall a more repulsive film. I came up with \\"I Spit On Your Grave\\". Director-star Melvin Van Peebles has the audacity to pawn off his nihilistic fantasies as wish fullfilment for the black population as a whole. There were a lot of artistic triumphs to emerge from so-called \\"black expoitation\\" genre and this is not one of them. This collage of violently misogynistic images can be attributed to the auteur himself. The film starts with Van Peebles exploiting his son Mario by showing the adolescent servicing a prostitute. The film goes downward from there. Van Peebles directorial style is hackneyed and the acting is amateur hour. Don't be fooled into thinking this is some sort of landmark film.

Also, the editing is poor.The drills presented on the video are not bad, but Nick Price, who is the co-star of the video, makes a superfast backswing, not easy to follow for someone trying to copy a movement or correct a mistake.Considering the poor quality of the video and the hard to follow movements, this is not a video that would be much of an advantage for a golf enthusiast trying to improve his swing.Try something else!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"Beautiful addition to my mother-in-law's yard.

I did not see that information anywhere prior to purchase. I have to admit I did not do the whole program -- after 45 minutes I stopped in frustration. Lynne Robinson obviously knows her stuff, but she talks A LOT between exercises, slowing down what is already a nearly movement-free program. (For example, she introduces the Hundred, but spends so much time on modifications that you don't actually get to do the full exercise!) Really a disappointing waste of time, and now I don't have time to do any actual exercise!Although I am not a newcomer to Pilates, I am not in the greatest shape.

The plot and humor are clever and Jon plays Robin Grange well - he makes a devious character quite likeable. If you want to see a lot of Jon, you shouldn't pass on this movie. It took me forever to get through the entire movie because I kept rewinding certain parts where Jon looked especially yummy or said something rather funny.

It's definitely a \\"chick flick\\"; the plot development rests almost solely on the evolving interactions between the characters and there's not a lot of action. Cerebral, I guess you'd call it. If you're into that sort of thing, it's a great flick.

There are typically one or two borderline-excellent stories per issue, while most of the rest have cliched plots, bland writing,and very slow pacing.

When the issue did arrive, I found it was very poor. I think that the publishers of Ellery Queen just don't understand that you have to provide value for the price they are charging.Most the stories were predictable and boring. After the first few pages you can tell where the author is going.I think I am going to use the magazine for recycling, I can't think of reading another copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"EQ Delivers every month!","review":"Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine consistently delivers solid stories every month. As others have noted, not every story is a gem, but I usually find *at least* one really good story per issue, and most of the rest are quite enjoyable. (With around 10 stories per issue, you have to expect the occasional dud.)This has been true for as long as I've been reading the magazine, which must be close to 30 years, now! The quality of the writing is consistently good, because the editors know what they're doing.As a previous reviewer said, it is a good idea to pick up one issue to see if you like the kinds of stories EQ has to offer. But if you like that one issue, you can be sure you will enjoy others.Note: Though it's known as EQ \\"Mystery Magazine\\", not all stories are mysteries. They do all fall generally into the \\"crime\\" category."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparison to the original EQMM","review":"My 80+ year old mother used to enjoy EQMM when I was a kid, so I thought she'd like a subscription for her birthday last year. Wrong! With the very first issue, she started complaining that there was too much bad language and sex in the stories. So I checked it out, and it did seem to be a lot, but no more than what I've come to expect from books, tv, and movies today. For her though, it was understandably racy, and to prove her point she dug out some old EQMM and read some stories. The difference in writing was immediately obvious. The older issues were infinitely better written, with less bad language and no sexual content.I'm not saying it's a bad magazine, but if you're considering this for gift subscription for someone who enjoyed EQMM years ago, be aware that it's not the same as the magazine they used to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"I've been reading EQMM since I was a child and have always enjoyed it.

Many readers do not appreciate the brilliance of the short story form; it's extremely difficult to create a great story populated with multiple identifiable characters, each of whom the reader feels he or she knows and understands. What is truly amazing to me is that the writer accomplishes all of this in a medium of 15 to 20 pages. That takes some serious skill. When I'm waiting for my magazine eah month,I am like a kid waiting for Xmas morning.

That's why its so frustrating. It does, in fact, string beads (up to about six at a time) into hair. However, if you try to string too much hair at a time (more than about 6 strands of hair apparently) the interior gears fall off their tracks and it stops working. I've spent two hours in the two days since I bought this unscrewing it and reassembling the insides. The instructions say you should only use a small amount of hair, but you have no idea how little hair it takes to break this thing. The clasps that come with it are intended to grip larger hair quantities, so if you do use the \\"right\\" amount of hair, they slide right off along with all the beads you just beaded. AAAAARGH!

The clips that come with it are useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Girl Crush Magic Hair Beader Kit","review":"I find that this kit is very educational because it helps persway childrens skills with beading and it helps kids become more independent because if the child is 8yrs old and bought this kit, then they can learn how to use it and gradually be more independent to use it on there own."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to disappoint your child.","review":"Ours broke on the 2nd use!

We finally got everything to stay on the third try. It broke the next time we decided to use it. I took it apart to try to fix the gears but could not get it to work. It looked like something had broken off, but there was no piece inside. I, too, would recommend rubber bands to hold the beads in place since the clasps are just too big.

One word of caution: if you want to connect your Dymo directly to a network through a device such as the HP Jetdirect, you have to purchase a separate parallel cable adaptor.

You can obviously make your Dymo available to other network users as a shared local printer through one of the computers, but it sure would be nice if the parallel cable would be included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Maggie & CL and their friends feel like real people. I've enjoyed every Crusie book I could find (most of them). Crusie makes me laugh and cry - sometimes simultaneously. Part of her gift is to weave together the threads of ordinary lives that - as you get to know the people - become not so ordinary. The mundane and trivial turn out to be the tip of an iceberg of profound inter-relationship(s). Her characters experience moments and make decisions that range from the absurdly ridiculous to a pure-hearted aspiration to the sublime. And - just like for you and me - it can be hard to tell the difference until some time goes by. Crusie relates even deplorable thoughts/feelings with a true compassion for each person's struggle to live a meaningful life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this was going to be a darkly funny novel.","review":"The beginning is witty and I thought it was so good. However, the author wasn't able to maintain the humor and by page 200, the book becomes an overblown category romance. Even has the Harlequin Romance Hero clone, C J. The bad boy turned into Mr. Wonderful Husband Material, great in bed, great with the kid, etc. By the time, the cheating husband is finally killed, it comes as no surprise because that paves the way for the standard happily-ever after romance ending. The focus of the book is uneven. It starts out like a novel, then develops into a romance, with a little mystery thrown in the last third of the book. And, all the characters who've been out of school for at least 20 years, are still re-living their high school days/memories. I wanted to say to them Grow Up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"After seeing this book appear on so many Amazon lists, I decided to pick it up. Unfortunately, I found the characters boring and unlikeable, the plot contrived, the writing clumsy at times, and the humor smart-alecky and unfunny. I almost gave up after the first 25 pages, but decided to continue because I was looking for a fun book. Sadly, this book wasn't very fun because the main character was unbelievable, annoying and unrealistic. Also, you could see almost every plot twist and turn coming a mile a away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I lost interest in book book almost immediately after I started it.

Suspenseful, good plot twists. That was before the boyfriend started talking too much. Am I the only person who noticed that he was a little psychotic? He was obsessively demanding, & she found it endearing! This book could've been great, but I was so irritated by the guy that by the time I was done with it, I hated it. The romance angle seemed so contrived & awkward. It just didn't belong, & even the writing took a nosedive once the romance became a key plotline. This book was a huge disappointment to me, especially after the initial buildup."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Crusie titles!","review":"I have read many of Crusie's books and this one is my favorite. I love the idea of revisiting a high school romance as Maddie and CL do....very sexy! The murder mystery makes things exciting and helps draw CL and Maddie closer. I saw the best friend's secret a mile away, but figuring things like that out is half the fun in Crusie's books. This is a great one. Take this book and Crusie's Welcome to Temptation on your next vacation for fun reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down! (4.5 stars)","review":"I thought this book was a great suspense novel. It was a great mystery about murder, mischief, and adultery. Maddie Faraday finds out her husband is cheating on her, plus C.L, the guy she lost her virginity to in high school, shows up. The events that follow will keep you on the edge of your seat.The only think I didn't like about this book was that it was a little unrealistic.

Only two weeks after Maddie's husband gets killed, she says she loves C.L. and might want to marry him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Novel Even Better","review":"I read 'Crazy for You' by Jennifer Crusie when it first came out in paperback, and I loved it, so I went back out to find her first novel 'Tell Me Lies'. However, I liked her second novel better because there wasn't a kid, like Em, stuck in the middle of a marital dispute.I'm glad that Maddie got out of her relationship with that creep of a husband Brent. I'm also happy that she ended up with C.L. Sturgis, and that Em liked him too. The book made me laugh a lot and I could relate to the small town nucleus where everybody knows everybody else's business. I even liked the story book ending, but I really believe that Crusie did an even better job with 'Crazy for You', which I gave 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Favorites!","review":"There are only a handfull of books that I have found thoroughly enjoyable, and this was one.

I absolutely howled !","review":"Being a murder mystery fan, I had never heard of Jennifer Crusie until I saw the book in my book club magazine and ordered it as a \\"lighthearted\\" diversion before I got into my next thriller. Much to my delight and surprise it actually turned into a mystery but was devastatingly funny at the same time. I do most of my reading at night after my husband goes to sleep and my howling out loud was keeping him awake. I live in a town very much like Frog Point (where EVERYONE knows everyone else's business!) and felt total empathy with the main characters Maddie and Treva. When the book ended I felt a complete sense of loss - like I'd just lost my two best girlfriends. I am thrilled to have found Ms. Crusie and will read ANYTHING she comes up with in this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Silly","review":"I have no idea how this book would get so many glowing reviews? What a waste of time this was. How a wife could find out her husband had an affair and instantly have one her self, it just was silly and stupid.

If that is something you enjoy you will like this book, otherwise don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmm.....","review":".....well I have to say that I was most disappointed with this book compared to Crusie's other FANTASTIC books.If you don't mind the idea of being able to cheat on your other half and morally get away with it because he cheated on you first, you will probably enjoy this book.I for one don't agree with it so I have put this book back on my book shelf and will not read it again.It has not put me off reading any other of her books, as I said before, they are FANTASTIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring And A Waste of Two Hours","review":"I have read some of her other books which I have enjoyed. But this one was so boring it was putting me to sleep. If I had read this one first I wouldn't have read any of her other books.

I guess the people that thought it was funny were sniffing laughing gas because there wasn't anything funny about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not entirely unforgettable","review":"\\"Tell Me Lies\\" was a bit too much romance novelesque for this diehard mystery reader. The plot *had* potential for a decent mystery, but somewhere along the line, Crusie switched gears and made it a novel of relationships. This was disappointing for me, but I still finished it. All in all, \\"Tell Me Lies\\" isn't a particulary challenging, funny or even memorable read, but I'd recommend it as light reading for the plane if you were desperate and there was nothing else available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful","review":"I was laughing within the first 10 minutes of starting this book.

Oh, my. Hold on to your seat, because this is a marvelous rollercoaster of a ride through murder, mayhem, crotchless underwear, great chocolate, and lost love refound.

I continued to read it in hopes that it would get better. The main character, Maddie, was not intelligent and she was so intent on protecting her reputation, she committed crimes!

Anthony takes a common sense approach to the hobby and business of growing these animals. An invaluable guide both for the hobbyist looking for something more than just a pretty picture book. The ideas on alternative tank displays are very good also.

Although, as the author states is not a coffe table book (it has no pictures), is filled with very usefull information and tips. All chapters are based on the author's long experience, which makes the information evermore believable and worth applying. Beyond the basic information, which is very thourough and complete, there are many more in depth discussions, suggestions and experiences, regarding corals and their propagation. Even if the aquarist is not planning in the near future to propagate his own corals (for now!), this book gives you a super solid foundation for successfull reef keeping. In addition, the book is well written and is very pleasant to read. The straight forward style makes for very easy comprehension. By far, the best marine aquarist book I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to run a propagation company in one book","review":"The knowledge that Anthony has packed into this one volume is amazing.

If you take the time to program tracks to play it does a nice job, but if you turn off the power or it goes into standby, you loose your program.

It works great but none of the reviewers mentioned that the display size is too small, too dim to read from 6 feet away so their excellent remote is worthless. the model 600 unit has the same problem. If you think you can sit across even a small room and use the remote and read the display you are in a coma. I have excellent eyes and can't do it nor can any member of my family. I have to get up and go over to the unit with the remote in my hand to find out what disc is playing and what track. Another lauded feature is text display. If you have a CD that has that feature the unit shows the artist etc. Great idea except you cant read it. To make it hurt even more I have 15ish year old 5 disc Sony that has large LED display and it is lit brightly that I have no trouble seeing from 20 feet away.

I'm dumbfounded that are people who would buy this instead of just waiting for the complete set, and I am saddened (though not surprised) that 1) the industry has so little respect for the consumer that they even MADE this set and 2) it will most likely be a profitable move for them.This boxed set is a perfect companion to other well-loved collections such as Star Trek: The Odd-Numbered Films, Star Wars: The Edition Where We Replace Empire Strikes Back with the Ewok Adventure, and the Lord of the Rings: Just the Deleted Scenes.The stupid, it burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente precio y buen set de películas para los seguidores de Harry Potter","review":"El set de películas es una excelente oportunidad para quienes son seguidores de Harry Potter, a un excelente precio en Amazon para quienes quieren adquirir la colección del maguito inglés.

The disc played then started skipping. Replacement- oh no they won't because it's past the 30 days and they won't give you a full refund either.

The only book I've seen that took the time to explain assembly language programming for the 8051 is the one by Scott McKenzie (his chap.8 entitled \\"Program Structure and Design) is worth the price of the book).

When you are going as fast as ever and you let off the gas to make a corner, it decreases your speed by atleast 20-30 mph. I dont like the fact that you cant adjust your car and it doesnt give you money, just the next race to complete. It doesnt have enough cars to choose from, but atleast you can win faster cars, engines, and body styles. The track selection is not very impresive it seems as if they just kept the same track and modified it with inly 2 or 3 different tracks to choose from. It certainly wastnt worth the $50.00.

Yes, the graphics are better and there are more cars and tracks to choose from but this is the same lame game. They really didn't take advantage of the PS2's capabilities.

As others have said, yes, it is pretty, but the gameplay blows. I'm a gamer from the word go, but I couldn't win on the first track in at least 10 tries, the physics are so bad. And if you can't win the first track, you never get to see the rest of the tracks or modes. Control is sketchy, due in no small part to how poorly the developer makes use of the PS2 controller (x button = go, left & right arrows = steering - that's about it - gas is ON or OFF, you're very much just TUUUURNING or your NOT, no finnesse, period - I'd rather play Midtown Madness 2 with my keyboard). The announcer really needs a smack in the mouth, he's so annoying (in his defense, the vapid dialog is what kills the entire voiceover effect).

But you won't need to buy it if you buy Gran Turismo 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun racing game","review":"It's good fun racing, and a change from some of they hyper real racing environments. A really nice video game, in the truest sense of the word.Treat yourself.This is not a game that promises to change the way you spend your life, nor is it 'the greatest visuals, graphics, etc.' but straight forward entertainment, though I have to point out that the graphics are much nicer than many other games'. This will not hurt your eyes, I promise. Have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"Compared to the other racing games avalible for the playstation 2 this one just doesn't match up. Granted it can be fun, but I would look into other games first"},{"rating":"1","title":"not awful, just more of the same","review":"The RR series has always been sort of self-explanatory. Realistic looking cars in a realistic environment, but playing like an arcade racer. No great amount of depth (like the Gran Turismo series) but not quite as cartoony as Beetle Adventure Racing or Top Gear Overdrive.This is just more of the same. Is it the best looking RR ever? Yeah, and it should be, given that its the only PS2 version of the bunch. And, truth be told, it should look better. It does score above-average marks in the style department, but the highly Japanese flavor to it might turn off some gamers. Basically it is what it is: another Ridge Racer game. Type 4 was good for PSX, and a lot of people expected more from this one, but didn't get \\"the next level\\" of RR games, just another in a series.If you want a decent racing game, wait for Gran Turismo 3, or if you've been a RR devotee, then by all means go for this one. For most gamers it's a \\"been there, done that\\" kinda thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Game - Nothing New To The Series","review":"I too own the import of this game and while it certainly has flashy graphics it's very shallow and has nothing significantly different from Ridge 4.One ironic thing is that the first track is the exact same track from the first Ridge Racer game. When you play it you think, \\"Wow, it looks almost exactly the same as the original\\", that's how lackluster the track graphics are.There are also frequent and distracting problems with the game flickering, and the game is nearly impossible to play split screen.I'd recommend Gran Turismo 2000 or Metropolis Street Racer on Dreamcast over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth about Ridge Racer for PS2","review":"This game [is not very good]I own 6 games for PS2 and this is the only game that causes the console to lock-up. Namco will not admit there's a problem. I replaced the CD with another CD and had the same problem. Namco says it's a problem with my console, but no other game has ever locked up.I heard some developers were having problems writing games for the PS2. I'm sure Namco is one of the developers that has had problems.I won't by another game that has the Namco name on it.

I realize this has been the norm for the entire series, but society has moved on (IE: Gran Turismo, Driver, Mario Kart, and the list goes on).Add to the repetition some truly terrible music and a grammatically impaired announcer, and you've got one miserable game. Just getting to a race requires digging through menu after menu...it's a hassle and it's not worth my time.A sad launch game for the PS2. Just sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total waste of time","review":"I got this on the cheap thinking that it would be a decent racing game. I was wrong. I didn't know what to expect, but cars that handle EXTREMELY unrealistically, graphics that are just average in my eyes (compared to NFS 2 Hot pursuit and GT 3) and a general unexpected hardness in gameplay made me sorry I got this game. The cars are fake, which isn't too much of an issue but you have to make the fake cars good. If you're looking for a fun racing game with realistic cars, go for Need For Speed 2: Hot Pursuit, and if you want a good driving sim, go for Gran Turismo 3.

The driving mechanics are bad, I felt it was difficult to race with the vehicles. Drifting is difficult to control at times and the steering can be fustrating.

I was quite disappointed with the level and quality of play with this game. The graphics were great, but the realism of the driving engine is pretty weak: no crash damage, no control feedback, etc. Essentially, a poor representation of driving at speed.The car options are interesting, but not worth the purchase price of the game. To put it simply, I beat the game within a couple of hours of opening it, and I'm not exactly what I would call a particularly skilled game player.

I bought it based on positive reviews and the price - this was a mistake. To begin, the sound is definately not the best - without the bass boost, the sound is similar to the original AM radio my father had in his 1965 GMC pickup, with the bass boost, the sound is sub-par at best. Now the real problem - the anti skip feature simply does not work. When she accelerated to a very light jog, the system started skipping - even if she cradled the player like a bird egg, the thing still skipped. Bottom line: don't buy this one - spend the extra money and buy something with a solid reputation - I've has great luck with my AIWA player for more than a year now - it didn't cost that much more and it has never skipped during a jog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic album by this little-known performer","review":"I purchased this album when it was released back in the late 70s, and it has continued to be one of my favorite albums of all time.

I am trying to think of someone I can compare Ronan to, however off the top of my head the only other artist that makes me feel the same way when I listen to her music is a young Barbra Streisand. His voice is very smooth and rich sounding and hopefully it will only get better with age. I also own a couple of the Boyzone CD's, of which Ronan is a member. I hope he continues with a solo career because it's a shame his voice is hidden amongst other group members. I saw an Elton John interview where he highly praised Ronan. That's about as good as it gets!! The U.S. is definitely ready for more Ronan CD's. Hopefully, with more support in the U.S. the prices of the imports will decrease.

I have since heard Allison Kraus's rendition and not liking C&W very well it did not appeal to me the same way that Ronald Kraus's version did.

You will feel his influence especially in Next to You, which has some similar sounds to Dallas Superstars' Helium.For those who love the well-known Darude sound i recommend Passing By, it's an excellent track, just like Rush (addictive melodic line!) and Drive.Next to You has a dreamy sound and the vocals are lovely.After all, this album has a more sophisticate Finnish sound...In the first part of the tracks, you might wonder when will the boom start...Well, all i can say is : it's always surprising! ;)Spectacular rhythm changes, anthemic melodies, power, style...it's RUSH!...it's D A R U D E !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"This is a truly excellent techno CD.

It seeks to assert that animals lead complex and sophisticated emotional lives, not unlike our own. But it manages to walk the fine line between subjectivity and objectivity. It avoids going too far into the subjective. It doesn't try to emotionally blackmail the viewer with mere cute/stagey displays of animal interaction. Instead it relies heavily on scientific observation in both natural and controlled environments. But by the sheer genious of editing and writing, one cannot help but be drawn into the lives of these noble creatures just as one would a good drama. The movie wisely lets the animals' behavior \\"do the talking\\", and doesn't try to push the viewers' judgement one way or the other.

McCurry is a National Geographic photographer and almost every page in the book could be a cover photo. Many photos of interesting faces from India, Chad, Nepal, Afghanistan, Philippines, China, Mali, Tibet, and (a few of the most interesting) Los Angeles. Small format photos (about 5x7). Photos are printed full page (to each edge of the page) on the right-hand side, and opposite each photo is printed the city, country and year the photo was taken. Photos lack commentary or descriptions and are not categorized, but I found this rather nice. Page turns are often new locations, and the lack of commentary leaves interpretation to the imagination. Just look into the eyes of the subjects and you'll start to feel their story. Great book -- too bad it's so small. It's got a spot on the coffee table nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windows of the soul","review":"This is a wonderful little book.

Quinn is a detective hired to find her and bring her back. Only when he does find her, he realizes everything isn't as he's been told. He finds a strong, courageous woman trying to make a home on the frontier, and he finds that he wants to be a part of it. Their relationship starts in heartbreak and builds trust between the two of them as they face the obstacles of the life they've chosen. This is a really sweet story, with an authentic frontier feel to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cowboy Romance!!","review":"This book was the best cowboy romance that I have read in a long time.

He writes \\"...in these blues as in jazz, the form is determined by time, and by the musician's spontaneous phrasing & harmonizing with the beat of the time as it waves & waves on by in measured choruses.\\" Indeed, the poems are divided into 80 one-page choruses and are quick snapshot-reflections on various details around the poet's everyday living, thinking, imagining, and walking in San Francisco. Some younger people may not readily understand the abstract \\"hipster\\" poetry, but it is obviously a great example of the great visionary poety and writings of Kerouac's world and time. It's a quick read and the reader's appreciation will grow with re-readings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Binding and quality","review":"The content of this book is in line with other books of this type.

Ordinary dictionaries that don't even claim to be etymological gave much better insight into historical and contextual meaning of words than Klein's. I regret buying the book.

And this has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen. Let there be no doubt that the subject is fasicinating. The film follows Googoosh's life and career as well as tackling the role of women in Iran (before and after the revolution). Too bad the director, Zamani, is a complete amateur. This film features a bunch of interview clips that need to be heavily edited to be interesting and it keeps repeating the same archival footage over and over again.The repeated footage, along with the use of the triple-take trick are meant to emphasize the director's point. But the only thing they proved to me was that this filmmaker doesn't know what he's doing. There are so many flaws and cheap cinematic techniques used here that I wouldn't even know where to begin to describe them.This film is an insult to Googoosh and to filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing film","review":"I am very disappointed with the quality of this film. While the film attempts to cover both the life of Googoosh and the historical context of her popularity, it fails enormously!The film lacks a central narrative voice and uses badly edited video clips to make weak points. The film seems to have the quality of a beginner high-school film class student. Please do not buy this film, you would learn more about the life of Googoosh from Wikipedia.There are a few positive film reviews listed here.

The group I watched the film with laughed at the director and his incompetence almost continously. Fortunately, there were no eggs or tomatoes around or they would have been thrown at my TV! It's difficult to make a bad film about a powerful subject like Googoosh. Her story has been woven into the lives of many many Iranians. Kudos to Googoosh for staying away from this amateur filmmaker. Her son should have done the same. The film is ultimately a huge embaressment on so many levels that it does not fit this short review.

It is especially prone to interference from strong stations so if you live in an area of strong reception you'll have a hard time trying to receive distant stations. I had a Panasonic radio like this about 10 years ago and loved it. Reception was much better, probably because it used Toshiba circuitry, which I've found makes a great radio. This model, in comparison is made by Sony instead despite the name on the front. Sound quality is great, providing you can pick up stations. If you live in an area with weak reception this radio will work fine but in case of strong reception I'd recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, HORRENDOUS DVD transfer","review":"Do NOT buy this DVD as the transfer is HORRENDOUS.

It doesn't support rumble for the DualShock 3 and has some horrible load times. It's got a story mode which fans of these rappers would probably enjoy, but to me it's just silly. The main reason I bought the game was for the 2 player versus mode. It has a handful of locations to fight, the graphics are pretty good, and the destruction effects are great. The load times for versus mode are absolutely abysmal, it takes a really long time just to load your rapper at the select screen, and then the level itself takes additional time.I'd say this game is worth $15 or so, it's fun to play with friends, but don't expect much depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"why change the style from def jam fight for ny?","review":"graphics awesome, soundtrack awesome...gameplay...not so awesome. the controls are stupid. they got rid of all the crazy moves that you could do and the game is basically hit as many buttons as possible to win. its very frustrating and boring. no tag team or fatal 4 way either. the game went backwards for improvment except graphics. i suggest buying fight for ny even if you have a ps3 or xbox 360. hopefully if they do a 4th def jam theyll have a way better storyline, more wrestlers etc and bring back the old controls"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not even bother with this one","review":"If you are a fan of the old Def Jam games then do not buy this one.

What I got instead was a pathetic attempt at mixing the button-press-sync games of the late nineties like Parappa the Rapper with a poorly thrown together fighting game. Worst fighting game I've ever played, hands down. The control scheme is lacking any sense or explanation, and the fact that the somehow anthropomorphic environment jumps around and \\"dances\\" to the music in a manner reminiscent of Super Mario makes the game childish...to the point you almost want to give up on the whole \\"adults can like rap too\\" argument. The only cool thing about this game is that once you get used to the repetitive stupidity of the gameplay and manage to learn how to efficiently attack, you can beat the tar out of that annoying T.I. dude.

Though Kozol has undertaken a book on a lofty and worthwhile topic his treatise on poverty in the South Bronx is a disappointing, self-conscious soapbox report, which I liken to a teenager's first person school essay.

Bad job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Content with No Substance","review":"I had the misfortune of having to read this book for a sociology class.

Their abandonment by local government and social institutions should not be surprising to anyone familiar with the area and the issues of national poverty in general. However, the neglect is still shocking.Kozol writes without forcefully pushing personal dogma or accusing nor blaming anyone (mostly), which makes Amazing Grace feel honest and open, allowing the reader to learn and grapple with the heart-wrenching subjects in his or her own capacity. Though it's a shame that his text is just a book and not a solution, at least it's step in a progressive direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars +++","review":"I just happened to notice that Kozol only has an average review of four and a half stars for this book, and I just couldn't live with myself if I didn't add my five.

I have personally visited Mott Haven and I am surprised at how different the area is from Mr. Kozol's description. Crime and murder is not rampant. The Bronx is not some desolate wasteland that stands as a testament of a failed civilization, as Mr. Kozol portrays it as. For those interested, check out (the taft high school website) to see the high school Mr. Kozol continually whines about. You will see that the school is more than decent; its recent debate program with 300+ student participation clearly undermines the false description Mr. Kozol presents. I am saddened by unintelligent atttempt by Mr. Kozol to use sentiment and pity. His inaccurate description is terribly misleading and readers with any shred of intelligence or rationale will not be swayed by this outrageous, fictitious novel.

I guess we should just be thankful that we have this 2-song EP at all, but it leaves you wanting more of Arch's amazing vocals. The winner on this EP is Relentless, one of the best progressive rock songs these ears have heard in quite some time.

After hearing the CD it's hard to believe that he hasn't been singing for 16 years, he sounds that fit. The 2 compositions on this disc are very good; the production is great.

The whole premise that Einstein dismissed his work on orgone energy and the orgone accumulator has now been called into question by new facts about the way the experiments were conducted, not by Einstein, but by his assistant.

Rather than making the twins polar opposites (which is what most actresses whould have done and most twins aren't), she subtlely distinguishes between the two, and her performance at the climax of the movie is very memorable.

If you want to pressure can, this book is much better than the Ball book, which deals mostly with processing food in a boiling water bath. I do agree with those who have said that the format is a bit confusing, but this is a government publication, so what would you expect.The main problem I have with both of these publications is that the yield for the recipes is so far off it was ridiculous. I did the meatless spaghetti sauce from this publication - I can't believe that 30 pounds of tomatoes only yields 5 pints of sauce. I think the book said 9. Learn from my mistake and save yourself lots and lots of time - can your tomatoes whole and then use them later on down the line to make your own sauce.

And the volume was fine. When we got the toy out of the box the volume cut down so low that you can not hear it if the tv is even on in the same room. I changed the batteries and after reading the instructions, it stated that the volume would automatically reduce to lower volume after removed from the box for better enjoyment for children. And it has no other volume control. So unless the house is totally quiet you can not hear what the toy is saying. I am a strong lover of Fisher-Price and expected much better from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flaw: Loud Noise Warning","review":"This item is fun and the LED display is cute.But there is one badly designed play pattern. According to the accompanying manual, you should pretend-play with your infant by putting the phone to your ear and pretend you're having a phone conversation. It also suggests handing the phone over to your infant to also pretend to converse on the phone. That's all fine... except if you do it as the phone is automatically shutting off. When it's in the process of shutting off, the phone will ring. If you then place it next to your ear to pretend to answer it (as I did), you will be greeted with a loud \\"BYE-BYE\\" that is significantly louder than any real phone that I have ever used. I was surprised by its volume and I would not recommend letting kids place the phone to their ears when it says that. (But how will anyone remember when it's safe and when the voice will shout in their ear?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy..You'llbe disappointed!!","review":"We were very disappointed with this phone. In the package it seems great! However when you take out the piece of cardboard on the back of the phone which allows the noises to be audible in the store, you can't hardly hear anything unless the phone is right up to your ear. My daughter got very annoyed with this phone because she would push the buttons and then \\"when nothing happened\\" because she couldn't hear anything she would throw the toy on the floor. My husband tried to jam a piece of paper back into the spot on the back but then my daughter would fixate on it and say \\"Fix it Daddy, fix it\\" . After hearing this over and over again I wanted to pitch the toy. After a year she still hasn't ever really played with it so I gave it away. I suggest the phone my friend has. I think it is endorsed by Parents magazine. It is silver and you can record a message for your child if you want on it.

Only to come home and hear it is exactly like the first phone I purchased barely audible. The kids pick it up and just throw it back down because you have to be totally quiet to hear it. What a disappointment this is!! Some salesperson told me it is very low to protect small childrens ears. What a joke if its not audible no one will ever play with it.

I finally called the company and spoke to someone who informed me that the toy had to be set to a certain decibal. I told her I could barely hear ANYTHING (I had to put my ear up to the phone) and that the sound decreased so much from the time I bought it in the store. Long story short, I believe this item is FALSELY ADVERTISED.

It does not manage to hold my daughter's attention for more than a few minutes. The music is barely audible, which can be a blessing in disguise since the music can get quite irritating. The manufacturers claim that the low volume protects the baby's hearing when held on the ear like a phone(in the original packaging, a thin plastic strip fits a small slit in the back of the toy and increases the volume). But my daughter prefers to look (the few minutes that she is interested) at the lights that flash on the screen instead. It is hard to see kids playing with it as a phone. The toy seems durable, but is very bulky. Overall educational value is low because it does not intrigue my child very much. Look for some other toy for your little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Just like everyone else the volume is way to low.

She picks itup and within seconds she's moved away from it.The concept is cute, but it needs perfecting.

Since the design is more like the modern wireless phones my 16 month old likes to put it on his ear and pretend that he is talking over the phone just like momy. He sometimes puts the phone on my ear so I can play too. Unlike the other phones that have a wire and look like the older phones we used to have this one is best and it teaches numbers, letters and tune songs but note that for 1 button you get 3 letters at once and the tune songs are cut so eventhough the song is longer they cut the song half way...I dont know why but thats that. Overall its okay and my baby likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABC's in telephone clusters","review":"I got this phone because we have the learning home and there was an empty slot for the phone - I know consumerism - but anyway I thought my daughter would like it because she always wants to take the phone when I am talking on it and since it lights up and talks I figured she would leave my phone alone. Well, she likes it but it doesnt hold her attention for too long.The phone says the numbers you press but in ABC mode it says the group of numbers the key represents. Not the best way to learn ABC's but maybe as she gets older and can recognize the letters on the light up screen it will be more meaningful.Otherwise a cute phone - if you press it once and walk away it will ring to remind you to come play - then if it is still ignored it will happily say goodbye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud!","review":"Neat toy, however, the volume is far too loud for a toddler to hold up to their ear.

She's 10 months now and is bored with it. Kind of a frenetic little toy that doesn't do much beyond lighting up and flashing. Push buttons, get noise. A voice says \\"1-2-3.\\" It isn't close enough to a real cell or house phone to encourage phone play; beyond the robot voice saying counting or saying abc's in threes, depending on which # you press, it's not much of an educational toy either.

I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much bang for the buck","review":"I saw a similar Fisher-Price phone which was larger with more features for about the same price in a retail store.

Thanks to all the people who wrote how to adjust the volume if that is a concern.I will say that the phone's volume on our phone was fine - if not a little too loud. I would like it if it sang the entire alphabet, but heh, what do you expect? Our daughter (now 16 months) plays with it occasionally, but it only really keeps their attention for 5 minutes or so (3 stars), I really find that the 3 and 4 year olds like it more.It was an okay buy....I bought it to go along with the house - although it is never with the house *wink*. 4 stars for education because it does say letters, and 4 overall/durability because it has been dropped on hard stone floors, and survives well (and I haven't had to change the batteries since I bought it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Phones Out There!!!","review":"Too quiet!!!

It does look cute in the holder that is built in on the house, but it is not the greatest toy. I understand that the volume is low because of regulations, but I wish it were like most toys that allow you to adjust the volume. You can hear the toy, when there is no other noise in the room. My daughter is 8 months and doesn't know yet to put it to her ear. She does like to watch the letters on the screen.

They all set their sights on boys - Jaime, her old flame Ethan, Ella, her sister's boyfriend, and Beth, her best friend George.Overall, it's a short read that may bring a little enjoyment, but I wouldn't waste money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Boys","review":"This book is awesome!I recommend that everyone read it, well maybe not boys but it's the perfect book to read at the beach.Everyone can relate to it.It's cute, sexy, and hot!!!!and i read it in a day it's that goodu just can't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summer Boring, I mean Boys.","review":"Sure this books a nice light read, looks cute and funny. Some may call it \\"hot\\" but seriously people this book is none of the above. Way to throw girls off with a sexy title, truly, this book is boring. It's really a pointless book that repeats itself constantly, Its all about three girls who are dateing boys, and it's not exciting at all. You really need more conflict in this book. Overall i think this book is stupid. Im sorry if you liked this book, but everyone gets to share their opinion, RIGHT?"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's for the young, but that's it","review":"This was my first teen summer novel. It was a cute and light heart book. As a young teen, it was a great series to read. It has been a while since I last read this book, but from what I can remember, it was predicable for every character. Every girl wants that perfect summer and this definitely gives you that imagination. I would recommend this is young girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite...","review":"This wasnt a very good book in my opinion. I've read hundreds of books and there were only two bad ones: Summer Boys and it's series, Next Summer. Unless your really into short, kinda racy, stories, dont read this one, I just wish someone had told me this before I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flirt-esque Summer Series Story","review":"Four cousins: Kelsie, Beth, Jamie and Ella, always spend their summer at Pebbles Beach. Every summer, the four cousins hook-up with random guys who live around the beach- wierd. This summer, Ella has fallen for a rock-star who happens to be her sister: Kelsie's boyfriend. Beth has somehow fallen in love with her best-friend George and Jamie is ecstatic to be with her boy-friend who she met last summer again.This book was a scary, romantic reality story- which I found disturbing and incomplete. I hated Ella, and half-way through the book I was wishing that she would die. Jamie was so boring, and I couldn't have cared less about her. Beth was pretty okay, I enjoyed her story and I was really sorry for Kelsie for number one: having an idiotic sister and number two: being dumped by her boy-friend. The whole book was so cliche' and totally not my style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"This was a really good first novel, but it could use some improvement. Although the characters are strong and realistic, the plot is unworthy of them. These characters are passionate and thought-provoking, but the plot is just a wham-bam shoot 'em up. There are memorable parts where the author shows what she can really do, like the scenes in the slave markets. The end is dissapointing, the big bad guy is defeated and everyone's problems are solved. As if an empire can be toppled by killing just one person. Hopefully in the author's next book she will allow the characters to use their minds instead of luck and violence. Having said all that, I still give the book a 7, because the charaters do make it worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not buy due to poor discription in product discription","review":"I have been looking for a good noodle rod for calico fishing and thought this may have been the one I wanted; however, no where in your discription do you mention how many eyelets it has.

I have read the book about ten times in the past year. The Revolving Boy stands out as a one of a kind book, that I will always remember. My connection with Derv Nagy is something that can not be explained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point...","review":"...is what the authors needed to do with this painfully extensive book. Having now read the book in its entirety, I can still say that it contains little useful information and the useful information it does have seems to be buried and scattered throughout the book. One problem is that the length of many chapters (one chapter clocks in at roughly 60 pages) make them difficult to read in one setting, if you have a shorter attention span, or for that matter, a life. This could create a problem as stopping in the middle of a chapter and picking back up with it later may be counter-productive. There is lots of good information presented, it would have just been nicer to have it broken down into smaller chunks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one out there??????","review":"I have a great deal of respect for the author. I have a great deal of respect for the contribution he made to the Dominican Order, his integrity and the joy of his faith. However, I was very disappointed in this book and hate to go against the grain. I found the book to be rambling and jumping from topic to topic....I found it difficult to follow the point he was trying to make at times. However, I found his insights on the Eucharist exceptional and one I have carried with me. I do not mean any disrespect, but I found the book difficult to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very very good book","review":"I suggest this book to every good Christian since it helps in strengthening one's faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spice is nice","review":"The only reason I ever bought this cd was for track 3 which is 'Spice'!! All the other tracks I could care less for. I knew I had to have this song the first time I heard it in the club... nice and loud with the heavy bass smoke and lights. This is my favorite old school techno song. It should be rereleased and played at the clubs and raves for the young partiers of today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poorly Made.","review":"The knob that adjusts the lamp head has broken off the studwith the first attempt to tighten it. It was a very poor designin that the stud head was round with two screwdriver like slotsin the head to grip the molded-on plastic knob. Turning the cheapplastic knob just allows it to break free from the shallow slotsand spin freely. There should be a tee bar on top of the stud toengage the knob properly. The other two knobs appear to be the sameway. The people at Designers Edge clearly have never tried usingone of these.On the other hand, the clamp was massively strong, as it should be.Many light clamps are so wimpy they can barely hold the weight of the lamplet alone allow any kind of positioning. Unfortunately, due to the failureof the adjusting knob, I didn't have the pleasure of being able to clampthis light somewhere under the sink or car and not having to dodge itevery 5 minutes when it lets go."},{"rating":"2","title":"International Business","review":"I found Mr. Foster's book to be an insightful analysis of the need for increased cultural sensitivity both in and out of the world of business.

I started to take care of it: no more yanking a comb through it, no more rubber bands on pony tails. I decided never again to cut it, but to grow it forever. The BEAUTIFUL BRAIDS book was intended to help me choose and to achieve \\"styles for every occasion,\\" but it didn't. There weren't complete instructions nor helpful illustrations. Most of the braided styles looked like those a 10-year-old might create. I can do an English braid. I had wanted help with some styles a little more complicated and interesting. I didn't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special!","review":"This book is really not worth the money, most of the styles featured in this book can easily be found on the internet, I am only sorry I did not read all the reviews before buying.

It also has lots of models, examples and exercises to work through. I used this book for a research proposal, and it guided me through the whole thing. The proposal was well accepted.

The product description is unclear...I thought that you could put the headset on and walk around the house talking on the phone with both hands free, but unfortunately, you have to be connected at the base unit while wearing the headset.

I don't know how anybody could describe this as a \\"cordless headset\\" seeing as how the headset has a whopping great cord coming out of it, which needs to be plugged into the phone before it can be used. (Note that it only needs to be plugged into the phone, not into the base unit, so you CAN walk around, if you've clipped the phone onto your belt or something like that.) I'm keeping the phone, because I needed a new one, but I'm not a happy bunny: I feel as though I was conned. A couple of other, minor complaints: (1) the headset only works with the microphone on the left, not on the right; and (2) there's a really stupid flip-panel which performs no function whatsoever except to make it that much more difficult to dial a number. (It can be pulled off, however, with brute force.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"This phone (at least the unit I purchased) had very poor sound quality and range.

F%$&ing awesome. lots of double base and rollsthe best songs are probably the horror cosmic,open casket requiem, and elder misanthropy. the vocals are typical death metal, high and low screams. but by no means a hinderance. if you like any sort of black, death, or doom metal then this is a must have. I also recomend Dying fetus, the agony scene, vital remains, crimson thorn, the old darkthrone stuff(not the black metal), as i lay dying, bloodbath, and behemoths new stuff.I don't know about anyone else but this fred dirst #1 fan is pissin me off."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"Great riffs, great vocals, great everything.

No frills intense speeding thrash with old school grunt-scream-grunt-scream vocals and excellent guitar and drum work. Well produced--not overproduced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gothenberg Metal","review":"Gothenberg influenced by Metalcore at it's finest. Imagine a heavier and faster version The Agony Scene. The vocals remind me of earlier Carcass or Exhumed. A major problem with this CD is that it is WAY TOO SHORT! The band is named after the brutal unsolved slaying of temptress Elizabeth Short. Heavily influenced by Swedish metal and infused with the very brutal sounds of Florida death metal scene, The Black Dahlia Murder's debut release Unhallowed blends the perfect mix of the blast beats, heavy guitars and melody. The Black Dahlia Murder's debut release Unhallowed is definitely a breath of fresh air in a scene that needs a band to lead it in the new direction of metal. Fueled by fierce vocals, blast beats, brutal Swedish influenced thrash, and a few more American-style surprises Unhallowed will not be soon forgotten.

Well, I'll ask this, how many metal bands aren't changing into high punkish vocals? Yeah, thats right, they don't Change. They attack from start to finish and show no mercy whatsoever.

As was the case with the moisturizer, the scrub has not relieved my KP at all. The only positive thing I have to say is that my skin does feel slightly softer after using the scrub. However, to maintain this softness, I have to use the scrub at least 3x a week, which is more than the recommended 1 - 2x a week. I still have KP and after using this tub for approximately 2 months now, it hasn't been worth the money or the promise of eliminating KP. I am very disappointed and truly wanted and expected this product to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I thought this was my answer to my KP, but....it wasn't!it does make my skin a little smoother, but it's not enough to go, ooooh!Don't buy it, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Danielle A","review":"This product is completely AMAZING!!! After I received the product I couldn't wait to try it. It says results usually take about 2-3 weeks to work. I saw results the very first time I used it.

This product took away 80% of my KP, which is amazing and such a relief.I use it every time I take a shower, which is every 1-2 days. After the bumps have disappeared, I only need to use it 2 times a week. It took maybe about 6 weeks to see full results.It was definitely worth trying because my skin is now smooth! I've had it for so long, I figure I would have to deal with it for the rest of my life.It is definitely worth a try if nothing else has worked for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"This did make my skin a lot smoother, but I think that has more to do with the fact that I was using scrub and moisturizer regularly rather than this particular scrub and moisturizer. Using the Bath & Body Works regular scrub and regular body lotion seemed to do just as good of a job. The bumps were just as red as they always have been. When I bought this a few months ago, most of the reviews were so-so. But the dermatologist recommended it to me, so I bought it anyway. I won't buy it again, because it is very expensive and I went through the lotion so fast for how expensive it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different for different people","review":"Worked the first time I used it every day for a week.

This was too hard to like right from the beginning. The premise of why the hero needs the cottage was too far fetched. Just leave the girl alone and go find another solution to your problem. You don't need the money. I just found the hero mean, and didn't want the heroine to like him. Why like somebody that is so nasty from the very beginning. Leave the poor girl alone!Anyway, I gave up after a few chapters because I didn't see anything funny about a mean hero and a sweet heroine that has to tolerate all that nastiness.I did enjoy Barbara Metzgers A Suspicious Affair and Snowdrops and Scandalbroth, and would recommend them, but not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not work!","review":"Did it work?

I couldn't wait to get the DVD to see it on my home theater. Boy was I disappointed. I am not talking about her performance but the quality of the video transfer. It looks as though they filmed the concert off of somebody's TV. The picture is fuzzy and everytime they show her closeup, you can see the scan lines on her face.I have a progressive scan Toshiba DVD player with 55inch Mitsubishi HD ready TV. Watching most DVD movies on it is like watching the actual film, sharp without a hint of scan lines, but not this DVD.

I think the poor management of vocal sound is the principal problem to the detrement of the entire album. Her voice sounds as if it were emanating from a shower stall down and off stage, while the strings, horns and percussion have the up stage sound presence.I presume Ms Brightman has a glorious voice.

You will notice it easily if you compare the difference of the sound between those three and others. Obviously, lip-synched songs sounded very weak lacking \\"her spirit\\". \\"Deliver Me\\" is a clear example. It even made me laugh.(Look at the choir who don't seem like as skillful as Ms. Brightman in lip-synching!) What a disappoinment!!! I don't understand why she chose that way. Maybe she is too old to actually sing many songs in a row before audience without technical support. Ms. Brightman, I don't want to see your appearance, stage manner or dancing.

It is a wonderful remembrance for anyone who was able to experience this breath-taking concert. If you were unable to see her perform live, then this is the next best thing. The DVD version of One Night In Eden is captivating, with its crisp video and crystal clear audio, especially when played in surround sound. You will never get tired of watching this concert.

We were 20 minutes late for our date b/c i had to take all of my eye makeup off to reapply all of my makeup! I've NEVER had to do that before.

On both units, the clock went haywire after the first day. On the second unit, the fm selection went haywire, sometimes working and sometimes not. The idea of a radio/clock for the shower is a good one, but this product does not deliver. It obviously did not work in my shower as directed. The unit was supposed to be water resistent and made for the shower, but it does not work that way! I could understand if I had gotten a defective unit to start, but when the replacement unit did not work as well, I have to be suspect of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wilson Shower Mirror with Radio","review":"Do not buy this item. First it is so heavy that when you hang it in the shower the hooks holding it break (this has happened twice). The mirror is not fogless, the radio reception is horrible and the flourescent light goes very dim after about three uses. The company sent me a 2nd radio after a problem with the first and that one was worse than the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage","review":"This product is completely worthless. The radio reception is dodgy, at best, slips repeatedly, and is not loud enough to be heard over the sound of the shower. The mirror is not fogless, and, worst of all, TURNED BRIGHT BLUE within the first week of use. No kidding, blue. So, I now have a mirrored shower radio and (1) the radio doesn't work, (2) in the shower, and (3) the mirror is useless. This product is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"The only component that works is the radio. The clock is broken and resets itself everytime I try to turn the mirror lights on. I tried to hang it, and the plastic screws supporting the lanyard broke.

I only keep it because my husband got it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my money","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this product. The radio reception is bad, the clock would stop working randomly, and the mirror, not being a fogless mirror, is absolutely pointless in the shower.

The tuner slips onto other station, rust has been leaking out of the non-waterproofed container, and eventually it just stopped working altogether.

I look forward to seeing this movie soon and hearing all these wonderful tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soundtrack that actually is a soundtrack","review":"I really liked the Transamerica soundtrack. Like most people, I usually buy a film's soundtrack after having enjoyed the music in the film. In the past, I've bought soundtracks that don't have any songs that actually featured in the movie. The Transamerica soundtrack had many songs from the film, which was pleasing.I've never really been a country/bluegrass/gospel fan, but I think I might give these genres a try because I really enjoyed the music on this CD. I especially liked the song by Duncan Sheik, \\"I Am A Pilgrim\\", and Dolly Parton's \\"Travilin' Thru\\". I also liked the fact that a number of David Mansfield's score pieces appeared on the CD.All in all, it was a very good CD, and if you liked the movie, you'll definitely like the soundtrack (even if you've never listened to country in your life)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Athalon Everything bag really is everything you need in a ski bag","review":"This is a great ski bag.

I like this part of Tenchi in Tokyo because it is the start of a new series. Also, before watching these episodes, I had never seen Tenchi before.

This model has a lot going for it; the text display is wonderful, it has three settings (bright, dim and dark...dim is best for night) and a battery saver! Here's what I don't like about it...it doesn't remember your last settings when you turn it on and if you mute it, it stays muted from then on...and will not make a sound again unless you unmute or turn it off/on. I would prefer it if it muted for just that one band and automatically started beeping at the next band it picks up. But no one is perfect, I'm happy with the product...pick one up!

The movie completely distorts the events of the Scopes vs. Monkey trial. The evolutionists are given every benefit of wit, intelligance, and sarcasm while the creationists are shown to be ignorant, hypocritical,and narrow minded. Though the movie has some entertainment value, it should be banned from the classroom if for no other reason than that it is completely contaminated with bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title says it all","review":"Though I enjoyed some of the actors in this film in other films. I think this film is biased towards those who believe in evolution.It makes Christians look like idiots, which they are far from, and trys to hammer into the viewer that Christians or any religion for that matter, must be in the wrong.Even if they wanted to express their views on evolution so passionatly , they could do it without making Christian's look so wrong when they have no real 100 percent proof that Christians are totally wrong. Also I do think if a film was made today discrediting evolution , in such way , overacted way, making all Christains look right, I bet not many people who believe totally in evolution would go and see it.

(...)Mr. Bryan was a hero of the Faith and it is a blessing to read the closing argument he prepared, but was unable to deliver. If only our Christian statesmen and pillars of the community would speak in such open terms with such a glowing love of God and neighbor as he did. We have been beaten down by the godless backlash that followed Scopes, of which this movie is an example, but it is time for a new generation of brave Christians to face the threats which are destroying western nations from the inside out. Please let yourself be transported to the wholesome, healthy, holy, righteous vision of society which William Jennings Bryan represents and presents in the original source. This movie should have portrayed Bryan as a great man on the side of a greater Truth and Darrow as the slimy, worldly-wise man he was."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad a film, it quickly found a home in our rubbish bin!","review":"Total manipulation and bias throughout the entire movie.The Producers of this movie must have thought that the people viewing this film, are as stupid as the characters they had portrayed as \\"Christians\\".So far removed from any truth. The only thing this film is \\"based on\\" is the Director's own personal bias.Just because \\"one\\" has the money to make a film, doesn't mean that \\"one\\" has the intelligence to do so, or even the right to insult the intelligence of others.

As always, Spencer Tracy was a master of timing. When he weighed the Bible in one hand and Darwin's treatise in the other, it was a brethtaking moment to see which one he would choose. He tucked both under his arm at exactly the right split second. A moment sooner and the viewer would not have understood the point; a moment later and the viewer would have been let down by an anticlimax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This (Science vs God) movie held my attention all the way through but what Spencer Tracey movie does not?

Just him, I know there are already great Spencer and Katharine collections but this man has some absolutely amazing movies on his own. There are so many of them I am learning, and this one is one of them.

Hardly any of the conflicts are solved, and you're left with a feeling of disgust. That is only if you manage to make it through the entire movie.

I don't know if it is a product problem like a bad disk or whether the problem is in the transfer.

This sets up the film's centerpiece: a courtroom battle between famed attorneys, portrayed by acting heavyweights Spencer Tracy and Frederic March.Gene Kelly is surprisingly good in a non-dancing role, and gets the best lines as the cynical journalist from Baltimore (\\"Sit down, Samson, you're about to get a haircut,\\" he says to the teacher when his girlfriend is called as a surprise witness).Directed by the great Stanley Kramer, the film works well on a number of levels: comedy, courtroom drama, and commentary on religion's place in society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show Trial","review":"Spencer Tracy is always worth watching, but this film is static, didactic and predictable. People who praise it love its agenda, but are tone deaf about what makes a movie a movie. Now, nothing prevents propaganda from achieving artistry. But where an Eisenstein or Riefenstahl can fill a screen with action and drive, Stanley Kramer can only pull off an ideological back-to-school-night that does nothing to change or challenge minds.There's no drama here. The prosecution writes the script. The defendants are buffoons. The verdict is foreordained. The gallery goes home happily reconfirmed in its moral refinement. In short, a Hollywood show trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"A memorable example of artistic license","review":"Have you ever watched a program in which - as would be announced prior to it being broadcast - \\"only the names have been changed to protect the innocent\\"? Well, here almost everything has been changed - not only the names - and that not to protect the innocent but rather to delude them. When I first saw the film, I thought that it was an accurate protrayal of the Scopes Trial, and, being uniformed as I was, I continued to think that for many years afterwards.Is the film enjoyable? Yes, definitely; however, for the sake of honesty there should be a disclaimer at the start, declaring that it is a piece of fiction and that if one wants to know the truth about what happened at the Scopes Trial, they should not depend on this film for that.So I give the film 5 stars for entertainment value and 0 stars for truthfulness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted Without Historical Basis","review":"Although the acting in this movie is quite good, especially by Spencer Tracey, it is highly controversial. Many people, including myself, are offended by the negative portrayal of creationists. I also found out that the movie, typical with \\"The Hollywood Twist\\" is far from the reality of what happened in real life. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"Inherit the Wind is a fictionalized account of the Scopes trial in which a teacher was tried for violating a state law against teaching evolution. Spencer Tracy playing the defense attorney and Frederich March playing the prosecuting attorney give outstanding performances in this highly emotional drama -- which has relevance even to this day. This is one of the finest movies ever made and should not be missed, whichever side you are on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as relevant today as 50 years ago.","review":"Inspired by the \\"Scopes Monkey Trial\\", \\"Inherit the Wind\\" is a great courtroom drama as well as a study in religious fanaticism and dogmatism. The movie has a great cast. Both Spencer Tracy and Fredric March are great in the leads, and Claude Akins stands out as the town preacher. This movie may be 50 years old but it's (unfortunately) just as relevant today as it's ever been. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some things never change do they?","review":"I liked this film as it tell a story that will never go away.

The author writes in an almost stream-of-consciousness style that, at times, sounds like a TV psychic. In two different sections of the book, the author attributes completely different meanings to a single rune. The literal name of the runes were only explained for half of them, and there was little, if any, actual historical background on the runes. I exchanged this for Paxon's Taking Up the Runes. While still a bit New-Agey, it was definitely better than this. I wish there was a zero star option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"This is not a book I would recommend for those serious about the runes. It is very shallow and not up on its runelore.

I would, however, purchase more in depth books if you persue Runes further."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality check?","review":"I don't enjoy trashing anyone's work, but this book is quite simply bad. The rune meanings seem to have been derived from a certain other less than accurate Rune book put out circa 1982. Personal interpretation is one thing, assigning new and unrelated meanings to symbols over 2000 years old is another.For esoteric meaning, try Thorsson, Aswynn, or King, and for historical perspective Ralph W.V.

It may be a handy booklet on divination, but it has little connection to the historical runes. It could just as well substitute any set of symbols and do the same job.Anyone following the Northern Traditions will be disappointed, perhaps even offended. The author follows Blum's lead in creating a superficial divination system complete with the spurious \\"blank rune\\".

I guess it's a good introduction to runes if one has no idea whatsoever about them, but it focuses too much on divination, which I don't find as important as the archetypes and profound meanings of the runes themselves. It's a 'light' book alright, so it may suit some readers. For serious, scholoarly studies, refer to Edred Thorsson."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only rune book you'll ever need","review":"I have had several rune books, and this one is the best one, and perhaps the only one you'll ever need for working with the runes in divination.

Her source material is very bad and although she puts forth a valiant effort to make sense out of all of it, since she is starting from false assumptions, the book is ultimately flawed. The rituals are Wiccan in nature and so are the rune meanings which is not a good place for a beginner to start. On the plus side, she does have a whole section on carving runes and shares some interesting insights on bindrunes which keeps it from being a total loss. In the end it would be better to shell out an extra ten bucks for a better rune book. Remember Egil's Saga: the wrong runes carved on a healing charm made the recipient sicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on Rune-Casting for all beginning Novice Runesters.","review":"This is a great simple pocket-guide to the Runes.This paperback is an excellent primer for all new Rune students,as i once was.So,if you're a more serious divination student,you will quickly move on from the basics presented here.The next forward step would be ,\\"The Little Giant Encyclopedia of Runes\\",by Sirona Knight and later the Thorsson series.The\\"Blank Rune Debate\\" is a difficult one to side with.There are the faithful Rune Traditionalists and also the creative New-Age Runestres among us.This book is still a good one.You also might read,\\"Gods and Myths of the Viking Age\\",by H.R.

I was thrilled to get it initially, as the patterns and photography looked really good. After this project, though, I am seriously not sure if I will try another from this book. I consider myself to be an intermediate/advanced crocheter, and I have to say that the directions for this vest were not clearly written at all. I have been able to figure them out as I go, but I don't like spending that much time frogging and redoing my work. Let me make myself clear-I have NEVER had to work so hard to figure out what the pattern is trying to say.

I bought the book on Amazon.co.uk, the English Amazon. I am not very pleased with the patterns themselves as they are on the \\"old-school\\" style of crochet and not contemporary or unique at all.

I didn't need to do anything to entice him to use it except put it together and place it in the bathroom and he immediately came up and sat on it. He loves that it looks like the big toilet with a lid and toilet roll holder. Great product! Just bought a 2nd one for the downstairs bathroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS POTTY!!","review":"We bought this potty for my 2 year old and thought it would be a good choice for her. I was so wrong! There are so many peices which is a blast for my 2 year old to take apart that isn't even my problem. The darn thing is a pain to clean if she isn't sitting on it perfectly and pees sometimes it goes into the bottom of the potty which isn't flat has a bunch of little dividers in the bottom. Its hard for her to sit on correctly its tall and she is in the 75 percentile for height. We don't even bother with the blue part that goes around the bottom it just adds more height and we took the lid off because it kept falling and hitting her back when he used the potty. I am sorry we paid the money for this worthless potty go with some thing a little simplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for little boys, YUCK!","review":"The toilet is in three parts, the seat, the tub that holds the pee, and the unit that it all fits into.

The bowl sits in an bigger bowl but the sides dont meet and little boys who pee sitting pee into the bigger bowl, which is not easy to get apart to empty, creates a giant mess. Very nice soft seat otherwise a nightmare. Mother of three and all were potty trained early this is not helping this child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy & Stinky","review":"I don't have anything good to say about this potty chair. It i so messy and stinky. Somehow when my son pees it gets into every crease and crevice. Pee even gets into the well under the pot as well as outside of the potty too. Even when you clean it after every use it STINKS. The soft foam seat acts as a sponge and soaks up the pee. It still smelss like urine after cleaning it with bleach. While we used this potty my bathroom smelled like a nasty public restroom. My advice would be to by a potty chair with the least amount of seams like the Baby Bjorn products. Beleive me I have tried several different types of potty chairs and rings. 4 in all. So far I like the Baby Bjorn Trainer that goes on the regular toilet the best but if my son was just starting out I would get him the Baby Bjorn stand alone until he was ready to transition to the trainer that goes on the regular toilet. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS POTTY CHAIR. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Bells & Whistles!","review":"I like this potty chair because the seat ring is cushioned. My daughter hated her baby Bjorn potty chair because it was so hard, and when you need to sit for a while to make things happen, its nice to have cushion. My favorite part is that this potty comes completely apart - I actually can break it down and put it in the dish washer to sterilize every nook and cranny! Toilet paper holder is nice and its great to have a place to put wet wipes. You get a lot for the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Clean","review":"This seat is hard to clean and the pee leaks into the bottom and all around the sides.

With wonderful weapon selection and rate of fire choices you'll never get tired with playing this game. In fact this is one of my favorite games of all time. However I had to rate it 4 stars because of the multiplayer. Compared to its predicessor, Goldeneye, the multiplayer leaves much to be desired. With limited weapon and player choice you can't get the same level of fun as with Goldeneye. Also the AI bots (computer controled players) are of little challange so I suggest you stick to the one player.

The voice acting is supperb with the voices sounding just likle the stars(oh and by the way John Clese reprises his role to provide the voice of \\"R\\"). My only complaint is that the Multi-Player does not allow you to tinker with all the little things but it more that makes up for it by having a fanominal frame rate.

Also, in Multiplayer, you don't have much health. Two shots, you're dead. Another terrible thing about TWINE is that it takes time to load, which is strange, considering that it is a cartidge for the N64.

The two leads in this film reach for more, from opposite directions, like cave-dwellers sensing the warmth of the sun for the first time. Orson Welles is extraordinarily powerful in this film, easily one of the most powerful performances I've ever seen. His depth of feeling is like a raging storm, yet never seems overdone,.... amazing! Joan Fontaine wears timidity like a suit of armor in an unforgiving world, the only world she knows. But underneath, and from an early age, she moves with integrity and courage. I thought she did a marvelous job. Beautiful quality filming, a moving story, and a powerful range of feelings absorbed by the viewer. If this film doesn't leave it's mark on you, I would have no idea how to respond to that..... I am indelibly marked."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELL, WELL, WELL...","review":"All I can say is, it is about time that this classic was on DVD.

I was wrong. The original story was completely re-worked beyond recognition. Frankly, I don't see what the makers of the movie gained. It is obvious that a great deal of money was spent making the movie.

I remember flashes of brilliance and that's what I saw when I finally sat down and watched it. The casting is ridiculous: Joan Fontaine being too old and Orson Welles acting way over the top. Robert Stevenson was certainly not at fault and I'm sure he couldn't control Welles, who kept wanting co-directing and/or co-producing credit and David O. Selznick trying to control the whole thing when he had sold the property casting and all to MGM.The design and lighting are marvelous and the first part of the film about young Jane is incredibly compelling. But Joan Fontaine is just too sophisticated for the role.I have just ordered the British version starring Timothy Dalton and hope it is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly dramatic, untrue to the book","review":"Not only does this movie not adhere to the book in the least, leaving out such details as Jane's cousins, it also makes her determination to leave Rochester after learning of his wife seem paltry. An over-use of mist (every three scenes or so) where the mist-machines are all too visible, and thunderstorms every other scene add to the lack of realism. Rochester's crazy wife is only seen once, for about 2 seconds, where she jumps out at Rochester and tries to (as it seems) bite his neck. The characters are one-dimensional. The fact that the entire movie is dark, gloomy and gothic makes is almost funny, especially once you've seen (for the third time) Rochester, wearing a long black cape, leave his dark gloomy castle with a scowl on his face, mount his black horse and ride off with a yell into the darkness with mist swirling in his wake."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"The only good think about this is the story- the actors are horrible. I expected more from both, specially Orson Wells. It is black and white or the technical quality,( although the sound was bad- I had to turn my volume to 70 to hear it passably)- but those were not the only reasons I did not like it. Jane Eyre was supposed to be 18, not thirty and Joanne Fontaine could never act, Orson Wells was always glowering and abrupt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Classic...","review":"about a man who committed bigamy and was looking for a way out and the price he eventually paid.

Yes, carpal tunnel is a danger, but not for the school children in the book who use share a few computers for a few hours per week.

I think Commander McWhorter presented his war and training experiences in a very enjoyable manner. It was very interesting to hear how he got started in aviation and how his experiences gained him prestige from the local population as well as the people who got him started in flying. His first action in North Africa is interesting as he presents a rare glimpse into the stress of the unknown and how military pilots are trained so much that \\"the training just takes over.\\" I also found it interesting when he describes some of the errors he witnessed from some of his fellow countrymen aviators and how that made him upset. I think this book is everything I was hoping it would be, a look back into the mind of a very talented pilot with a very large resume of action and experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those that makes you think","review":"This movie is really slow to begin with and you wonder why you've been watching for so long. The payoff comes fast and furious as a transmission from outer space quickly transforms the quirky character played by Jodie Foster into a world renowned scientist. I don't know who plays the eccentric billionaire, but he steals the show. James Woods is a very formidable antagonist and will not give in throughout this movie. He has national security in mind and does not budge on any of his stances through the movie. You really begin to hate Tom Skerrit's character until he gets his final desserts.Carl Sagan is a famous atheist, but this movie, which has been adapted from his book of the same name, is strangely a search for faith and a god we can all relate to.

So be warned: no little green men (or big purple women)! But if you want to think about and imagine what it might really be like if we made first contact with an extraterrestrial intelligence today, you'll LOVE this movie. I read Carl Sagan's book, and thought the movie was much better--the movie had less fire-and-brimstone-style anti-religion preaching, and more of a thoughtful, focused, storyline. (Plus of course the obligatory hollywood-style romance.) If you want space ships and laser guns, skip this one. But if you want Earth-bound drama and edge-of-your-seat suspense, don't miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good movie becomes A GREAT DVD","review":"In some ways, this adaptation of Carl Sagen's novel does not work. There is very little chemistry between Foster and McConaughey (a relationship totally changed from the book), and the ending could have been better scripted.But I like this movie in spite of its shortcomings. It is a rare combination of an interesting plot line and great special effects. Jodie Foster gives a good performance.But if you're on the fence about buying this DVD, consider that it has great commentary tracks (by Foster, Zemekis, et all) and some fascinating behind the scenes explanations of how the special effects were constructed. One of the best packaged DVDs for the money.As a movie, this is good, not exceptional. As a DVD, it is a worthy addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warner Studios products questionable quality","review":"The movie itself is very good... no question. The issue is the continuous poor quality of Warner Studio DVD's. The quality of the mass produced DVD printing is too often poor.

Carl is no longer with us, but he was a key component in the production of this film.

You really get caught up in Ellie Arroway's heartfelt desire to make contact with another world. She gets her chance, and what follows is nothing short of miraculous. I cried during this movie. It tugs at your heartstrings in a big way at times. This is a truly great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"I don't need to say much since most of the reviewers here are right on with their opinions of Contact, but I have to say: the scene where the radical religious terrorist destroys the first launch site literally had my mouth hanging open...I'm not easily shocked my movies, but the special effects combined with the cinematography of that sequence had me in complete shock...a truly awe-inspiring film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I'm a believer in extra-terrestrial life for the exact reason this film's characters believe in them: if we were alone, it would be a pretty large chunk of wasted space. ALIENS EXIST! this film does a masterful job at how people would react to this message received back. and there is a powerful message about faith and science being able to work together, though that message may seem a bit heavy-handed.On a side note, i doubt we'd ever come into contact with aliens, and not for the lack of trying, but just because the distance is far too great. i would love it if we were to contact other beings, but it wont happen just yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent movie, worth seeing.

Clearly, everyone concerned thought that this was a Serious Movie. How wrong they were.Starring Jodie Foster and Matthew McCan'tAct, who are supposed to be carrying a torch for each other, but who demonstrate such an appalling lack of chemistry they don't even seem to have been introduced, much less lovers.Still, John Hurt makes the most of his few moments onscreen, but he just can't save a movie that sinks under the weight of its own High Serious Significance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie based off a book EVER!","review":"They seriously butchered Carl Sagan's book with this movie!

In all fairness, this should be a 2 1/2 or 3-star film, but the utterly appalling ending removes any possible enjoyment.Many other reviews have summed up the plot, so I see no reason to restate it here. What is so ghastly about the movies' conclusion is the premise that an intelligent, well-educated, experienced SCIENTIST; upon meeting an alien species is reduced to \\"faith\\" to explain what happened. I was almost physically ill. Faith is the ENEMY of science. It denies reason, ignores evidence, and accepts no criticism. To suggest that a scientist would throw away logic and reason in some sort of quasi-religious epiphany is not just stupid, it's insulting.Do not buy this. Do not watch this.Watch Star Wars instead.

And I recently watched a NOVA segment on \\"mirror neurons.\\" The acting of Jodie Foster and the girl who played her as a young girl, using my mirror neurons, had me \\"living the experiences\\" with her.Great, great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking","review":"This was another movie I had trouble finding in a store and wanted to add to my collection. I like the thought provoking ideas it promotes and while Jodie is the headliner, Matthew McConaughey plays a wonderful role."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful heartlfelt drama","review":"Jodie Foster does a wonderful convincing job with a solid character and script.Is the storyline far fetched? A bit. But even 10 years ago did you ever envision what you would be doing with a cell phone? A mini looking flat/skinny looking laptop called a tablet? The large flat screen tv I am sitting here watching football on is something I never would have imagined watching in my own home with a picture that is as clear as being there. I can go on. Tech advances SO quickly these days...why not the premises in the film? WATCH IT!I can watch this movie endlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Summer Movie that Actually Makes You Think!!","review":"For those who actually like to be ENGAGED when we watch movies, summertime is usually the nadir of the year. Lavish special effects complemented by treacly dialogue make me usually stay home when the latest \\"blockbuster\\" is released. However, in the summer of 1997, this baby came along and was a breath of fresh air. Actually having a movie get people to think about the meaning of life and their own existence is a fairly daunting task for a movie, but this one succeeds smashingly. Having used it in my classes, I can attest that these questions can cut across ages and get down to the heart of us all. It was also nice that this movie was fairly successful, making close to 100 million. Like the best movies, repeated viewings just strengthen the message within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This was a very good movie, but a little....loopy at the end. Jodie Foster plays an astronomy lover who dedicates her life to finding alien life. She falls in love with Matthew McConaughey, who's life is with God. Jodie's life takes a deffinite turn when she finds out that their is more than stars out there... Good movie overall. I recomend it if your into astonomy or just want a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intelligent Sci-Fi","review":"I am a huge sci-fi fan and Contact is a movie that I never get tired of. Contact is probably as close to \\"realistic sci-fi\\" that there is. No monsters, no gore, none of the usual sci-fi cliche. Some sci-fi fans may find Contact boring and uneventful- I personally find Contact to be extremely exciting and thought provoking. The acting by Jodie Foster, Tom Skerrit, and Matthew McCnaughly is perfection as usual. Contact is a must for a DVD collection. You don't even have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this extremely intelligent and thought provoking movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise destroyed by Hollywood touch.","review":"This movie is another example of how truly good sci-fi ideas are mutilated by the hollywood feel-good pandering ending. A good premise, which I would expect from Carl Sagan, and does bring up a good issue debating the meaning of religion in a realm of science. But then it goes way overboard, bringing in the extremists and the ending is laughable when the alien turns out to be in the likeness of her father. I did like the cinematography and as an amateur astronomer I liked the images of stellar objects, but the movie ends up sucking up to the lowest common denominator. C'mon Hollywood, I dare you, put more effort into making good movies, and leave the pandering to the media blitzing campaigns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Viewing","review":"I read the book when it first came out and loved it. The movie was different, but fulfilling. It is an excellent treatment of material that is hard to express as a movie the masses will want to see. This is one of the few science-based films made; most are science-fantasy or space-operas. The DVD adds to the final product with audio commentaries and effects explanations. Read the book, buy the DVD and share it all with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"creative yet realistic","review":"One of the best science fiction movies made. No doubt that Joddie Foster helped in showing Dr. Arroway's commitment in finding some extraterrestrial entity. This movie will make you understand that a contact between us and another world could end up in a catastrophy or simply in a new beginning for human kind. It showed me the fears, the hopes and the eternal search of human kind for a new future. Too bad they have not made a series out of this movie, it would have been as faboulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the book justice","review":"A young woman pursues her dream of searching for extraterrestrial life, then must deal with the consequences when her efforts appear to pay off.More than a science fiction thriller about the possiblity of life on other planets, this movie is a meditation on the persistence of the human spirit. In that regard, it is similar toCast Away [Blu-ray].From \\"Death Becomes Her,\\" to \\"Back To The Future,\\" to \\"Forrest Gump,\\" big league director Robert Zemeckis is one of the very best. He never lets the special effects dominate the movie, but very skillfully uses them to support thestory.This movie is a fitting tribute to Carl Sagan and his novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking sci-fi movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movie's of all time. the story kept me very interested at all times and it a suspense to it that rearly let up. Jodie Foster is superb in the title role. Excellent F/X and music. and best of all an excellent story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contact","review":"I liked the movie but got ripped off because the dvd stopped in the middle of the movie and I couldn't watch the whole movie.

The DVD I got was not the movie.It was a commentary about the movie ,not the actual movie. therefor I felt I was ripped off . I think the movie was great and I wonted to add it to my collection. So take heed and be sure to read the product description and get what you're paying for."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE DON'T WASTE MY TIME WITH MOVIES LIKE CONTACT","review":"Unfortunatly, I wasted my time watching Contact. To tell you the truth, I expected much more out of this film, especially since it was written by science fiction genius Carl Sagan. Jodie Foster, however, gave an exceptional performance, while Matthew McConaughy's character had absolutely no purpose. Secondly, I was expecting more of an ending. I know that some people call it a genius ending, but I just don't get it. I felt like I was being ripped off. Robert Zemeckis stole my money, made me sit through two hours, expecting a smash ending, and... what do I get? A lame ending. Who needs that? There are plenty of movies with crappy endings. I do recommend viewing Contact, just for the sake of it. There are one or two moments that are entertaining. However, this is the type of film that can only be watched once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good right up until the very end . . . then . . .","review":"Believable, well-acted, and fascinating, right up until thevery end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good but it's not - DVD review","review":"I was so disappointed in this movie. First of all were the stereotypes (illusion of dead father, typical currupt politician, boss who cares only for himself, truth about ETs is hidden).Second, it's simply not developed. It is 'wanna-be' deep. It uses a lot of 'big' words to make the viewer think they are watching an intellectual movie when they are not.Third, pacing. The whole movie builds up to a 36 minute ending. This includes the all important following of the ET's instructions. By this point, I really didn't care.Fourth, depth. It tries to touch on many points that it never probes any of them in depth. To see politics in the Space Program I recommend The Right Stuff (even though it is cleaned up version of the space program). All the questions the aliens left Ellie with, that she never really probed them about.The 'reunion' scene has been done better in Star Trek.Pass this one up for a real thinker. There are a lot of good Sci-Fi movies out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Science v. Religion","review":"The old Science v.

Why did the other docter want all the credits? Why is there the extremist?

Nothing of value at all. I am obivously miffed about spending 2 hours of time watching a horribly produced, poor plot with worse acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzz....","review":"I kept expecting something to happen, and then I realized that the film was over. I'm sorry, but this was about the most uncreative and sheepish attempt at a sci-fi story that I have EVER seen. Jodie Foster spends two hours reading stereo instructions, then heads off to meet the aliens who appear to her as a human. REAL CREATIVE. Boy, what a rush, my imagination is working overtime here. The love sub-plot is completely rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe you like that sort of thing but I was offended.","review":"I do believe that this film had some measure of intellectual stimulation. I also think that that quality was compromised by the immaturity of the characters. As intelligent people we should not lay blame on others for a short-coming. Contact seems to do just that. An example would be the involved religious question in the movie.This event makes the world religions look selfish and corrupt.There are other examples but you should decide for yourself. I will leave you with this; I love movies, in fact there are only two films which I did not completely enjoy. \\"Natural Born killers\\" was the other one. I do hope you will enjoy the show because I cannot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pacman2524","review":"I'd give it no stars if I could. I saw this movie in Denver when it first came out. Ruined my vacation. Just had to come here today and rip on it a bit. My least fav. movie of all time next to Disney's \\"Hercules.\\" Jodie Foster simply cannot act and has no looks. Matt M. did pretty good and Tom Skerritt also preformed very well. Story is very lame and ending was even worse. I thought this show would never get over. Then when it did end, I had to wait for the credits to make sure, and left thinking \\"that's it.\\" I was thankful it was over, but thought that \\"the projection worker had to of fast-forwarded it to help me out.\\" Graphics were pretty good, but I wouldn't pay to see them again. I wish I could get my money back from the theater and forget I ever saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My God","review":"This movie should not even be called a movie. It is an experience that is transcendant. It will make you feel. It will make you feel vast and open, like the utopian blue ocean. It is sublimely beautiful and visually extraordinary. It is not of this world. It is a message. In fact there are several. But the biggest one is that there is a God. Because that's who made it. I believe a movie can be such a thing as art, becuase this is it. Keep an open mind; it is simply too special to be appreciated by everyone. It's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"good suspense but too long","review":"I really enjoyed this film. Despite a slow start, the middle and the end of the film are GREAT.

Overall it is a good movie and worth the time to watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually Moving and enlightening","review":"Wonderful and mind opening and very Zen (from my perspective). I love the driven character of Ellie Arroway. Only Jodi Foster could have pulled off such a character with feeling and believability.The message should be taken to heart about how precious life is . We are a part of something greater. Whatever you concieve it to be. The effects were first rate and the addition of real news anchors helped with the belief of this scenerio. A fitting tribute to the late Dr. Carl Sagan and worthy of many viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best movie ever made!","review":"From the first time I saw this movie I loved it. Since then I've seen it every chance I get. It really makes you think. Are we alone? What are we doing here? Even if you don't like science fiction, you'll love this movie.

However, the storyline, overall acting and thought provoking issues that are brought up more than make up for it. This is hands down in my top 5 films of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"1997 gave us two of the best movies of the decade...Titanic, and Contact.

In addition, it is one of those films that gets you and keeps you thinking long after it's over. Contact is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, mediocre acting","review":"Foster, McWhatever, and even Woods all give poor, cardboard performances.

I can not understand: Since the woman came back without any evidence, why people just keep asking her, why don't they send another man into that wonderful ship again? And this movie just stop here with some words \\"...I believe that\\", \\"...I believe her\\".... Actually, you could believe anything and nothing real! Question: shall we believe that every one from us has had the outer-space experience in our night dream?The second star I gave to this movie is for the first 2 minutes and when the woman touching the sky with her finger.Nothing better than Year 2001 and Year 2010, not at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending","review":"The previews hyped this film so much.

What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Jodie...?","review":"This movie has just about everything right about it - apart from the usual ending which is totally ridiculous. If you were about to send someone into a machine which you didn't understand, to somewhere you had no idea about etc etc (aka Stargate experience) - why send Jodie? She spends the entire end of the movie crying - I can't really see a marine getting too affected by all that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A science fiction \\"Field of Dreams\\".","review":"If you saw FIELD OF DREAMS, well, this is the sci-fi version of it, with a woman building a spaceship instead of a man building a baseball diamond. Like so many movies in all genres in recent years, it is overblown and pretentious, actually fantasy with the trappings of science fiction. It is technically excellent, of course. Movies with multi-million dollar budgets generally are. If you are looking for a movie that is really Serious with a capital S, don't miss this one. It is serious, all right, but it is not much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the first movie I've ever reviewed on Amazon","review":"I've watched quite a few Amazon movies in the past two years but this movie was something different so I have to write a review of how much I liked it.I love this movie. I cried man tears a couple times, and I never cry in movies. Last time I cried in a movie was when I saw Ghandi in theaters... except that time was sad tears. This movie made me cry because of how beautiful it was, idk, something hit me like a resonating wave and shattered me and my only response was tears of awe and joy.Truly a transcendant experience.This was just my personal experience, probably won't happen to everyone. No, I did not watch this movie while under the influence of anything, although I imagine that may be quite an experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is assigned watching for college Ethics class.","review":"This movie is rich in ethical points of view. It ranges from the insane who believe their harmful actions are saving humanity, to non-ethical behaviour by saying what ever it takes to succeed. the moral of the movie is amazingly simple yet illusive to even the wisest of Philosophers.The special effects are fantastic, the casting is brilliant and the writing is incredibly profound. A definite 5 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better","review":"First, the very opening of the movie is fantastic - almost worth the discounted purchase price by itself.The special effects are really quite good.The acting ranges from good to poor but, is generally passable.The story development and character interactions are OK if one hasn't read the book.However, if one has read the book there is such a distortion of both characters and their interactions and loss of sophistication and nuance as to be quite maddening.Ah, for what might have been!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey Hollywood junk","review":"Everything wrong with Hollywood movies is found in this movie. The central concept of how the Earthlings would deal with knowledge of the existence of an alien civilization is dealt with in a superficial and melodramatic way. The actors' were all melodramatic, though some of this may be blamed on the screenplay. Foster gave a very bad and unconvincing performance. When push came to shove, she wimped out in her defense of her atheism (though that's the screenwriter's fault). She was horribly miscast. To this day, she still looks like a teenage tomboy. Only Skerritt and Hurt gave convincing and interesting performances. If you're watching this on cable, skip the first 40 minutes. If this is truly an accurate rendition of Sagan's novel (which I haven't read), then I owe the film's makers and actors an apology. But from a purely cinematic viewpoint, it's extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!","review":"Robert Zemekis' Sci-Fi flick is filled with potential. Great use of President Clinton images. Realistic usage of CNN anchors and reporters. It's special effects are visually stunning. The problem is the script. The storyline lags behind the technical portion of the film and in the end, it left me with a bad taste and plenty of open holes that are just not believable. It tries to be like \\"Close Encounters...\\" and ended up like bad religious version of \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still\\" without the nukes! I was just not impressed with this effort!! Sorry!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully touching film and an eyeopener for me","review":"I love Jodie Foster.

The rest of the cast, which includes James Woods, Angela Bassett, and Matthew McConaughy (sp), are pretty competent but they can do only so much when the script goes south towards the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most offensive movie I've seen in years","review":"This movie purports to be about science, but it posits science as something one takes on faith.

Jodie Foster plays an utterly humorless and emotionally icebound BUT totally brilliant young woman (a type of role she is becoming tiresomely expert at) who is supposed to be carrying a torch for the appallingly inept Matthew McConaughey. The lack of chemistry between them makes a significant part of the story rather hard to swallow. Namely, one can't believe that Foster's walking iceberg has any interest at all in the McConaughey's inane all-purpose guru.This movie is to serious science fiction what a Hallmark card is to Shakespeare. Slight, admittedly rather efficient, but ultimately forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong code!","review":"The product was probably OK, but its Regional Code was not suitable for Australia.

If you think there's going to be lots of interesting special effects, fast forward the film after the first five minutes to the last ten minutes. This should save you hours of boredom.

Let me put it this way: I saw it as part of a double feature with Disney's \\"The Cat From Outer Space\\", and it made that poor excuse for entertainment shine in comparison. (Then again, there are a bunch of people that gave TCFOS 5 stars on Amazon, so maybe I'm off base? Whatever.)Think \\"Corvette Summer\\" with cheesy special effects.

James can't sing a whole song for nothing so he has to sing each part of hte song instead of the whole thing.this band's new album is pretty bad too. The songs rip off STP and fails to hit great catchy songs which GNR, STP, and Def Leppard did best.I'll give this CD credit though, its way better than Brenadan Schiapetti's terrible Bleeding through CD.

If your not, you may want to listen to this one a few times over before you decide on making a purchase. Eighteen Visions obviously is influenced by a lot of Punk bands, and this CD shows it. You can tell that they have some Punk in them by listening to the guitar riffs in some of their songs on \\"Obsessions\\". Even though it seems that this band has some Punk in them, the brutal melodies and ear-piercing screeches that most Trustkill bands express are still present. Their lead vocalist really knows how to sing, and it compliments the band's guitars and bass very well. The drums are also great. If you like this CD, then you should also pick up a copy of \\"This Is Love, This Is Murderous\\" by Bleeding Through, or \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" by Unearth. Both bands are similar to Eighteen Visions."},{"rating":"1","title":"THESE GUYS SHOULD BE JAILED FOR SELLING OUT SO BAD","review":"Eighteen Vision's first CD, Until the Ink Runs Out, was AMAZING hardcore. It was basiclly what Atreyu wished they could be. But this? This is crap!!! However, I can't say it's TOTAL crap, I id find a few good songs....1. Obsession - Great intro to a HORRIBLE album. 4.5/53. Crushed - By far the best song on the CD. I love that guitar riff. This sounds like it could have been on Vanity. 5/55. Pit of Snakes - Yeah I agree there are too many choruses in this song, but the riffs during the verses are pretty good. 4/57. Waiting For The Heavens - Okay song, but a little too many breakdowns, though. 4/5As for the rest of the album, it sucks. Only buy it if you worship 18V and must have EVERYTHING by them.

This band is worshipped around where I live and I just don't get it. They really suck. The vocalist tries to sound like Chino Moreno and Scott Weiland all through the disc, and it's quite obvious. Every song follows the same formulas in song structures. Verse/chorus/shorter verse/chorus/sometimes a bridge/chorus/end. There is only like a minute worth of good material on this CD and it is the brutal as hell breakdown on track 5 (of which the rest of the song is horrible) Their older stuff isn't any better either.

People don't give them enough credit for their music. They have great songs that are very diverse which makes it even better because why would you want to listen to a cd with every song sounding alike. They have really good lyrics and the music is awesome. I love how they could go from a song like \\"Tower of Snakes\\" a heavy song to a song like \\"I Should Tell You\\" a more melodic sounding song. That shows that this band has real talent and creativity.

But changing your music in a big way so that all the teenyboppers on mtv will like it truly IS selling out. This band sure as hell did it. Earlier cds are much better than this one.

The vocals leave something to be desired, however, the music is good. A lot of these comments about this album, from users, say it's not metal enough or hard enough. Honestly, if it were any harder, this cd would suck royally. When are people going to realize that harder doesn't mean more hardcore or more metal? I am beginning to think these poser \\"gothic\\" idiots (you know the ones who dress goth and think they are full of hurt and anger they need to crave attention) won't like hardcore unless a band just screams their lungs out. Sorry to say that doesn't make you more \\"hardcore\\". So all you sh*theads who think that, have no f*cking clue.

Its just not the 18V that the most die hard of fans fell in love with, no breakdowns, or the hard driving rhythms that made 18V who they are today!, There is just nothing on this offering that made the past 18V albums so metal. I do like the fact that James Hart has a good voice, and carries the music well. Jason S. made a good decision by leaving this band and sticking to what made \\"Saved by Grace\\" who they are!

Buy this album it kicks ass. Its different from Vanity but like they said on the dvd they would be selling out if obsession didnt sound the way it does.

Where do I start? Eighteen Visions is an excellant band with great music, good guitar riffs, and a kick-butt attitude. I absolutly loved this CD. It has to be, by far, the best one they've put out. I felt really touched when I listened to the song \\"Waiting For The Heavens\\" and learned that it was dedicated to a friend of the bands' who had passed away. It was really nice to see a semi-hardcore band show their soft side, and what better way then to put it in words. \\"I Let Go\\" and \\"Tower Of Snakes\\" are also really great songs that everyone should hear. In the end, all the songs were great. They have a really catchy tune to them. Once you start listening, you cant stop.

James' vocals are so much better on this CD than when he tries to go clean on Vanity. Mudrock has given 18V the best sounding album of their career so far. All the songs are awesome except for the last one, which seems to be a common curse with 18V albums. The album as a whole kicks ass and then when you get to the last track, it sucks. It makes the album feel like a big tease. This album kicks ass, bottom line. It'll be in my stereo for a while probably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"I am no hardcore afficianado to speak of, but I am a huge Eighteen Visions fan, and frankly \\"Obsession\\" just doesn't cut it for me.

I thought \\"Vanity\\" was sort of step down from the totally intense sound of \\"Until the Ink Runs Out\\" and \\"The best of\\", but \\"Obsession\\" is just a fall down a flight of stairs.I am truly bummed that the album came out the way it did.

It doesn't taste like Vanilla to me. It doesn't say organic anywhere on the packaging though it states so on this Amazon description. If you find something better, please share/comment. I'm going to search for something else that is organic, vanilla ground bean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Madagascar Vanilla, ground","review":"The product was shipped very fast and I received it in good condition due to the excellent packing. Thanks for the immediate reply and shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"Disappointed with the lack of flavor in this vanilla. Also, as other reviewers mentioned, the vanilla had an unusual taste. Would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Bad...really, really Bad!","review":"This is not a good example of 5.1 sound in action. The \`artist' seems to have no sense of quality in his recording. The pioneer of \`ambient' music, Brian Eno would cringe. It's bad enough that the recordings are uninspired or lack creativity, but it's also the plain old fact that they are horribly recorded. There are \`pops' and \`cracks' throughout that are loud enough to startle. Sometimes there is hissing similar to an analogue recording and frequently, the sound disappears completely for a split second. Not once did I feel I was experience true 5.1 surround sound. It sounds like it was recorded in a garage, for Lord's sake! Be wary - 5.1 DTS can be much, much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Ambient Music in Surround Sound","review":"This is one Diatonis' finest pieces of work next to Ambient Life. I found I connected to it on more of an emotional level. It isn't ear candy but rather music that subtlety evokes an emotional response. The surround sound element really enhances this effect as well. I would not suggest buying this album if you want to disassociate for your current state of mind. It simply won't let you, it's deep. The sound of the album reminds me of Eno in some places but is primarily in a category of it's own. It is a CDR and I've had no problems playing the album but apparently some 5.1 systems can't play a cdr.Great Album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Questioning price","review":"Why is this book, Painting Snow and Water being sold used for $59 when the bar code on the back cover says it is $19?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Singing in the tub","review":"This product isn't perfect, but once you figure it out, it's not bad. if the mirror was why you bought it, send it back. it gets foggy before you can lather up. the radio is hard to tune. only major stations tune in decently, but flex out when you move your hand away from the dial. if you do get tuned in to a station you like (which may take few minutes) they're still a bit static-y, but that gets drowned out by the shower anyways. it's easy to set up, is fairly priced for performance, and quenches my thirst for music world domination furtherance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Showers : Enhancing your bathing experience","review":"This product is a must have if you like singing in the shower. The built in mirror is handy for those in shower shaving moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector Barbie","review":"She is well worth the money spent on her, the value will continue to climb because she is a platinum label barbie. I did invest in her. She displays very well too."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning","review":"all i can say is dont buy this item because the seller will take your money but u wont receive anything in the mail. i ordered it like 8 months ago and still have not received the cd so dont buy it!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Great as Lead to Believe","review":"The book was almost 99% pictures which was to be expected and I liked the color illustrations, but my biggest gripe is the lack of written detail about the battle. Four pages just doesn't cut it and on the first page, the author mentions military units that just didn't exist at that time or played a part in the battle. He mentions the IVth Panzer Korps, which I believe he means the XLVIIIth Panzer Korps. The German 2nd Caucasus Army is mentioned, and no such unit existed unless he's talking about Army Group A. Its easy to make a book of pictures, but if your going to write about something, it would be nice if the person doing the writing knew what he was talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid book.","review":"In a nutshell a very photographic display of one of the most underrated series of battles during the Great Patriotic war. Both sides bled a great deal to claim this particular city."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no music","review":"This is not a mix tape, its an unauthorized biography by some other guy, and its great that it comes with a free mini poster and all, but I'm about 50, and not someone elses views of him.
