From the offset he talks about his love for clasical music and hearing a single note fade away to silence. I didn't buy the book for classical music, I bought it to enhance my rock and roll experince.

The ring is operating below the radar of local law enforcement, but comes under scrutiny after ensnaring a small time cop in their dealings.Gunther gets wrapped up the case, as much because he is wondering how his long involvement in law enforcement is starting to effect his life. Is he cynical or numb to the sights he sees and the lives he intersects with?The case centers on the life of one man, his underage runners, a woman he abuses and children caught in the center of it all.

I did not have the problem with the handle getting hot. My problem is the cleanup. It is a NIGHTMARE to clean. Even though it is non-stick, it seems to get entirely too greasy to wipe off. I had to let is almost soak...then use the spray in the kitchen sink at odd angles as to not get the inside where the wires are wet somehow.I would not recommend that you buy this product, if you are at all concerned about getting it clean after each use. I absolutely loved the waffles that it produced, but it was not worth the cleanup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor heating","review":"This is my second Krups waffle maker in 10 years. The first one worked well and lasted for 9 years without a problem so I bought the exact waffle maker to replace it. This one is horrible. The heating is very uneven so that the waffle is brown in spots and white in spots when it's finished baking. If I let it bake anymore (which I've tried, just to even out the browning) I end up with a burned waffle.I wouldn't recommend this Krups waffle maker to anyone. Obviously it's not the same one I purchased 10 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Waffle Maker! Deep Grooves!","review":"I slapped together a generic Waffle recipe found in an older cookbook to give this waffle-maker a try. I enjoyed it! At first, it was a little odd, because the grooves are very deep. I am used to the flatter waffles, so I was not filling the grooves in enough. Otherwise, the waffles came out great! Nice and crispy, and evenly cooked.The only thing I think could be improved, would be a bigged ridge or edge around the waffle mold, for over-spill. You have to fill the unit up almost until spilling to get enough batter in there to fill the top half of the mold. Or, maybe my mix was not quite right, and did not rise enough.I really enjoyed waffles from this Krups Waffle Maker. If you like to put fruits, and lots of toppings on your waffles, I would recommend this one for you, because it has deep pockets to hold lots of flavor and toppings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A family tradition can continue!","review":"I received this waffle maker from my late father in law as a Christmas present. Soon it became a family tradition to make Belgian waffles for special brunches, especially with strawberries and whipped cream. We even brought it in the RV when we went camping. Imagine my dismay when the heating element broke down after 13 years of use. It was a joy to find it here on Amazon so I can continue the tradition. About the hot handle issues: I always used the plastic clip to raise and lower the lid, and I used a plastic spatula to pry the waffles free. If I cleaned it up right away there wasn't any problem keeping it clean. It stores easily and heats up quickly. The waffle recipe in the directions is delicious. I can't wait until my new one arrives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed (2nd time around)","review":"So I got the Krups waffle maker (exactly the same as this one) for my wedding 12 years ago and used it about 2x/month all those years. After making delicious waffles EVERY time, it finally stopped working this year. I went to many websitesm reasearched the daylights out of the newer models, and purchased another one for $100. It made mushy waffles. So I returned and purchased this one thinking, if it ain't broke.....I got the waffle maker quite rapidly and used my Krups 3 times over the last 3 weeks. I was really dissapointed every time. The bottoms of the waffles were perfectly done, but the tops were completely uncooked. Not sure of if the Krups quality has gone down or if I have a defective model. I plan to return immediately but am unsure of what to do now, as we are a waffle-lovin' family and I need a reliable model.

Careful not to scratch the nonstick off the plates.Otherwise a great waffle maker. Love the plate designs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt like it","review":"Got one about a year ago and don't really like it. It looks good and stores vertically. I do like the light that says when it is hot enough. But that is the end of the likes. The back 1/2 cooks much hotter burning the back, leaving the front a little less than done. The light that alerts you when your waffle is ready is set way too high. That problem combined with the uneven heat leads to disaster every time. The non stick surface is a joke with and without nonstick spray. This machine has wrecked more waffles than I want to remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you spray with cooking spray or you won't get it open!","review":"I had a cheap waffle make before and this one it worse than cheap!

However we didn't like the very confusing red/green LED system used to indicate whether the waffle maker was hot enough to make waffles.

First, the electrical cord is so short, you must put the hot iron under cabinets to reach an outlet. The manual says this is a saftey precaution as to avoid entanglements, although I have never had such a probem before. I wonder if Krups will replace warped cabinetry after several uses. The handle is too hot to handle. I cannot believe that Krups would put such a poor and dangerous product on the market without someone testing it. The waffles were crispy and delicious, just not worth the hassle or the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just stopped working...","review":"I have had this waffle maker for a little less than two years. My son has a serious egg allergy, so I bought this so we could all still enjoy waffles with an egg-free recipe. I have used this 2-3 times per month, making large batches at a time to freeze. When eating them fresh, I personally didn't think the waffles got crispy enough in the maker, so I always had to toast them after they were made before serving them. Also, as many others have said, it is VERY difficult to clean. Gunk builds up and you almost have to use a toothpick to get batter out of every hole and crevice. About two weeks ago the waffle maker would not heat up. I took it apart looked inside and then put it back together. I plugged it back in and it worked and made a normal batch of waffles. I tried to fire it up today to no avail. Today it is going in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality breakfast in very little time!!","review":"I make homemade waffles for my daycare kids about twice a week.

At least once a week I make bacon in it. I slice a pound package in half and load this baby up. The trick is to take the half sliced bacon strip and fold it in half. It holds 1/2 lb bacon exactly and after cooking it max time on timer, bacon comes out perfect or flip at end of cook time and add 5 min for crispy bacon. Best part is with the lid down you get no bacon splashing. I am on my second grill and have not found anything better.

Prior to use, I was very excited about being able to remove the grill surface for cleaning as that was an aspect of the original George Foreman grills that frustrated me. Upon opening the box, I was disappointed by the small surface space of the item. After two uses, the product failed to heat up. I contacted Hamilton Beach and they promptly sent me a replacement unit. Now the \\"removable\\" grids have melted to the unit! Two strikes...I honestly don't think I want to try again. I'll give the George Foreman with removable grids a try now. Maybe in a few years the bugs will be worked out of the Hamilton Beach model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgive me George for I have sinned!","review":"Ok, so it has removable plates that you can wash separately, this is the ONLY bonus to this item.It takes forever to cook something as it doesn't get hot enough, the plates don't lock in very well and the item is way too bulky for such a small cooking area.So you can lay it flat to cook pancakes - whoop de do, my frying pan works just as well.I was hoping for so much and was very disappointed in this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Product: Quick and Easy for all kinds of foods!","review":"I bought this after I saw a link to it while looking at the Foreman grills. This grill was less expensive has an internal drip tray (simple, less conspicuous, and less likely to tip over), removable trays for dishwasher or sink, and a variable timer. I use it for cooking veggies, sausage, all other meats, and hot sandwiches! It is so very very easy to use and clean. I would highly recommend this item to anyone, especially if you want cooking that is easy to clean, so basicly I recommend it to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"good with problems","review":"The grill works as good as its predecessor, but is smaller.

I went through 2 foreman's. The nut shell of my issues with the foreman were:the non-stick came off and they are a huge pain to clean. The Hamilton beach solves both issues. Since they are easier to clean by being removable, you don't have as much gunk burned on them, hence lighter scrubbing and the non-stick lasts longer.And as far as having the Hamilton Beach not get hot enough, I have never had that issue. I pre-heat for 7-10 minutes and cook. It works fine. I think those people either had a bad unit... or their last name is foreman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye George","review":"This grill is great. I will never go back to the George Forman grill. Unlike \\"George\\", you don't have to unplug it to turn it off - it has on/off/timer knob.Also, and probably the best feature are the removeable grids. With just the push of a button you can remove the grids for cleaning - and they are dishwasher safe.Another feature which outdoes George is the drip tray. With the Forman grill you have to place a container in front. If you misplace this container or forget - you get grease all over. With the hamilton beach, the drip contain is attached to the side, already in place.Cons - I couldn't find any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over George","review":"This is a great product.

However, if you don't spread oil or butter over the plates, food such as fish and chicken will stick and the plates should be soaked to clean. It cooks food very quickly I haven't seen any better competing product, including George Forman.

It is a lot cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"George is hotter but Hamilton Beach still wins","review":"When i first got the grill, i was very disappointed. Whilst it's larger and has the removable grids, it was not as hot as my old George Foreman and it seemed as if my foods were steaming. However, after several months, i've discovered a few secrets to cooking on it and am much happier.1. preheat it for a minimum of 5 minutes, maybe 8.2. don't overload it all at once3. if your food is very lean (or skinless) it won't sear well right away. Marinading will help. Also, if you spray your meat with Pam or drizzle alittle olive oil on it (sounds gross but what the heck) it'll help sear it.Bottom line is: Even though my old George cooked hotter and faster, my new Hamilton Beach remains champ due to ease of cleaning. I love the convenience of popping out those grids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad to get my new one!","review":"I wore out my old Hamilton Beach Grill, so got this new one. Thankfully, the J&R; sent me the right one. I like the # 25325, the bigger grill. There is a smaller, white grill they sell, but that is too small for me. I wore one of those out, too.I use this grill twice per day. Once for breakfast sausage and then at night for burgers or dinner sausage. The timer makes this grill so easy to use. After 1 year of heavy use from me, though, the teflon wears off and performance degrades. Most people will not use theirs as much as me.Remember to get the George Foreman grill sponges for cleaning the grill plates! They are blue and black and fit into the grooves, plus they are non-abrasive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hamilton Beach Mealmaker the Best","review":"Started out with the small Foreman grill, hated the messy cleanup, bought a smaller Hamilton Beach and loved the ease of cleanup and timer, now have the 25325 that is big enough for the family, love it, love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous steamer","review":"I had a George Foreman for a couple of years and it was great: easy to use, regulable temperature, safe to handle.This Hamilton 25325 is nothing like that.First, it's dangerous. If you want to open it you need long protective gloves. Otherwise you'll get burned by both the handle and the (very large amount of) steam that this thing creates.Second, it lacks basic features like regulable temperature and safe handle.Third, as many others have said, this thing *boils* your meatFourth, food retains a lot of fat because the surface barely tilts downwardsFifth, it takes ages to cook something. With my previous foreman I could put a frozen steak and have it ready in 15 minutes. With this thing, 15 minutes are not enough to cook non-frozen steaks.Sixth, the steam weats it all around.In short, do yourself a favor and don't buy this thing. You are going to regret it from day 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in most ways.....(read on)","review":"I bought this to replace a Villaware grill which I also bought on Amazon. The problem with the Villaware Grill is that the grease does not all run down to the tray....some of it routinely gets under the bottom removable plate in into the heating area (BAD design).This grill is really nice...yes you have to wait for it to heat up, but the Foreman's also take time to heat up.The grills are easy to clean and if you're careful with them, I can't imagine anyone would have problems with the non-stick surface peeling off.The only issue I have is 1) the heating element should've been bigger and the grill should've gotten hotter, and 2) the plastic housing should have been produced to better withstand the heat.My grill's plastic housing is starting to bubble a bit by where the steam escapes. (Yes, because of the fact that heating elements aren't hot enough, you get a lot of escaping steam.All in all...so far, I'm happy with the grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill","review":"When I tried this grill for the first time, I threw my old grill in the garbage! this is the almost perfect grill, the only thing I would change about it is, I would give the back a little more hinge room to open wider, to get even thicker products inside.Cleanup is a breeze with the heating plates being removable, much better than my old grill.I was in the market for a new grill when I found this one and could not find one to match the price either.Great Grill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Better than my George Forman","review":"The removal of the grills make clean-up so much better.

And that's about it.It does not have several settings. It just has up to 45 minutes of cook time. Very primitive and it dries the meat! I hate it!!!!!! I grew up using grills as such on daily basis and they were much better than this thing! They had several settings; one for fish, one for meat, one for chicken and other settings as well. The food came out succulent and tender. I used it once and feel bad to have wasted the money on this item :( I wish I could return it! We actually threw it away in the garbage! That is how bad this grill is!DO NOT BUY IT if you want to taste beautiful grilled food that makes you happy. This is not the grill for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This movie is an odd mix of strong women, and weak men.

What a big disappointment, I sent the proctor back within the week. The proctor does not chop, mince or anything for that matter herbs. It just pushes the herbs to the bottom and sides. I tried different herbs (rosemary, chives, basil, etc.) just in case with the same results. I did not try chopping veggies since I bought it exclusively for herbs - so I don't know how well it chops veggies. But in terms of herbs it's an absolute waste of money. I packed it back and sent it back to amazon - thank god for amazon return policy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The motor turns only if the jar is empty or water in it. This is not even capable of chopping some spinach leaves. I am positive because I tried it.

I decided to buy a mini processor/blender and after reading the reviews here on Amazon, I decided to purchase the Proctor Silex 72500RY. Big Mistake! I tried making a dressing with ginger. I cut small slices and put it in the chopper along with some honey, mustard, and a little water. Some tiny slices of ginger never got chopped no matter how many times I tried. Very frustrating. I should have shelled out more dollars and bought a better chopper!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good chopper","review":"This is my second one. I had the first one for about 10 years.

I have never had the bowl to crack on me.In addition to simply chopping produce, I have made guacamole in it, turkey and tuna salad.Given the price and that this baby handles its given tasks well, this was a GREAT purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality of body plastic","review":"The mixing container cracked within the first month of its use.

Ive tried the Black & Decker & I honestly like this one the best for that specific purpose. I like that you turn the lid into position and the blade begins to spin immediately- it isnt a 2 step process, where you click the lid into position & then hit a button like other mini choppers. For the price, it is a perfect garlic chopped and it is good if you want to mince onion. Making pesto would be good as well. I would not go as far as to say that it replaces a normal chopper- even for 1 person as this chops food into such small pieces that for something watery like onion- it pulverizes to more of a rough mush than a fine chop. I truly love this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little chopper","review":"This thing seems to work well. It's efficient and easy to clean.

This chopper does all the above. I do have a caveat though. The advertising suggests that the prospective owner intend that he/she use it with only that single person in mind.

It comes apart easy for cleaning too. The only thing that annoys me is the way you have to set it up and start it. First you have to make sure the bowl is situated properly (there is a tab on the bowl that has to fit into the correct spot on the base), then the top has to be on correctly to slide into the groove and then you have to hold it to do the actual work (oy). I don't mind having to hold it but the other set-up steps can be a bit cumbersome.

We had problems with it from the very beginning! We drink A LOT of coffee and it started to be very tempermental within the first few weeks. The finer we would grind the beans the more the lid and push button would become jammed. I cleaned and dusted it often but it continued to jam up. Then about six months later I put the beans in, put the top on, pressed the button and a peice of plastic flew off. The peice of plastic was from the push button which made it possible to make the machine work. It would no longer push down when the lid was placed on - therefore it no longer worked. I would not recommend this product for someone who drinks a lot of coffee. It may be OK for someone who isn't a serious coffee drinker but it seems to me it cannot handle heavy use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Product","review":"I paid a premium price for this model for the \\"chrome\\" appearance.

Now the plastic has broken - both the cover and the part that must push down to start the grinding process. My experience was confirmed by two other review writers.

First, the cover of the machine must be carefully twisted into place, and after each grind, the track upon which it is twisted becomes filled with ground coffee and must be cleaned out mechanically (simply turing the machine upside down and shaking is insufficient). Second, thanks to the wide-mouth design, it is difficult to empty the coffee into a normal-sized filter without creating a mini-explosion of grounds on the counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Engineering","review":"The static electricity created by this machine assures that your coffee cannot be transferred to your brewer basket without major gyrations.

Not off key or anything, but there is no gusto or power to her voice. Listen to the Natalise samples, the other Asian singer, it's a similar type of overly girly, weak voice. If you like voices which are strong and powerful that can catch your attention and touch you, these girls are not for you. No, I'm not racist, I'm also a singer AND I'm Asian. Makes me wonder just HOW these girls get contracts. Being able to write and compose music doesn't automatically make one able to SING. The lyrics are also OVERLY generic in that corny pop song lyrics kind of way. There is no depth to this album in her singing nor her composing this album. Very disappointing, I would love to see an Asian artist that can come out and SING with a HUGE voice.

I must say that I never saw any tin from cutting falling in the can. I am particular.

You will have to stop and restart it numerous times to get it to cut through the lid for the first time and then it usually just grinds. After a few minutes you will have metal shavings all over the rim of the can and then you'll have to throw your can away because it's ruined the lid or the shavings fall inside when you do finally get the lid off.

Only recently has the motor been getting balky and the opener less efficient. I guess that's pretty good for many years of constant use.Only two complaints: this thing works well IF the part that holds on to the can is set at exactly the right angle. This can take a little trial and error. Also, I'm left-handed, but I have to use this opener with my right hand because of its design.I love the nice, clean edge it leaves on the can. It's impossible to cut yourself, and the cutting blade doesn't get dirty.Not perfect, but very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great experience with this opener","review":"I received this can opener as a gift almost 9 years ago. Absolutely loved it from the first use - no sharp edges to worry about and rarely needs to be cleaned. Also, no flakes of metal and can label left on the counter. Now, over 8,000 cans of cat food later (and few human food cans), its starting to need 2 turns around the lid to unseal properly. I was afraid they didn't make it anymore but was happy to find it on Amazon.com. Not sure why this technology hasn't totally replaced the traditional electric can opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love this Can-Opener!","review":"I've used this can opener for the last two years, and am buying a second one! This can opener is safe and very easy to use once you have learned the angle to start opening the can with. One review mentioned metal filings in food, but I have NOT had a problem with this through two years of heavy use.I feel this type of opener is more sanitary, since food is not gummed onto the opener itself. It also does not leave edges on the can tops that cut your hands. The opener can be used on any size or height of can, which is a great improvement over the counter models. I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for metal in your soup!","review":"My wife insisted this can opener is a great idea. However, after several uses I noticed tiny pieces of metal in the food product. The design of this type of can opener is seriously flawed.We have decided to use the old can opener since it does not drop metal into the food.It is not initially obvious that metal pieces are ending up in the food. You have to look very carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buying another!","review":"I'm so happy with this product that I've just ordered another as a Christmas gift. I've had mine for about a year and it cuts along the outside of the rim. So I no longer have cross contamination of food and the problem of the lid falling into the food. The cutting wheel stays clean! Also, there are no sharp edges around the lid like the old-style openers.A previous reviewer mentioned metal shavings--- I can't see how this is possible unless their unit was defective somehow. The only complaint I have is it is sometimes difficult to line the cutting wheel up with the can and I sometimes get a false start. Once it engages, it runs without a skip! Oh, by the way, I've tried the manual versions of this new type of opener and they take a lot of muscle. Stick with the electrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is nice if you like metal shavings","review":"This is my second Krups Open Master Can Opener. The last one was perfect until it died after 6 years. I immediately bought another Krups. This one is not worth a dime.

I am now back on Amazon looking for a different can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's great -- but only when it works","review":"The biggest problem with this can opener is that some cans don't seem to \\"give it up\\" and while the lid is indeed disconnected from the can and spinning round and round, the lid will not come off. Other can types refuse to budge at all and continuing to try and try will generate tiny metal shavings -- exactly what many users of this product want to avoid.So, when it works it's a \\"5\\". When it doesn't work, I'm rinsing the can off and rummaging for the old fashion can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointed","review":"I bought this can opener 9 months ago. It worked well for the first 7 months. Now the darn thing will not open a can unless it spins around at least a half dozen times. And to make matters even worse it leaves metal shavings behind. Extremely dissapointed, I went out and bought a good old fashioned electric can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy another one of these...","review":"I bought this opener because I liked the idea of not getting food on the opener blade. After around 2 years of use, the mechanism has worn out and it will no longer open cans. I'm going back to a 'regular' can opener!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Opener Heaven","review":"Great product, great price. Backed by Krups great engineering and workmanship. Opens cans quick and is light and easy to use right out of the box. NO SHARP EDGES!Only drawback to me is that it's not cordless.Well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like most \\"safe\\" openers","review":"I bought one of these and as anyone who has used a \\"safe\\" opener knows, they take a knack to get the lid started. I loved it for about the first six months. This is basically a very good product when compared to the manual type of \\"safety\\" openers in that that they last longer than what I have found to be about 100 cans. The wheel that guides the can to the cutter is made from a material that is much too soft though and repeated attempt at opening a can by someone like a 13 year old will wear the gripping teeth right off. This renders the perfectly good opener useless and thus landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wears out too fast for working great","review":"I wanted to add another voice to the reviews that warn people that this product wears out too fast. Ours quit after less than a year. If replacement parts were easy and cheap, I would fix it myself because the result of successfully opening a can with this product is GREAT. The lid is reusable, which is great for pet food. No sharp edges. No food contamination. Tough on guests, though, because they don't know can is opened and they tend to spill!It does take some talent to get the thing started on some cans. As the things wears, it gets harder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware....","review":"Received this as a gift and it's another appliance collecting dust. When it works, it works great. Difficult to use if you can ever figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and fairly difficult to learn to use","review":"I have a manual can opener that accomplishes the same thing, and it cost a little over 3 dollars.My mother in law bought it from a TV advertisement. It's easier to use and works faster and better than this one.A thirty dollar can opener should be able to jump in there, open that can and then some. Alas, this one whirrrrs nicely, debates the task and finally chews its way around the edge. Ahhhhhh finally it opens the can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is the first can opener that I'v had that worked this easily. It is so easy to use, that I suspect that many have the same problem my wife had --- its so easy to use that they couldnt believe it and tried to make it more difficult like all of the bladed openers. Just set it on top of the can and push the button and let it do all the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"This piece of junk started making ominous noises after opening fewer than 50 cans. Before 100 cans were opened it gave out completely. I'm going back to my old, reliable B&D electric opener that hangs beneath the kitchen cabinets."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Weightlifters Only","review":"I wanted an opener that did not leave sharp edges so in spite of the hefty price I bought this one. Talk about HEFTY! It was hard to hold because of the weight, hard to position for the same reason. It took 30 minutes to open a can of soup, and my hand was cramped. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! I'll never trust the Krups name again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching a roulette wheel","review":"Loved this can opener when new. After 18 months, round and round it goes. Place your bets folks...how many revolutions will it take to open the can? Numerous revolutions leaves the can's edge ragged with the risk that metal shards might drop into the food. A very expensive lesson in poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...when it's working :(","review":"I agree with the general consensus here that the can opener works great and it's wonderful not to have sharp edges on the lids...but it definitely doesn't last! We actually found someone to service ours after it stopped opening cans after about a year or so, but it was almost as expensive as buying a new one. Now another year or so has passed and again it's not opening cans...I was thinking of replacing it because I love it when it's working, but after seeing so many others with the same problem, I'm going to switch to another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your reviews changed my mind.Thank you!","review":"I used this can opener for about 18 months. First I had to learn to use it. It worked very good for about a year and then became gradually more difficult to use. My husband never got the 'hang of it'. I really like the way it opens a can without the sharp edges and intended to order a new one because it will no longer open any can. It appears that this product has a major flaw, namely it only lasts a short while and then you have to go back to the old fashioned way of getting a can open.Since other reviews are similar to mine I have decided not to order another Krups can opener."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sorry I bought it","review":"As we own several other very good KRUPS appliances, my wife insisted we bought the 404-70 Open Master Can Opener. I was quite reluctant to do so, but bought it anyhow. When she tried it, it took several tries to position the unit on the can, so it would open it. We both have used manual and electric can openers, and are not novices in the kitchen area, but this model is particularly difficult to use, as it requires lots of patience to have it work. It is now collecting dust in one of our kitchen drawers. We have replaced it with the \\"Rolls Royce\\" of the Manual Can Openers... a deluxe Stainless Steel KUHN, which has a safety lid lifter, is easy to operate, and will be possible to use in case of electric power shortage."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very durable","review":"This can opener broke down after about a year of using it once every few days. If you buy it, you should not expect it to last much longer than the warranty. I wouldn't buy it again. Krups should take it off the market or fix it so it lasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"electric run away","review":"We have a can opener very similiar to the one shown above, it is a ( KRUPS OPEN MASTER,MODEL 404.We did pay a consiserable amount of money when purchased.IT will not shut off while running and,the button for shut off has never worked right.It does get very hard trying to catch the can in the right spot on the opener. NO SHOP IN OUR AREA WILL TOUCH THIS APPLIANCE.(BY THE WAY THE PRICE WE PAID WHEN WE PURCHASED 39.95)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"The reviews of this can opener are just great. Don't understand because it's a piece of useless junk as far as we're concerned. We're not trying to open weird cans unless you consider Cambell's soup or Stag chili weird. It doesn't cut deep enough so in general makes a mess that my old reliable manual can opener has to clean up. Happy for anyone that can make this junker work for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best ever can opener","review":"The krups 404-70 open master can opener is the best ever, my wife has rheumatoid arthritis and loves this appliance, We would like to purchase 2 more but cannot find it anyplace. If it is still available, please let us know.A satisfied customerHarold Goldstein"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade wears out FAST!","review":"The mechanics of this can opener are terrific EXCEPT for the quality of the opening blade. It wears out in less than a year of moderate use. A replacement blade costs $23 + shipping from Krups so you have no recourse once it quits opening cans except to deposit it in a landfill.We are on our 4th one and have finally decided to go back to the mechanical type."},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups Can Opener","review":"After using the \\"cutting-wheel\\" type electric can opener for years, I decided to switch to a \\"safe-edged\\" can opener. I've had the Krups can opener for five years and found it to be quite good. When the Krups finally gave out, I purchased a Hamilton Beach safe-edged can opener. It lasted about six months. I'm going to purchase another Krups and hope it will last as long as my first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups is ... in my book","review":"I purchased a Krups can opener in June of 2000. Initially I loved it. I do not open many cans perhaps 2 per week on average. The Krups was a novelty for me. After the warranty period it began to have difficulty opening cans. I read and re-read the owners manual to ensure I was operating it properly. I cleaned it religously. Now it will not open a can. I went back to the manual opener. I asked Krups for some consideration since my unit was barely beyond warranty. They told me I could send it back and they would fix it for up to $..., if it were to cost more than that they would contact me. A new unit cost $... at nearly any store. I work in a retail store and have most of my life. I don't know of any manufacturer other than Krups that would not have replaced the unit for free. I cannot recommend this or any Krups unit based on my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"the good the bad and the ugly","review":"The \\"good\\" thing about the Krups can opener, it's the best opener on the market when it is new. The \\"bad\\" is only getting a couple of years use out of it. It will be difficult to open a can properly and watch out for the fine metal shavings and burrs. The \\"ugly\\" thing is what it will do if it doesn't open the can and you get stuck or cut by the metal shavings or barbs. ...It was a promising kitchen tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opens Garbage Can Lid","review":"The can opener doesn't work for an extended period of time - like for a year or so. When contacting Krupp's, they gave the usual line that they would fix it if you send it back. The hassle and price of shipping is not worth the effort since it would only work for another year - if that. The last lid it opened was the garbage cans! I'll never buy another Krupps product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Last","review":"We have owned 3 of these over the past 5 years. They are great when they work, but these have not lasted more than 18 months. Not sure I'll buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Few things still get & Deserve a 5-star rating","review":"If you want a fine product, ...get one of these openers. We bought one when they first came on the market, have been opening cans of all types day after day, from green beans to cat food and sardines. Never a mess, never any cross-contamination of one smelly food with another, not only that, but the metal cans themselves are still good for all kinds of second lives, like mixing paint or epoxy. Our original one finally is getting sort of tired, we just purchased another as fast as our little feet could carry us to the store! At that, the unit still works, but has become more temperamental lately on certain types of ring-tail opening cans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution some cans?","review":"I purchased a 404, because I had a manual opener that works the same ($12) but I provide the power. Loved it, bought my girl friend one. Two or three months later my girl friends 404 started tearing up the side of the can lip and not opening the can. Mine followed suit a few months later. The cutter seams to have lost it's cutting edge. The only thing that seams to be the problem is steel cans. But that should not break the 404."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes","review":"I loved it when it worked! Mostly I found it lacking in reliability.

Never again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best can opener ever made!","review":"We have had a Krups Model 404 Open Master for about seven years now.

It is a great story about honor, honoring your parents and your country, and love; and how love and honor are intermingled. My only problem was with the digital technology.

I contacted the vendor but he didn't even bother to respond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reject the Disney formula.","review":"Please tell Walt Disney that you do not like to have your intelligence insulted. Do not see their movies or buy their cheap plastic garbage. As several other reviewers stated, the kooky side-kick characters are just lame. The lame stereotypical depictions of good and evil were very shameless (big, dark, neanderthal-like villians with red and yellow glowing eyes? please). One might argue that these films are fun for the kids, but that may not be true. In driving for profits, Disney sacrifices quality and artistic style for a bland product, geared towards pulling profits. This is an unfortunate phenomenon, because any appreciation for art fails to be conveyed to the audience. This problem can also be seen in the new Star Wars film, which likewise strives to pull profit rather than be at all artistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"This is not what Mulan is like! Read it from a real Chinese standpoint and you will note the difference. Why has Disney forced their views on a Chinese one? They should leave my culture alone. They know this isn't the real Mulan and I know they don't care. Otherwise, they would have taken some ethnic responisiblities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drooling for Mulan","review":"I guess this is as good a place to admit it as anywhere, but I've actually got the hots for Mulan! The same thing happened a few years ago with Pocahontas. Disney keeps churning out these extremely attractive female cartoon characters and poor benighted souls like me are left to pick up the pieces. At least with real movie stars, we can always fantasize about someday meeting them on the street and striking up a conversation, but Mulan will always remain out of touch.Anyway, back to the story. It's well made and interesting because it shows that Disney is waking up to the fact that the Sleeping Giant itself is waking up. There are over a billion people over there who need to be woven into Disney's world view and this is a great way to do it. The bad guys are the Huns, but, as with a lot of Disney villains, they are actually quite likeable, as long as they don't touch a hair on the head of my sweet little Mulan, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"IT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS RAN OVER BY A TRAIN.

I must have laugehed a billon times throughout this whole movie (which I rarely do when it comes to movies) and also became very enthralled in the whole concept of the story. Mulan has comedy, romance, action and most of all DRAMA!!!! What else could people want???? Plus you add a great cast and the star of it all (who played Mulan) (the girl, June, From the Five star movie 'THE JOY LUCK CLUB')!!!!! A wonderful heartfilled movie...not too sappy and not too dumb! It's....PERFECT!!!! GREAT JOB DISNEY!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Honors A Classic Tale","review":"Disney's Mulan is one of the most subtle pieces of work to come out of the Disney studios in years. There is a quiet charm to this film that makes it quite enjoyable to watch again and again. There is of course the required sidekicks (Eddie Murphy as a very not chinese Dragon, MusShu) and the heroine's pining balad (\\"Reflection\\" who's single version performed by Christina Aguilera was mercifully absent from radio rotation). But for some reason Mulan doesn't seem as desperate to impress or entertain as the more recent Disney animated features seem to be. Produced almost entirely by Disney's Florida unit, Mulan is a refreshing departure from what we're used to from the Mouse House, and a welcomed one at that. The DVD contains no bonus material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Heroine","review":"Mulan doesn't exactly listen to her folks but she tries to do the right thing and she has very strong family ties. She joins the Army in her father's place and ends up being a hero of China. It's not at all historically or culturally accurate but at least there's no wedding at the end of this Disney flick. It's nice that there is a strong female character in the female Disney lineup and the songs are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brave heart","review":"Disney really reclaims itslef with Mulan. After the disturbing sexual innuedoes in the Hunchback of ND, Mulan brings a strong self of character to Mulan. Mulan takes her fathers place in the Chinese army and in the process disguises herself as a man. The switch proves to be both hilarious but shows the strength and love Mulan feels for her family. The dragon (voiced by Eddie Murphy) injects even more humor and choas in this delightful tale. In addition, the colorful backdrop of China's countryside and villages weaves a comfortable blanket around this story in which to enjoy. In Mulan, Disney has created a character were young girls can find independance and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Disney's Best","review":"This film is one of my very favorite Disney films, brimming with memorably catchy songs and stunning visuals. The storyline is usual Disney fare at heart, but one must realize that it is indeed a children's film. Overanalyzing the storyline of a children's film is like scratching an itch with a knife - a little overkill. But Mulan's story is filled with messages of honor, strength, the importance of family, brotherhood, and love. It is s a film filled with humor, color, music, and values. A true Disney classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulan has heart.","review":"Mulan fits well in the long line of Disney's princesses who make us laugh cry and sing. She was a welcome addition after a long getaway from the happy go lucky princess story line. not only did she keep up the high par of romance and adventure, she broke boundaries that disney had not yet crossed. an adventure where the princess was not only a heroine of the story line but a heroine of her entire country. kudos to Mukan and kudos to disney.

This label didn't show up on the original listing - it wasn't until the second screen that it said it, and there was no warning that I found that described what 'Region 2' meant.My daughter was disappointed on Christmas morning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely movie for the whole family","review":"Mulan is funny, dramatic and great, and I rank it among the best Disney movies in recent history. ��t\`s music also brings a lot of entertainment, being in English or Spanish. Definitely you should watch it with your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Devoted Daughter--Mulan","review":"I've heard Mulan's legend since I was a little girl. Although we don't know if she was a real human, our parents or teachers liked to tell us about her. We think she was brave, but we most respect her devotion for her father. The film shows how Mulan decided to be a soldier for her father, how she cheated every guys in the troop, and how she became a hero. We've heard her story several times, but the film still moved us. I'll collect this film for my babies-- my students and my future children, because it has meaning of education."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney has Done it","review":"I believe that this is one of my favorite Disney movies. Maybe what I like so much is that Mulan is not waiting for her prince to come or any damsel in distress deal, but she is an intelligent woman held down by her society. The story: Mulan's father is old but he is called to war. He will probably die. Mulan decides to take his place. This is remarkably unselfish because if she's discovered she will be killed. This shows how much she loves her dear old dad. You just have to see the movie to appreciate it. The songs are amazing (\\"I'll make a man out of you\\" Donny Osmond's voice is fantastic). The extra features were also pretty good. I found \\"I'll make a man out of you\\" in all different languages very interesting. The animation is great as it shows a lot of the natural beauty of China. So make sure you don't miss one of Disney's greatest(and probably last judging by the way Disney is going down the drain) animated movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie about my culture compared to other Disney movies!","review":"The Disney version is different from the real story of Hua Mulan. In the real one, the Imperial Army didn't find out that Mulan was a girl until afterwards. Also, in the true story, there was no talking dragon named Mushu nor was there any cricket named Crickee. There are some flat characters and stereotype in the story, but it still shows a lot about my culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's GREAT!!!!","review":"I like the part where the bad guys are down in the snow and they come back up again and when Mulan kills the master of the bad guys. I like when Mulan gets back to her daddy with a necklace and a sword. I like when Mulan gets her dad's armor on and gets into the army and she pretends to be a boy and nobody knows it. She's pretty and she's strong... that's what I like about it. Everybody should buy it because then they could have it in their home and be happy and watch it and keep it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is the best!","review":"This movie is so great- a girl getting to be a hero and a leader and not just some sappy beautiful lady in a prom dress.

But I was disappointed that Disney couldn't often tell the difference between Chinese and Japanese. The film is very Japanese-ish in colour, costume, and style, and the appearance of a Panda, tea (a teapot with a handle! Unheard of!), and the Great Wall try to carry it off with mere icons. This is the only disappointing part of the movie. THe rest is spectacular, funny and exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending to another country","review":"Knowing this was being sent to USA it would have been good for the sellar to share that the DVD would not work in a DVD player in the USA due to country restrictions.

All the characters are well-defined (and a little exaggerated in true Disney fashion), and all play their parts. There is no part of the film which seems contrived. The music is excellent, the songs are appropriate and the storyline is very plausible. The actors who have given voice to the characters have elevated the film considerably too, especially Eddie Murphy as the bumbling dragon Mu-Shu. I will not bore other reviewers with the story- but I would exhort them to acquire this masterpiece. It is one movie which I enjoy a lot, inspite of the fact that I am not a child anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mulan","review":"It was sent to me in German!

I gave it only 4 stars though because there was so much implied violence, but that was difficult to avoid given the plot. Though there was a lot of implied violence, but my 4-year old didn't know what was happening. Disney did its usual good job of implying any violence in a way that younger kids who don't already understand death and killing already, aren't left with questions due to the movie.

And how did 12 Mongols defeat the entire captain of the guard for the Emperor, and take him hostage? And for the finale, how did a little Chinese girl take out Genghis Khan with a staff when he had a sword and was seven times her size? On further note: Eddie, we know your drug addiction is using up a lot of your money, but that is no excuse to sell your voice to a shotty movie like this!

THE WOMEN LOOK LIKE JAPANESE WOMEN, THE ARMOR LOOKS LIKE SAMURI ARMOR, AND THE SWORDS LOOK EUROPEN. HAVING FUNNY SUPPORTING CHARATERS IS BECOMING LAME. THE ONLY THING I LIKED ABOUT IT WAS THE HUMOR, BUT THAT DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR THE STORY.

However, this movie is layered with the typical Disney shallow characters and stupid antics that is in all their other movies of the past 20 or so years. I wish Disney would stop making movies that 'sell' and start telling good stories with some depth again. Thank goodness I only paid $1.99 for the 48-hour rental.

However, in the cartoon, she was too common to attract others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie Murphy steals the show!","review":"Mulan is one of the finest offerings from Disney in years. Eddie Murphy as Mushu is worth the purchase price all alone. This much better than some recent Disney efforts (such as Hercules). Also, the sweep of the movie is spectacular. But the highlight is Murphy who is in top form as a wisecracking dragon. His performance rivals that of Robin Williams as the Genie in Aladdin. This may not be up with some of the classic Disneys but it certainly comes close.Mulan, You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Special Effects!","review":"My favorite part of the whole movie was when the Huns charged over the mountains on horseback!

I seem to have more fun than she did. But we both love it. Disney contiunes to out do themselves. It was a formulated story plot line, with the songs neatly placed in between to set the mood and tone etc. But it was very well done, and I loved the fact that a girl was the hero. Something long over due in cartoon films. And my favorite song is Donny Osmond singing I'll make a man out of You. Plus I love all of Disney's Villians they have the best villians that I have ever seen in cartoons. Frightening and menacing just the right touch. The Huns were bad!!

It's in Mandarin but last time I saw the 1961 movie it had English subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another (yawn) Disney \\"Masterpiece\\"","review":"It amazes me how shameless the Disney people are, slapping that label \\"masterpiece\\" on every recent animated feature they've done. And so too with \\"Mulan.\\"This could have been a real provocative piece of storytelling. But once again, Disney plays it safe, following the formula of past successes. We get great animation, but a superficial story. Nothing really insightful about Chinese culture, history, or for that matter, gender, is revealed. The cute \\"sidekick\\" characters (this time a hip, wisecracking dragon) in these Disney features are getting very stale. The obligatory songs, which often trivialize what little meaning is found in the script, also get very predictable.I keep hoping that one of these days, Disney will really give their talented animators a chance to do a feature like no other -- a new work which will be looked back upon as redefining the storytelling power of this medium. That would be a \\"masterpiece,\\" and \\"Mulan\\" is far, far from it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulan is a timeless masterpiece...","review":"\\"Mulan\\" is a timeless masterpiece based on an age-old Chinese tale that reminds us of the fundamental reasons why life should be celebrated: loyalty and friendship, honor and dedication, family, friends, humor, and love.

It doesn't follow the traditional story-line of Disney movies. It is new and creative. It ditches the romance and features a female heroine that actually is a hero. She saves China! Another thing is, this is the only animated movie my 11-year-old brother likes. Quite an accomplishment. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because it lacks the traditional music that all Disney movies posses. There are some songs but they aren't very memorable.

The animation is clear and crisp in the DVD version. The attack scene on the snow bluff is truly awesome and thanks goes to Disney for allowing us to choose the format to view the movie, since the scene is really impressive on the widescreen. This movie is worth the money, although I think it lacks one good love song between Mulan and the Captain at the end--- Donny Osmond singing with Lea Salonga would have been awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compared to some Disneys","review":"Basically, it comes down to this. The good things about Mulan - good songs (esp. Be a Man) witty lines, especially from Mushu, a heroine who can fight and be tough and isn't sickeningly good, some pretty tough scenes, like the destroyed village, and good drawing which looks sort of Chinese but also realistic. The bad things about Mulan - it's OK for Mushu to speak like a westerner as you get used to it and accept it, but stuff like 'jerks', 'quit' and 'guys' jars when the other characters say it, also despite the feminist overtones Mulan still goes home and gets married in the end. I knew nothing about the original Mulan story so can't say how it fares in that respect, but as a Disney movie it's great - much better than Pocahontas."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST FROM DISNEY !","review":"Very good.

Depending on how long you cook the waffles, you can make them as crispy as you want w/o burning the outside. My only complaint is that it's difficult to clean the outside when batter leaks into the crevices - I need to use a toothbrush to fully clean it.

This is my third waffle iron, first one I had this problem. Using slightly less batter produces holes in the waffles.Also, it produces waffles the same thickness as Eggo.

I was floored to find that these books were being marketed to the Nancy Drew reader. Many naive parents who purchase this series would be quite surprised at their content. Do you really want your child to be reading how Nancy Drew \\"sexily smiled\\" at a stranger? Parents who fondly remember days snuggled up under the cover with a good Nancy Drew book will randomly pick up this series expecting the same good mystery and wholesome read.

Although Disney has mastered the art of taking one story line and respinning it through the years into countless permutations, Lion King II takes this approach to a new low.Visual production values are fine, and young children won't know the difference, but you will be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better sequels","review":"Disney has put out, if not the best sequel to follow any disney movie, i wasn't expecting another excellent movie like Lion King from this sequel, but it is worthy of a look, i enjoyed it alot, obviously it doesn't stand up against \\"The Lion King\\" but i don't think you'll be disappointed especially if you've seen some of the sequels disney has spewed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as good as the first","review":"This is not as good as the first. the story starts with the celebration of kiara's birth. then one morning kiara goes to play in the Pride Lands. she promises Simba that she will not leave the Pride Lands, But Simba doesn't think that she will keep her promise so he sends Timon and Pumbaa to watch her. But they lose her and she runs of into the outlands. there she meets Kovu another young lion cub. But what she doesn't know is that Kovu is Scars hand chosen son.

The opening \\"He Lives In You\\" is nothing short of spectacular.I have since bought the CD so I can enjoy over and over again.The second song \\"We Are One\\" is an exceptional duet with Simba and Naula. My 5 year old daughter and I sing it often.To me, the real measure of any film for children is how often we hit the rewind, then play button on the VCR. This one is giving both buttons a heavy workout.Thanks for not disappointing me Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"I have seen the original a dozen times it's one of my all time faves.

That is all that matters to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mediocre knockoff","review":"This is a direct-to-video sequel that is clearly inferior to the masterpiece original. Not only are the images crude by comparison and the songs forced, but the story is almost identical: outcasts loyal to Scar plot a revenge and almost have their way; a romance ensues between lion pups that will have serious implications later on; and the theme of renewal and reconciliation win out in the end. My kids ignored what I saw as a boring rehash and clearly enjoyed it thoroughly. I simply could not suspend my disbelief and let the story carry me forward, always in the back of my mind I was thinking someone was trying hard to make this interesting and fun. Instead of a deepening of the wonderful themes of the original, it smacked of formula like the worst of TV drama. No surprises, no development of characters, no new challenges to overcome. Just the same, only more.I would not recommend buying this. But if it is on, the kids can plunk down to watch it while parents can do other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lion King 2 - Simba's Pride","review":"Just want you to know that I am unable to give a review of this DVD.

My children were frightened by the weird characters and loud conflicts. Plus the storyline was not redeeming; children can learn these \\"lessons\\" without being frightened. Regardless of Disney's marketing on TV during preschool shows, parents of young children should beware--I think there are much wiser selections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"I got this movie the 1st year it came out (back then i was lion king addicted actullay i still am) I LUVED it! but now that i'm older i'm not so sure about it. it has a sappier story line then the last one. girl goes against father orders falls in luv with \\"Bad\\" guy you know? still it is a great movie but for us older veiwers it is boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LION KING 2 RULES BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE FIRST!","review":"WOW!!!!!!!! the movie is cool!

I missed having a Hans Zimer score though, the music was just lame in part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very worthy sequel","review":"I enjoyed this sequel. The songs are enjoyable. I like the songs \\"He Lives in You,\\" \\"My Lullaby,\\" and \\"One of Us.\\" Plus the story is a sweet one. The romance between Kovu and Kiara is sweet. Also, the story is dramatic. This second film is darker and grimmer than the first film. It does have some funny parts, though, provided by Timon and Pumbaa and also by Nuka. I also like the bonus feature \\"Proud of Simba's Pride,\\" which is a backstage behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie. It's good even though it's really short.I'm a big \\"Lion King\\" fan and I was pleasantly surprised back in 1998 to find out they were making a sequel. I was diagnosed with cancer before this film came out, and it provided me with a means of escaping my illness. I really ejoyed the movie and hopefully you will, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"... Truly a masterpiece","review":"Alright, I never saw the DVD, but the video, and I thought it superb. A friend of mine lent me Stuart Little, Lady & the Tramp 2, and the Lion King 2, three movies I've been wanting to see for a long while.I first watched the Lion King 2, and I instantly fell in love with the movie, the music, and the characters. The songs are simply wonderful, and the story is very romantic, but full of plenty of action.I loved it so much I watched it about 10 times and never touched the other two movies!It would, however, be wise to rent/borrow it before buying it, just incase you don't like it...But I can't see why anyone would hate it!!Take my advice and buy this wonderful movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"*****","review":"This movie is very powerful and can have a lasting impression on you. It's a great movie for kids, because it has their favorite charcters, and it's a great movie for adults because it helps to teach their children that parents want what's best for them but are not always right. One thing that disturbed me though was that Simba has completely shaken off the happy care-free lion that everyone loves. He is now just too strict and expectant of others. But when he banished Kovu in the song One of Us, I just wanted to pull Simba's tail off for doing that. It was such a wonderful movie, I have to fight to hold back tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy Take on the Original","review":"I have no idea why Disney seems to take splendor out of creating bad sequels out of good movies. This movie did nothing but take my confidence out of Disney, and even some of my admiration of the original Lion King. Not only being quite sappy, the humor is far less then amusing, mostly consisting of overplayed jokes which were never that funny in the first place. Furthermore, it lacks orginality and creativity. Maybe I did not enjoy this movie as much as the Lion King because I am no longer a kid, but I'm betting that even some children can see the lack of potential within it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"This movie was horrible compared to Lion King I. It felt like deja vu with a lot of the scenes in the beginning and I couldn't force myself to sit through the whole thing. Stick with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirit of the First","review":"I don't get why so many people hate this movie. I'm a HUGE Lion King fan, and I think that this one fully captures the spirit of the first movie. The new characters are very well done, especially Nuka and Kovu. Some people complain of how Simba acts differently in this one. Well, he does, but if those people were OPEN-MINDED they would see that Simba is trying to act like his father, but he comes off as a jerk. This movie is great and the songs is just as good as the first one, although the music to the evil song in this one (My Lullaby) is not as good as the first (Be Prepared), the lyrics show the feelings of Ziera in a different way then you might expect. But all the other songs are beautifully done. My only suggestion to those of you who will see this movie is to watch it with an OPEN MIND, and try to read between the lines, because there you'll find something great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one and watch the original again.","review":"Why Disney refuses to re-release the original \\"Lion King\\" into theatres beats me. This movie sucks. The original is Disney at it's finest. This whole story didn't grab me at all. I didn't care about any of the characters. Do not buy this movie. If you didn't see the original, do whatever you have to to get a hold of one. That one is worth the trouble and any price you have to pay. ORIGINAL is AWESOME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very not well done!!","review":"I was realy realy disapointed when I saw this movie.It seems that Disney did not work on the movie so hard.The charictors are not well drawn, the music is not the best - No Work On This At All!!Some see it as a work of art - I don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"briilant","review":"not, i only write brillant so you'll read it, any way this film isaboustly dogs poo, take my advice and watch the sing a long, this film is badly put togjhter, simba's voive sounds like a duck and kafu looks like a gorillavery po film, watching paint dry is more funthank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is supposed to be about Africa, not China","review":"Kovu was a Chinese immigrant.

But I found the move to be lacking in so many ways. The music made me wince - that was probably one of the worst things in the film. The songs were completely forgetable, and cheap.Don't get me wrong - I adored the Lion King. And I thought it was interesting to have the daughter fall in love with Scar's son. But it was a poor follow up to that wonderful first film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gees, what a loss!","review":"The lion king 1, I've seen it over 100 times and it's not enough, but the lion king 2, I've seen it once and it's too much.If you rent it, you throw 5 dollars away.

I think they shouldn't have done it."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Disney movie I've ever returned","review":"My family and I really liked most of the first Lion King movie. However, the upbeat and humerous feel of the first is nowhere to be seen in the sequel.Simba's Pride was very dark and evil. Most of the songs are like Scar's \\"Be Prepared\\" song from the first movie, which I did not like. The main theme of the movie is training an assassin to kill. The only redeemable part of the movie is the very end. I understand their must be good vs. evil in any movie, but I don't like it when the movie dwells almost entirely on the evil.My kids (ages 6 and 4) did not like the movie and didn't want to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"beyond speedy delivery!","review":"Item was top notch and delivered quickly!

I searched in several different stores and none of them had it so I turned to Amazon. The shipping is only a small price to pay for a movie you really want.This movie is great, although some people don't like this movie. I really like the song, 'Love Will Find A Way' because of Liz Callaway. Another good thing about this movie is they did not skimp on the graphics, normally when they make a sequel to a Disney the graphics are not as defined and more flat therefore making it not as appealing as the first.

The Lion King, Simba (Matthew Broderick), has brought a new generation into the world with his daughter Kiara. She does not want to be queen, so she runs off into the Outlands, where she meets Kovu (Jason Marsden.) This young cub is the heir-in-training to Scar's Legacy, under the protective, if somewhat manipulative, claws of his mother, Scar's evil, murderous, vindicative and angry widow Zira (Suzanne Pleshette), and her two sidekicks, Nuka (Andy Dick) and Vitani (Charity Sanoy).

However, I purchased it in the Kindle version. Hard to flip back to work book questions and information in this format. It would have been much more valuable in the regular paper and ink version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed; a one sided approach to the problem","review":"Although the author does a good job of describing difficult mother/daughter relationships, she lays all the work to repair the Mom/Daughter relationship squarely on the Mom, over and over again. Do this, do that, etc. etc. She tries not to \\"blame\\" the Mom, but, throughout the book, tells Mom what Mom needs to do to repair the relationship. What about what daughters need to do? I guess, nothing, since they are difficult, thus the title of the book and they, the difficult daughters gets a pass. It's not a balanced presentation on how both parties should work to repair the relationship. Or perhaps, the author needs to give Mom a pass, and tell her not to bother, if daughter is so \\"difficult\\". She offers only one solid working suggestion for the daughter, not practical, if you live any distance apart, ask your daughter to go into therapy with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mothers of Difficult Daughters: How to Enrich and Repair","review":"These authors are way off base. Daughters who are 'difficult' are so because they did not get what they needed from their mothers in the first place. The women who like this book are mothers who failed at parenting and now want to blame it on someone else, and guess who is handy.Mothers with 'difficult' daughters are themselves difficult people. They need to look inside first in order to find the source of their daughter's pain. Instead of blaming their daughters for being 'difficult' (which is like blaming the unhealthy fruit from a neglected orchard), these mothers might better show some responsibility and read 'Making Peace with Your Adult Children: a Guide to Family Healing'."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not your fault!","review":"If a mother really wants to improve her relationship with her daughter, this is wrong book to read.

My friends and I have often joked about the Anarchist Handbook/Cookbook. So, on an Amazon.com buying spree, I picked up a copy. As I flipped through the book, I was shocked at the crap that was in it. Anyone with any skill in these areas would know how dangerous the stuff is that's in that book, and would never follow any of the cookbook formulas/instructions.

Though the tactics described in the Handbook shouldn't be tried at home for any reason, the accuracy of the instructions make it possible to do so in moderate safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done, Thursday!","review":"This a great series for anyone with a wide range of reading background. As an English major, it was especially pleasurable to peruse. This is not a series you speed read, but cruise through."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst one of this series, yet I read it anyway","review":"I still cannot believe I read this entire book just to find out if Thursday finds Landen (I peeked and still read it!). What this means is that Jaspar Fforde can write, I just don't care for this novel. If he couldn't write worth beans, I wouldn't have finished the first chapter of The Eyre Affair. So what this means is that while I don't like this book, there is obviously something about it that kept me reading and I do have to say that the fourth book isn't nearly as bad as this one (yes, crazy me, I'm reading that one to find out if she gets Landen back, and then I'm done.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun romp in the world of Thursday Next","review":"I agree with the reviewer who criticized this book as being too long. It does drag in the middle. However, the plot is rich, and the characters are richer. There were more than a few surprizes. Thursday once again has to battle one of the diabolical Acherons, save the book world from destruction, and try to un-eradicate, or at the very least remember, her husband, Landen. She's also still dealing with the fall-out from her plot readjustment of Jane Eyre. The Well is another well-developed setting in Fforde's series. I can't wait till the next installment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happens!","review":"I really loved the first two books in Fforde's Thursday Next series. Therefore, I was extremely disappointed in \\"The Well of Lost Plots.\\" I literally could not finish it. I always have a pile of books by my bed and the call of another author was just too great. I abandoned this book on about page 150. I was mired in cleverness and inside book jokes. Other reviewers have noted that this book takes place almost entirely inside the world of books. I think that may be the problem. There's no connection to the characters in the Outland or the previous storylines. Also, I began this book within a day of finishing \\"Lost in a Good Book\\"; maybe I just needed a break. Thursday Next is my hero and I wanted to read more about her. I just couldn't maintain my interest in the plot -- or lack thereof. I'm going to try the fourth book in the series, upon the recommendation of one of the reviewers, but I found this book to be considerably less satisfying than the first two. Be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing world, disappointing read","review":"Yes, the Well of Los Plots is dazzlingly imaginative. But it delivers precious little of the Thursday Next we know and love from Fforde's previous two (delightful) efforts. Here she is little more than a projectile careening from one madcap scene to the next. The hilarity, too, is sadly superficial. Ultimately, the alternative world of The Well of Lost Plots is a joyless place, where literature is, really, just another dreary industrial product. This novel feels like an unwelcome digression from the REAL story, which, hopefully, will resume very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully imaginative book; good narrator on audio version","review":"Elizabeth Saztre does a very good job reading the audio version of this book. I especially enjoyed the voice of Miss Haversham.

The characters are clever, ingenious, warm, endearing and captivating - the multi-plots weave their way around the story line apparently writing themselves and the next book to come. All the while this delightfully engaging complexity dances around a mystery that can be solved by the attentive reader but still surprises. This is a book writers book to read.

As other people have noted, the arm you lift up to insert the can comes off WAY too easily - they should have made it to where you have to rotate it counterclockwise another 90 degrees or so before it can be removed. Also, after just a few months' use it does not open cans anymore, even while holding the can to it and helping it rotate the can. This is a horrible product and I would definitely not buy again. Wish another manufacturer made one that can fit under a lipped cabinet..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I ordered this can opener to replace an existing Black & Decker I had for over 15 years. I chose this one because of the price and it would work under my cabinets like my old one. When I got the opener, I was disappointed when using it, because the swing arm would routinely come undone (as if I were taking it off for cleaning) whenever I put the can up to be opened. I figured this a minor inconvenience and tolerated it because of the cheap price.Now, I cannot open a can. I make sure the arm is locked in place, and the motor runs, but I cannot get the blade to pierce the can. I have asked neighbors and friends to try, and nothing works. Unfortunately, I am past the return date for Amazon, and now have to deal with the company and warranty.I would not recommend this product to a anyone, since I have had problems with it from the beginning (because of the design), and now, after only 2 months, it is useless.

Couldn't find one locally so started checking online. The Proctor Silex 75400 had the best reviews. After using for 2 weeks I couldn't agree more!

I must say I disagree. I have found that it is difficult to use, that it fails to go into enough depth as a reference yet goes into too much depth as a revision work. The diagrams are poor, the pages flimsy (and in my edition in the wrong order!), and it is just far too heavy to carry around.

Also, this is aimed at like 15 year olds, maybe they shouldn't have it worded like it was a college textbook.

It was a gift from my mother, I'm guessing a not-so-subliminal message that I need some guidance in my worldly, money-grubbing life. So take my negativity for what it is. From the very first paragraph the arrogance and vanity seeping off the pages of this book leaves a bitter taste. While there might have been a good message beneath the condescension that I missed, I am suspicious that Mr. Bell overlooks the simple nobility of the average person.

My how things have changed! This kettle is incredible! So convenient and worry free! One of the nicest features is that it doesn't require close attention. When the water boils, it shuts off automatically. The handle stays cool so there isn't a chance of being burned. The pouring is easy since there isn't an entangling cord. And it holds up to 10 cups of water. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"The water heats really quickly. Having the cord attached to the base and not the pot itself is really convenient. My only complaint is that the lid is kind of hard to get off. I always have to struggle with it for several seconds before it pops off. I assume it was designed that way as a safety precaution so that the lid doesn't come off while pouring. But every time I pull the lid off, the water condensation from inside the lid and the walls of the pot goes flying all over me. But that's really only a minor inconvenience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast heating! Easy cleaning!","review":"Kettle heats up very quickly and I love the cordless portability.

I however hate the lid. You have to pull it off to fill the pot and it pours way to slow so you have to pull it off to pour hot water. The lid does not come off easy and when you finally get it to yank off you splatter boiling water on yourself and the counter. I bought the Philips HD4651 for my mother and I wish I had gotten the same one. I highly reccommend the Philips over this one because it has all the same great features plus it has an easy open hinge up lid and a bell goes off when it boils plus it has a filter. She used mine and agreed the Philips is a much better design at the same price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the counter space","review":"I've had the kettle for about a month now and use it daily for boiling water for tea and for pre-warming water for boiling pasta and vegetables. Only tricky thing about this unit is taking the lid off (I may have to shave off a little of the plastic so the fit isn't too tight, don't read too much into this inconvenience as I would make the same choice had I known beforehand). The kettle has a pretty small \\"footprint\\" so it doesn't take up too much counterspace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"Highly versatile item that heats water in a hurry and very economically too.

The main unit vibrates to the point where it rotates out of the slot and shuts down the machine. The top spindle came out of its slot and damaged the cover.The instructions are not very beginner friendly.

Based on a true story, a woman's husband plots to have her executed for adultery. It was not as simple as just a mere accusation, but rather a complex manipulation of events and people. Lies, blackmail and betrayal is the core of the story.The acting, dialogue, scenery, everything was realistic. The subtitles blended right in and I did not notice them after the first few minutes. It is a top rate film, very graphic in the end -- as it should be -- to impress on the viewer the horror of stoning. I had a difficult time watching it and don't recommend it for children.What happened was a travesty. I cannot believe stoning continues to be practiced in this day and age.

The reality is that this movie is extremely well written, the dialog is superb, the acting is excellent and the story is... gripping (I can't think of the right term as of this time).

Almost all of them have that unimaginative pounding beat that never changes throughout the entire 3 to 5 minutes of each track. I listened to it one time and realized that I never needed to hear it ever again. I put it up on Discogs for sale the following day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The crappest Hits remixed","review":"Not good for 80s sound fans.

I highly reccomend this book to all parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific book","review":"Baby 411 is a terrific book. It is really helpful for all the small and big questions that parents have about their newborns and infants. The authors explain things in a common sense and practical way.I really like the way the book is designed. It is very easy to find quick answers to what I am looking for. But it also gives detailed information for when I am looking for more explanations of things.I would recommend this book to any new parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good info. but not my style","review":"I bought this book to have an easy book to refer to for health and developmental questions about my baby. It has some good factual information (how much babies sleep at different ages, what illnesses need medical attention, etc). I don't agree with her opinions about sleep (using Ferber, not supportive of co-sleeping) and I think she gives too little attention to alternative ways of treating illnesses. If you are into attachment parenting and/or alternative medicine, don't buy this book! If you tend to follow whatever your doctor recommends and are OK with letting your baby cry it out, you'll probably find this book helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dad","review":"This book is great! I have been able to find almost everything I need to know about our son's health, growth and development in Baby 411.

I disagreed with much of her counsel, but it was her grating tone that really made me detest this book.This book is just Patient Obedience Training (must be why there are positive MD-reviews here) which surpised me me since the Fields usually encourage thinking outside the box and questioning professionals.My fave baby care book remains The Baby Book by Dr. Sears. He treats parents like adults, not just bigger children. Maybe to some pediatricians, everyone is a child. I really hated this book. Feh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refer to this book on a daily basis","review":"I think this book is great. I've read so many parenting books and this is the one I use most frequently. Granted, there are certain aspects of the book that I take with a grain of salt (like any other book I've read!!). The author takes a hard line on certain hot button issues such as vaccinations and sleep training - some people may not be comfortable with her opinion. But for the most part I think this book is on the money. I trust Dr. Brown's advice over the advice of my own pediatrician!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel prepared now!","review":"I haven't had my baby yet, but I just finished my first once-over of this book and am impressed. Now that I'm further along in my pregnancy, I haven't picked up a book about pregnancy itself in weeks. I'm looking ahead to \\"real life with baby\\", and this book was very informative. Watching my friends have babies, and years of baby sitting, has not prepared me for the daily issues of caring for my own baby like this book has! They cover everything from immunizations to umbilical cord care to feeding, bathing, etc. It's all probably the same advice my pediatrician would give, but I feel more reassured being prepared in advance, rather than waiting until my 2 month old has a fever at midnight and calling the on-call doctor with frantic questions.This is probably not the be-all-end-all of baby care books, but it is has been very handy to me. I would recommend it to any first time parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a worthless book!","review":"If I could give this book zero stars I would. This book is not helpful at all, in fact it gives blatent flase information that could be dangerous to your child! Do not buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for compassionate parents!","review":"I found the advice in this book to be too harsh. If you are at all into \\"attachment parenting\\", this book is not for you! It talks about babies as if they are objects to be trained instead of little human beings who need love. Yes, I believe in careful guidance, but the advice given here makes you feel that soothing or comforting your baby will turn him into a demanding monster! I read this book but then discarded it. I did not use any of the advice in this book, and my daughter is now a year old and happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. I was disappointed because it was from the publishers of Baby Bargains, a book I found indispensable while preparing for my baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby 411","review":"I specifically chose this book because I relied heavily on Baby Bargains. In addition, since I didn't read this prior to the birth of my son, I needed something short, to the point given the fact that I have a VERY limited amount of time to actually sit quietly and read. The information is there, it's to the point, and it's very useful information."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an arrogant author","review":"This book was beyond horrible. What a one sided opinion thus making it hard to make informed decisions. I rarely take the time to add my 2 cents and review a book, but save your money. On the other hand I loved Baby Bargains and I have no idea how both books could share a co-author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nights Free of Worry","review":"Any new mother or father who has spent their evenings pacing the floor worrying about their baby MUST have a copy of this book. Baby 411 is very reader friendly and extremely helpful for parents who find themselves laboring over whether or not their child's temperature/cough/bowel movements require a call to the doctor at 2 o'clock in the morning. While my husband and I are clearly able to determine an emergency from a non-emergency we are new parents and overly cautious at times. Baby 411 is an extremely helpful book with practical information that continuously puts us at ease. For the first 6 months of our baby's life this book held a spot on our coffee table and still isn't far out of reach. Baby 411 is the perfect gift for those expectant parents and grandparents in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource!","review":"This book is great for new parents. Good tips, easy to look up topics, and lots of practical advice and medical information. We have found it very useful with our newborn and now buy it for all of our friends who are expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Great!","review":"I have been a pediatric nurse for 24 years. I think this book is wonderful. It's thorough and a great resource for new parents. It's reader friendly and the advice is excellent. This is a must read for couples who feel overwhelmed with the every day pressues of caring for their new baby. If you are expecting a new baby, I recommend this book, it will make your first year not only fun but will give you the confidence needed in raising your new bundle of joy.Sarah"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Coffee table use....","review":"I am a new mother, and I admit that I did use this book...As a coaster. Dr. B. is opinonated, one sided and often wrong in her \\" reccomendations\\" I like the format, question and answer. But so much of the content was put my way or the highway, and did not allow for the other side. Several of them which have been posted before are just opinions, or from one side of the story, or study. Dr. Sears has gentler ways and more open minded books, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too One-Sided","review":"I am very disappointed with this book because it is one-sided. Other books present the facts for both sides of an argument so the reader can make an informed choice. This author obviously feels her very conservative view is the best and ridicules other choices. I couldn't believe the statements regarding birthing plans. Very demeaning to alternative views. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I like the format."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has been a godsend","review":"I am a 7 week old mother. This book has been like gold for us. Miss Hollis got some eye gook and so we looked up eye gook in the index and behold! it was there. The tips even worked. And when I talked to my pediatrician about the gook and the remedies, she concurred. I told her I got the info from that book and she hadn't heard of it, so I sang my praises.My husband even likes Baby 411. He tells anyone who will listen all about it. It is clear, concise and full of useful information. It even has a bit of humor thrown in there. I like that it tells you when you should worry, when you should wait and what the old wives tales are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for rice","review":"If you're planning on cooking rice, buy a regular rice cooker (looks kind of like a crock pot).

To be honest, I don't practice it regularly; however, most of my ab workouts that I do (which is usually about 2-3 times a week) have come from this book. The pictures are super helpful!

It is now a 'hope chest' item for each of my four children. I have asked for years at weddings, \\"Where is God in all of this?\\" This book is the answer.Martha Williamson sets the tone on page 26 (hardcover) when she says: \\"I believe, though, that finally every love story can be told only one way or the other: 'There were two people who did the best they could to love each other, drawing on their own strength and their own experience and their own intelligence.' Or: 'There were two people who asked God to create a place for them where their love could exist and be nurtured and protected by Him, even in the times when they were unable to sustain it themselves.'\\" She then proceeds to show how couples can and why they ought to invite God to be part of their relationship every step of the way.A must have book for bridezillas and everyone else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the planning books! This book is all you need!","review":"I received this book as a gift, and I know that it was God-sent. It reminded me that good luck traditions showed a lack of faith in me for God to handle everything. As if I needed luck! I have God, and He will provide blessings beyond everything else.Because I wasn't worried about getting all the traditions right so I'd have a happy marriage, I honestly enjoyed my wedding more than most I believe ever do!The producers of Touched By An Angel wrote this, and I can see why the tv show was on so long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a Christian book","review":"I was shocked when reading some of the things she wrote. Do not waste your time! This is not a Christian book...some things hinted at her being Jewish, but her values were not Biblical. She talked about they had sex until a time after the engagement and how they thought they were very admirable for abstaining for a short time before the wedding. There are many other books that are much more beneficial!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait For The Video","review":"What's most extraordinary about this self-proclaimed Jesus-girl of Hollywood is that she has finally come to believe her own myth. Her book, purportedly on the marriage of God and matrimony, is filled with more melo-dramatic hypocrisy than her inexplicably successful series, Touched By An Angel. Why over the course of these 7 years she has presumed we need her advice and wisdom is beyond comprehension. More insulting is her insistence that we find God, when cleary, she has done little in that area herself. (e.g. her marriage grew out of an adulterous affair) It is a poorly written, manipulative essay on what it's like to be Martha -- not a particularly bright or engaging woman. Truly, a dog of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait for the Video Rebuttal","review":"For the New Yorker who wrote the review entitled \\"Wait for the Video, is defintely not a Christian.

After 4 days of not being able to connect to the internet I had to go out and buy a Novatel pc card. I am a stock trader and can not afford to be down for 4 or more days.

Basically, this is as slow as dialup. I am in an area covered by Verizon with EV-DO Rev A service (large city). I called customer service. I was on the phone with them for almost 3 hours. The tech tried everything. His recommendation was to return the AirCard 595U under the 30 day guarantee. I really wanted this to work, so I went an spent $120 to upgrade by computer's memory from 1 GB to 2 GB, and that didn't help.

Have banged heads with Verizon ever since. When it worked it was slower than dial-up. I checked it with speed plexer. Spent hours on the phone with Verizon listening to excuses and running stupid checks on my computer. All they ever offered was to let me pay a big fee to stop getting ripped off. Instead I outsmarted them and suspended the service without billing. Every 90 days I have to re-suspend it which I will do forever if necessary.

But my 5G card got horrible overages (despite assurances that 5G is enough for any regular single person, unless they are streaming games or movies). No one would tell me what I was doing wrong or why it could be happening. The customer service was beyond terrible. No one knows what they are talking about and one gets transferred everywhere, dropped, etc. After 4 months with no resolution I cancelled my service. I really wanted it to work out, but it didn't. Only then did anyone call me back, but not to help with the problem, but to get me to stay as a customer. Empty apologies galore all the way up the ladder to corporate... no cancellation fee refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"I used this card for 3 days and returned it. Yes, it utilizes EVDO networking systems, but it has the speed of a dial-up modem in most metropolitan areas. Commingle this lousy speed, terrible latency, with outrageously stingy, but pricey service plans and you have a card ripe for the circular file!If you must get a card of this size and technology, go with the Pantech series or upgrade to a USB card and of course with another carrier. I can't believe I'm stating this, but Sprint actually offers a better deal with much more bandwidth.

And whatever happened to cross platform compatibility with FrameMaker...there are separate sections in instructions for Windows, UNIX, MAC (with more on UNIX and MAC). No examples on the CD, just more programs to sell (samples of other applications and FrameMaker). Could really have used a walk-thru, or even some interactive tutorials online on the CD. Many good caveats and several BTWs(makes me want to AVOID FrameMaker). May be good for intermediate user, but don't try using the FD book without some FM experience.

This book is a fine example of the realism that citizenship requires when asking questions about the worth of nuclear technology. It is a credible and scientifically literate example of the kind of debate that continues between the medical community and Federally funded scientists who live in a world where dissent to Federal policy is career-suicide.

It is clear after reading this book that they have very limited understanding of they subject matter. One thing is certain though: they really hate nuclear energy. And that's a shame too, since it is the only energy source that can rid us of our dependence on foreign oil, provide emission-free electricity, and produce the mass quantities of hydrogen that will fuel our future economy.This book is good if you're looking for examples of anti-nuclear propaganda, and is the only reason I gave it two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"as advertised","review":"I needed a replacement disk for one I lost and the item purchased was as advertised.

I used it daily for a few weeks to mix flaxseed oil and cottage cheese into a yogurt-like consistency (takes a couple minutes to get them really blended with no oiliness remaining), and then blend in berries and other fruit. I find the handle kind of big and uncomfortable to hold, and the whole thing a bit heavy if you need to mix for more than a few seconds. It was also NOT easy cleaning this sludge out of the blades after mixing. I've switched to a small food processor to make this concoction now. However, for other uses, these things weren't an issue and the blender works great.As far as storage goes, the blender is very top-heavy and with the cord coming out the top, I find that if I just stand it on the counter it tends to fall over easily.

Her book, Say Goodbye To Illness, is packed full of testimonials, some which include phone numbers and email addresses, which are truly miraculous. She also has a research foundation which has verified the effectiveness of her method, which is called NAET. Nambudripad's materials are much more comprehensive, and there are a lot more NAET practitioners around the country than there are BioSet practitioners.

You basically put all the cards in a pile, take turns turning them over real fast and whoever sees a set of 3 matching cards first grabs them quickly and keeps them. Whoever has the most cards at the end wins. The monsters look similar, so obviously it takes more time for my 5 year old to scout out a matching 3 than it does me. I basically have to sit there and pretend I don't see a set, so she can get some cards too. No fun if you have to throw the game everytime, and it's not much fun for her to just be looking for matches the whole game anyway. Spend alittle more and buy something better.

This game is a perfect example of why less is sometimes more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly Doll is fun for all ages!","review":"Aside from being just a fun game to play with kids the ugly doll characters make this simple game of matching really engaging for everyone! My son is an active kid - so getting him to actually sit down and play any kind of game to the end is not always an easy task. However, the short (and funny) descriptions of the characters immediately had him interested in collecting his favorites (part of the game, actually) and then counting his collection at the end (he usually wins).

As you are traveling through Texas, just look up the roadside markers in the area by city or county.

It makes a long trip across Texas, or just sitting in your living room, a good time.To the review that says it needed a map, yes it could have. It likely would have added a lot of pages and cost to this book. Can you imagine trying to have a detailed map for the backroads some of these markers are on?

I was disappointed to find that the book did not include any of those markers. I learned after-the-fact that the book contains only about 2,500 of the 11,000 historical markers in the state (the numbers are from memory, so may be off).So the book is not comprehensive enough to be a good reference guide, but it is also too reference-like to be readable as a book. It needs to be one or the other. If it is not going to be exhaustive, then there should be some editorializing, with actually fewer markers included (the most interesting or unique ones, with maybe a comment about each). But I guess that's just a different book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"review","review":"i was dissapointed.. i would like to see a book published with numbers for the markers so one could look them up and dred the marker by number. the closest thing i have found is an i phone app, Texas Markers, its really good.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy the Kindle Version","review":"I thought this sounded like a wonderful idea...driving along the highway one could look up towns and find out interesting historical things about the place and perhaps stop and check it out.

By this time, he is a famous and successful dancer and is married to a Catholic ballerina!A truly fascinating book. To read about Communist China in the 1970's from a first person account is as close as you can get to being there. Li makes his story so engaging and real that you come away with a feeling of triumph rather than pity or sorrow for his experiences.

There is a kind of respect reverence and decency in the whole tone and manner of the author.In one sense the story is a Horatio Alger one, of a poor boy who by hard work 'makes it' in the big world. But along with this it provides a description of life in the China of Mao's time, and a portrait of a single Chinese family which is sympathetic and rich.The loyalty to family members, to the place from which he comes , to his parents and siblings and teachers make this seem like a modern morality tale in which somehow virtue is rewarded.A clearly and honestly told most inspiring story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start - nice try, try again.","review":"Fuzzy Low-fi with too much synth, sounds good for one song, but gets a bit monotnous.

The title character King Lear disinherits his favorite daughter after she fails to flatter him when he asks each of his daughters how much they love him. King Lear is a foolish king who just goes with his first impressions and doesn't look deeper into people's words. The play takes place in England before the time of Merlin. The time period of the setting however is irrelevant to the play and the play could take place in any time period. King Lear is not an actual historical king, he is rather a king of British legend.The play teaches parents to beware children who love them superficially. Flatterers fool those who love to be flattered.The character King Lear is according to what I have heard, a rather difficult and demanding character to play for an actor.

A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"King Lear","review":"This Shakespeare play was a more difficult story line to follow. There were a lot of seperate plots happening at once. i did enjoy it however because Shakespeare keeps it interesting with lots of humor and violence. Shakespeare's fundamental elements of hidden identities and deception run rampant in the twisting and turning story line.The story follows the life of King Lear who makes a some what bizarre decision to split up his kingdom between his three daughters before he dies instead of after. He then banishes his youngest and favorite daughter for disagreeing with him and divides his land between his two evil daughters. Shakespeare tries to get the audience to have sympathy for Lear yet it is hard to do being that he brought all of the trouble he goes through upon himself.

This weekend I tried an experiment. I froze the buckets to both ice cream makers. I made a 2 quart batch of strawberry ice cream. I poured 1/2 the mixture into each bucket and then froze them side by side. This next part makes absolutely no sense to me, but this is what happened. The Rival ice cream never thickened to anything more than a slightly thick custard base. The stuff in the Donvier froze to the consistency of slightly less than a soft serve.

In the end, it simply doomed the show. There is nothing plausible about it. There are a lot of people who ask questions and many of them not only don't care what the government thinks about their opinions, they want to confront and challenge the authorities.

Arguments and action take place in a very fluid manner so you will not get bored. Good scenery as you might expect from most Hammer productions. Very nice clamshell packing with photos and extra information on the backside of the cover. In my opinion, main flaw of this movie lies in the idea of somebody creating and then using zombies as a slave working force in mining exploitation. Thus zombies are somewhat domesticated by a \\"master creator\\" and his collaborators, which remains a little bit unconvincing. The more classic idea of achieving eternal existence could have been used instead as the main argument to justify the actions of the bad guy.

The shaved ice is VERY hard to get out of the container without spilling any ice. VERY noisy for garage sales so I am looking for a new snow cone machine. It's easy to use and a kid could do it. Takes 5-6 minutes to shave ice for about 2 medium sized snowcones while other machines for about $10 more can make 10 snowcones. Overall, good machine for small events and beginners. Also, I wish their was a place to put the snowcones though but this is what you get for $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Deluxe about this one!","review":"This machine is horrible - it is difficult to turn on and off.

I took it apart twice and could not see a problem but when I started it back up it just whined loudly! I suppose if you were planning to make snowcones a couple of times each summer this would be ideal but, because the company apparently skimped on something to make this more durable, I ended up with landfill.

We didn't use it every day but for the time we used it we were satisfied. Having the enclosed tray to catch the shaved ice was perfect, hardly any mess. Especially since I saw the mess grandma's shaver made that had no tray to catch the shaved ice. But then it quit working altogether. The inside motor turned but the ice holder wouldn't. I called the company to describe the problem and to see if they had a replacement for that and they didn't. So I had a unit that was basically worthless junk. I tossed it and went for a completely different design. (What a waste of money.)

Nice quality, warm without being too heavy to sleep under. The only issue is that it is quite long. I don't have a footboard to help hold it on the bed and during the night, it tends to slip down and touch the floor (and it still comes up to my armpits). It's heavy enough that I have to actually sit up to pull back up where I want it. The navy blue dust ruffle didn't work for me either.

It covers main stream ideas such as liberal humanism, structuralism, psychoanalytic criticism, cultural materialism and even a hint of what stylistics is all about. Its goal is ambitious and in many respects it delivers too broad of an overview. However, Beginning Theory is a surprinsingly easy reading and a good intro to the above mentioned concepts.

Naturally this is a play and not the movie so there must be some allowances. Unfortunately the play mangles the story more than necessary. Also the actors have no charisma or pizzas. The vocal ranges including Julie's are pitiful. The characters and actors just do not mess. The original story was placed in Berlin (Viktor und Viktoria (1933.)) When Blake Edwards moved it to Paris he added his signature slapstick distraction. They had an opportunity to remove it for the play. Instead they just added more Keystone Cop type slapstick.

Thirteen years after the huge success of the film, Ms. Andrews re-creates her role for the stage (how many other actresses can play the same role, convincingly, 13 years later.) While Michael Nouri, in my opinion, is no match for James Garner, Tony Roberts is a delightful Toddy and Rachael York makes Norma her own. Lesley Ann Warren was BRILLIANT in the film version, Ms. York is equally as stunning in this production and was ROBBED of not only a Tony nomination, but the award itself.A must-have for all Broadway collectors, the shows flaws (primarily the book) can be easily overlooked due to the fabulous performances, brilliant technical achievements (sets being the most obvious) and terrific production values.Get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Musical","review":"I have watched this DVD often over the 5 years I've owned it.

The orchestra overpowered everyone, even Julie Andrews and diminished my emotional involvement in the music considerably. Just as it is difficult to translate dance to television and retain the essence of the joy of dance, so it is with Broadway. The two dimensions leave out so much.It was my pleasure to see the Broadway production right before Miss Andrews left it. It was a night of theater I cherish. I am grateful we have a record of it, even if flawed. In his defense, Tony Roberts acting was a greater joy live than with the camera close-ups of this production.

I love Victor/Victoria at the end of the show and I like Le Jazz Hot. Le Jazz Hot is probably the highlight of the show, but it is WAYYYYY different than the movie version. Some of the qualities that Julie had in her voice in this song kind of annoyed me though...I KNOW...I LOVE HER TOO, but she was singing oddly. I would suggest that all theatre lovers by this film.

It slides open rather than twisting, which is fine, other than it makes focusing a tad bit more difficult than it could be. To see distant objects clearly, you must extend the scope until it is about 1/4th of an inch from being fully extended. My only real complaint is that the clip on this pocket scope seems to be for decorative purposes only. When I tried to remove the scope from my shirt pocket, the metal clip popped off.

Also, it would be nice if you could twist the scope closed rather than just push it in - it will just slide right open again if you hold the scope upside down.

The songs reflect his classic mix of soul, R&B;, rock, blues, a little Irish, a little jazz, a little country--a lot of vintage Van. The liner notes include lyrics, so you can sing along--but don't do that behind the wheel, or you may wind up in that car wreck after all--with Van Morrison on your tape (or CD) deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Van For The True Fan","review":"Dissing Van for sounding like Van -- a tack taken by some reviewers of this CD -- is like whining that Babe Ruth was one dimensional because all he did was hit home runs, or that Pablo Picasso's portraits didn't look like real people. Van is what he is. As anyone who's listened to even just one of his albums can tell you, Morrison abhors hypocracy more than any other human frailty. Pretense and dishonesty are simply not in the man's musical nature. Why some \\"fans\\" would expect or want some kind of mid-life musical metamorphasis from him escapes me. Down The Road is Van Morrison doing what he has always done best: distilling his own special blend of blues, rock, country and jazz to near perfection. This CD doesn't have a klunker on it and is solid evidence of why people continue to flock to Van after all these years. Don't be dissuaded by the nit-pickers and nay-sayers. If you like Van, my prediction is you'll like this CD -- a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fork in the Road","review":"What can a devotee expect from the man who has some thirty albums to his credit? To constantly reinvent yourself after three plus decades could only be done by Van the Man.No one has the chops to reinvent Ray Charles save for Van. His version of Hoagy Carmichael's \\"Georgia\\" has moments of brilliance where Van shows he still has \\"fire in the Belly.Shuffle tunes, \\"Down the Road\\", \\"Choppin Wood,\\" and theexceptional, \\"Hey, Mr.DJ\\" showcase Van's penchant for saxophones and strings and organ. His roots are in the blues and this Road takes us there.New Orleans is given its due with a lyrical interpretation and solo by famed clarinetist, Acker Bilk.Probably not his \\"best\\"album but certainly worth the purchase.....the Irish/Celtic/Angry/Blues veteran has returned to a mellower pathway.Good to have a new album with that splendid voice that evokes nuances and phrasing like no other......repetitive and growling and mellow and as we have also come to expect, musicians who complement this icon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The venerable Van Morrison is truly now back on top!","review":"Van's latest catalogue of blues and R&B oriented songs are solid and wonderfully crafted. Van's rendition of \\"Georgia On My Mind\\" is by far my favorite track on the CD. Van's opening tune \\"Down the Road\\" is an excellent introduction to the CD - - the song's energy will excite the fresh listener to want to hear more. \\"Hey Mr. DJ\\" is a 50's style rock-n-roll tune with the type of character embodied by Van's predecessors. This CD is no doubt an excellent edition to his awe inspiring catalogue of music; it will certainly win over a whole new generation of fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoned In","review":"Unfortunately a very mediocre effort from Van. Much of this disc sounds like filler, and indeed some tracks date back years, having been left off earlier albums. When compared to recent masterworks like \\"Hymns To The Silence\\", and \\"Too long In Exile\\" and even \\"Back On Top\\", (while not a classic), they are all much better than this offering. Truly sounds like Van is bored and phoned it in. I'm sure the next disc he makes will be miles ahead of this contract filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Down The Road To Classic R&B","review":"Van Morrison's fascination with American rhythm and blues music infuses his latest album with the melodic soul of the best of his earlier work (\\"Jackie Wilson Said\\"). Morrison's own compositions stand up well while his cover of \\"Georgia On My Mind,\\" is a highlight. There isn't a weak track on this entire album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oooo-Weee","review":"I bought this CD as an impulse. Being a Van fan from way back I knew that was a gamble. I hit the jackpot. The first two songs sounded fine. 5 seconds into the third, Steal My Heart Away, I had goosebumps. A simple song, yet the Irish Soul Man was quietly electrifying. Any Van Morrison fan will love this CD. It has no real weak songs. Not quite at the level of his greatest albums, but I would give it 9 out of 10 stars on that scale. Van is mellow but upbeat, wistful but not melancholy. Great horn arrangements, which add so much to his songs. A good variety of different types of tunes, including Georgia on my mind which is given a signature VM treatment. Do yourself a favor and buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Granted, I'm overly critical","review":"While I enjoy Van's up-front horn based blues arrangements (better than most of what's out there) it's his Celtic, folky, rocky, troubador, soul-searching work that I've always loved the most. This CD let me down a little in that respect; granted there are some good things here. (I'll probably \\"burn\\" the non-horn offerings onto some \\"best of the last 10 years\\" Van CD). I still think he's got a few Poetic Champions...left in him as I continue to enjoy growing old with this unique artist and his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect book for someone who has lost a pet","review":"This is the best pet loss book I have ever seen. Most books on pet loss are somewhat scientific, or they read like a textbook describing grief and bereavement. This book is very different- it not only explains loss and grieving, it has self- help ideas and exercises to help you work through the grief. This book is sweet, thoughtful and poignant, and I would recommend it to anyone going through the sadness of losing a beloved pet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps Works as a Textbook, But Not for Those Grieving","review":"I ordered this book and waited for it eagerly, based on \\"Search Inside\\" reading I did on Amazon. I hoped the chapter devoted to guilt experienced by \\"animal guardians,\\" as the author considerately calls pet owners, when euthanasia or an accident precipitates a pet's death would speak to me. Therefore I was surprised to find the book more clinical than inspirational. I also found it emotionally distant from its subject...which perhaps is to be expected, considering that it was written by a psychologist. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone suffering from deep grief over a lost pet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lupus Underground was way overdue","review":"Well-written, well-researched, well-reasoned and at times, more than a little funny. I think this book is a must for all lupus sufferers frustrated with currently approved FDA treatments. We're lucky that Mr. DeBartolo, a great investigative journalist, got sick. The 3 years of research he did to find a treatment that worked for him - UVA1 photo therapy - benefits us all. What I do not fully understand is why the work of Dr. McGrath at LSU has been so \\"long-ignored.\\" Is it really because the big drug companies can't make a dime off his work? Makes me want to move to Canada! Especially useful (and informative) is the book's extensive reference of UVA1 lupus therapy research. Thank you, Mr. DeBartolo.

In the traditional of exceptional young adult fantasy writers, Okorafor-Mbachu's debut novel represents the next generation of fantastical heroines. Okorafor-Mbachu creates a world where nothing is exactly what it appears to be, teaching us all that anything is possible and a young girl is capable of the wondrous. I urge every parent to share this treasure with their children and everyone else to share the fantasy too. Trust me folks, there is a lesson to be learned here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I read another book by this author, Akata Witch, and was so impressed that I bought this one right away. It did not disappoint! The world Okorafor created is so lush and the Africa-based setting was really well developed. Everything is plant based, even computers, and it makes for an interestingly fantastic world. I loved Zahrah's transformation from a shy, frightened girl to proud and courageous young woman. It was also refreshing that the relationship/romance was downplayed. Zahrah and Dari are just best friends - it doesn't need to be more than that. This isn't a romance, it's an adventure.I very much liked this book, but the e-book transfer left something to be desired. Tons of typos, some of them recurrent (Dan instead of Dari was a particular problem). There were eventually so many typos that I couldn't highlight and submit them anymore.

The color is important in helping one get a feel for the environment.

This collection doesn't offer solutions because I don't think there are any conclusive ones at the moment. But you do get to see a great deal of compelling imagery providing food for thought and a real sense of being there.

I spent a year there in the 2nd I.D., and saw plenty of what the Koreans had to offer, especially in Itaewon (everything on the street sold for 8 dollars). But the quality of the picture was the same as the first release, and it is not full screen. There is a letter-box, but is it just not the scale of The Robe. The story has been fleshed out alot, and we get to see all the characters more fully developed. I recommend buying this copy if you liked the original offered by Belle and Blade. The weapons and Russian armour leave nothing to be desired. Where the producers found T-26 tanks, BA-32 Armoured Cars, and what looked like a BT-7, is beyond me! The Finns also had a Swedish AB Bofors anti-tank gun! This film is one of the most authenitc WWII films ever made, right down to the Artillery and tracers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"This is a great movie if you want to learn more about Finnish history and culture.

Portraying war and individual emotions to the extent that you feel it to the bone. Showing the Finns mentality that they would not give an inch and even would die to rescue their horse from being left behind to be eaten by the Russians.No Holywood stunts or un-realistic effects that plague most if not all movies originated in the USA.There is only one war movie I like better and that is the black & white movie Tuntematon Sotilas (Unknown Soldier) and perhaps the color recast that was released a few years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY THE BEST WAR FILM EVER, BAR NONE!","review":"I saw this at a film festival years ago, expecting little, and was just awed by it's unembellished view of war. I've since seen it again on video and this has only reinforced the fact that in the years since, having seen many, many other documentaries and war films, this still remains the best. Superb characterisation, pace, and tight directing. Never short of action; it doesn't ever become maudlin, boring, or jingoistic. The Actors are regular people, just like the soldiers who fought in this War; and the desperation and determination of tiny Finland holding back Russia is palpable and made utterly and frighteningly credible.Many have tried to make the \\"definitive\\" war movie, but none have succeeded like this Director with this Film! Peckinpah comes close with \\"Cross Of Iron\\". Purely and simply a benchmark for War films, and a Masterpiece of filmmaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter War (VHS)","review":"This movie will appear to die-hard war movie fans since it has lots of realistic action. The Russo-Finish War is not known by many people; this movie does a good job by showing the viewer how lopsided the numbers were between the two armies. My only gripe with the movie is the quality of the tape. Quite often it has a grainy look to it that was annoying. I could tell immediately that this was not a big bucks US production."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie","review":"for all people who are for gun control should watch this movie,had the finnish not had the civilan guard the russians would have run right over them.to this day all people from the age of 18 to 52 must serve and keep weapons as i understand it.it's also a time in our history were we should hang our heads in shame because we stood by when they asked our help and we refused.a great movie for a courages country.my deepest respect to the finnish.i also recommend reading the book The Winter War"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"This is a very good movie about Finnish troops trying to repel the massive Soviet invasion of Finland in the early part of World War II. It has many tense, gut-wrenching battle scenes and some interesting, admirable characters. Some parts are almost heart-stopping, including outnumbered Finnish troops watching huge numbers of Soviets attacking their trenches, and Finns going out in the open to stop the Soviet tanks. Other scenes of soldiers visiting their families behind the lines are also effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very interesting pic, abysmal DVD from Belle and Blade","review":"To make it short: The picture is very interesting, a must see for every war movie fan. Especially the fighting on the huge-scale sets including vintage russian armour (even a flamethrower tank is roaming the battlefield!) is VERY impressive.However, the DVD edition from a company or label \\"Belle and Blade\\" is one of the worst I have ever seen. The picture quality is sub-VHS Standard, the sound in a flat stereo, the english subtitles are totally oversized and not removable, there are no extras at all - in one word, you'll get pure... for your hard-earned Euros (or Dollars).

Its cool to see him up close doing his thing, but the tablature print in the accompanying booklet is microscopic and there aren't too many examples of his famous techniques. He spends more time on his jazzier side than he should, and gives too little focus to his use of double stops and barely speaks of his chicken' picken' and use of his fingers, perhaps his best technique.

Everything sticks to the non-stick surface. I seasoned it as directed. Even bacon & sausage stuck to it. I even tried using cooking sprays first, but things till stuck to it. I called Rival & they replaced it with a new one. I didn't even have to return the first one; they told me to throw it away. Well, the replacement wasn't any better.

Secondly, does it really matter if Carson assistants contributed under his guidance (if that be the case)?I'm a big fan of Marshall McLuhan and Carson, so I was pre-disposed to a welcome reception of this volume, and indeed I feel it delivers the goods. At times Carson's designs appear perhaps unnecessarily minimalist, until one considers what must be his reverence for the top billing - McLuhan's probes.

It is safe to say that no other book about Hawaii surpasses it in fascination. Much of the charm of Isabella Bird's writing is due to her use of personal letters for conveying her experiences and her impressions.

In fact, the only thing that kept me reading [despite the fact that I had over-paid for it, and gawddamn it I was gonna TRY and get my money's worth] was to skim through and shake my head at the many places where they went wrong, where they could have easily went right!

The tone never felt right, and it seemed like the author didn't have many ideas. This is an odd example, but one thing that made the book feel thin is that the illustrations (quite nice, btw) were captioned with a direct quote from the text, not even a rephrase - no additional jokes were written.I don't want this review to come off as mean spirited or anything.

The musical score was grating and way too distracting during the entire show, especially since it was too loud to tune out.But the real problem in my view was the total lack of chemistry among the crew, even after all 13 episodes, as opposed to the almost immediate amazing chemistry among the cast of other Sci-Fi series like Farscape or Firefly. I never cared enough about any of the \\"Crusade\\" members to root for them, maybe because they themselves never convinced me they actually cared about each other, be it as actors and/or characters.Storywise, the series had so much potential.

I wanted to see more about Galen and what he was all about, but it never happened.I feel that if the network had continued with the show, it would have had a great run. Maybe not as stellar as the original B5, but good in its own right. For its short run, though, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killed in its prime","review":"I really enjoyed these 13 episodes, and wish that JMS had a chance to write this story the way he wanted. He did so well with Babylon 5, why couldn't the studio just trust his judgement?"},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS SHOW SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALLOWED AT LEAST 2 SEASONS","review":"This was a very good show. It was not given a chance to develop into its full potential. I do not know how they were able to tell after just 13 episodes that it was not good enough. I was a big Babylon 5 fan that had never heard of this show until years later. I think it is a good continuation of the story of the Babylon 5 universe. The one complaint I have about the DVD is that it is cheap. The packaging is good, but there are almost no extras on the DVDs. There are only 2 commentaries and the extras at the end are very small."},{"rating":"2","title":"TNT should have left JMS do what he wanted","review":"This would have been a great series if TNT had allowed it to continue. JMS is definitely one of the best writers/producers working now. While the story is a bit fragmented, it was intended to be the leadin to the real story (listen to JMS's commentary). The music wasn't as good as it could have been (I think I would have done a better job), but Christopher Franke is a hard act to follow. It was a most beautiful superposition of D&D into a scifi setting - you have the thief, the wizard, the warrior getting info from a not always forthright magic item, the quest... need I say more? Most recommended. Bad TNT for pulling the plug and not allowing this to be sold to, say, scifi channel so it could conitnue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusade - The Complete Series","review":"This series probably deserved 5-stars. My rating of 4-stars is because I felt like I was left hanging. If you are a \\"true\\" sci-fi fan, you find yourself wanting the series to continue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"Terrible, awful, the acting (what acting!?!) was amaturish, the plot, cartoon-like. What a waste, a terrible waste. Save your money, your time, your energy. Buy the Jetsons - you'll at least have a plot to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNL Parody or Science Fiction?","review":"This series was sooo bad, I thought I was watching a SNL parody with bad lines, corny plot, and terrible acting. Please don't spend money on this DVD, if you absolutely must rent it from Netflix and spend the 20 bucks on something good like Firefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection of SF series that ended too quickly.","review":"I remember this series when it originally aired. This collection of DVD's is well produced and was a great bargin for the price. This series only lasted one season but was interesting to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"The year is 2267. The name of the place isn't Babylon 5.","review":"In 2267 the earth is faced with the Drakh virus as it threatens to wipe out humanity. Captain Gideon leads an experimental ship across the known universe and beyond in search of a cure.This series is pretty good. I you are expecting something similar to Babylon 5 then you'll be a little disappointed. This show has a very methodical feel to it. Each episode has a different story line. The ship ends up at a different planet each episode and searches for a cure to the plague. The acting is mediocre. The special effects are pretty good, and the soundtrack is just ok. All in all this series isn't for everyone. I kinda liked it, but was disappointed at the same time. If you're a Babylon 5 fan then you should give it a chance. But it's probably a gamble."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could erase Crusade from my brain!","review":"That seems harsh, but although I liked Babylon 5, the series started to go downhill in Series 5, which was a bit incoherent and felt slapped together. I understand the underlying reasons for this.But Crusade is much worse, in my opinion. It is as bad as Andromeda, except Andromeda was allowed to linger on for years.I consider myself a Bablyon 5, but if you are honest enough with yourself to admit the decline in quality starting in series 5, then Crusade will just make you irritated and annoyed.Go buy The Lost Tales, those are actually nice sci fi stories with good acting and special effects - as well as familiar characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after 8 episodes","review":"Am a big fan of Babylon 5 series and the books.Crusade starts off with one of the strongest story lines ever,Earth has been infected with a plauge, everyone will be dead in 5 years, captain Gideon here's a ship and a crew - go out and find a cure before its too late! Wow! great start.But episode 1 collapses 2/3rds of the way through starting with a lame puff ball fight with some Drakh soldiers and an even more odd silent space battle.Episodes 2-8 are barely watchable. Just filler, no furthering of plot line.I stopped after 8 episodes and traded the set at the used DVD store for a copy of the new THING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crusade ? (yawn)","review":"I purchased this series based on the reviews I read. Now I think whoever wrote them had to be thinking about something completely different. This had to be the worst science-fiction series I have ever seen. The writing was sloppy, story lines confusing and special effects and props/ models very amateurish. The first few episodes were very difficult to get through. They made almost no sense at all. Subsequent episodes smoothed out and started to show some improvement as the characters developed a little, but overall I found it to be a complete waste of time and money. Sad too, as I have seen the actors in other roles and they were all quite talented and convincing, but in this series not so. As a result I'd have to conclude the problem had to be the script. No small wonder the series was cancelled. The pleasant surprise was on the last DVD when I found there were only two episodes instead of four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad","review":"This show had everything that was wrong with B5 (bad acting, bad effects) without everything that made B5 good (great arcs and a scattering of interesting characters)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old but not good","review":"I love old sci-fi, but this was not very good and we only have watched the one episode so far. I plan on watching it all in the future, but I have a tough time recommending anyone spend their hard earned dollars on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusade: The Complete Series (DVD)","review":"I have had the VHS version since it first came out. But I no longer have a functioning VHS player. I would have preferred a BluRay version with 5.1 sound, but it looks like DVD with stereo is it for this now classic Sci-Fi spin off from Babylon 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never given a chance to shine.....","review":"I wish I could have known who to write to at TNT when this show was canceled. It was a perfect B5 sequel. The characters and premise were sound. Peter Woodward, son of actor Edward (Equalizer) Woodward fame, portrayed a technomage. It was actor Gary Cole's devil's advocate to the Draka world. I wish this show cold have played out. This collection proves that the decision makers have no idea how to handle good science fiction. It's worth your time and effort to see this program. If you are a B5 or science fiction fan, buy this show. You won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS Great!","review":"I bought the entire Babylon 5 series, then purchased this set that follows the other series. It's a SHAME that 'Crusade' wasn't extended several more years. The producers had a very Good extension going, but the television network dropped the ball ---- too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crusade","review":"There is always more to a story and we all know how good Babylon 5 was. Crusade had the potential to be better, if only it had been given half a chance to grow and mature into that potential. Crusade opens many doors that simply have not been explored, steering away from the core group of 'races', introducing ancient cultures that any archaeology buff would tell you is a thrill to explore. Personally I loved the series and I wish it had been given the chance to run for five seasons, if it had I would have those in my collection too and they would be well watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good except when it is not","review":"My husband and I are big Babylon 5 fans. We loved most of this spin-off series. Sadly, there is no real ending and we never know what happens. A couple of the epidodes had us looking at each other and saying \\"Huh?\\" But overall it was a fun addition to the Babylon world. I wish they had been able to finish a few more seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!!","review":"I am a big fan of the B5 series and this spinoff, \\"Crusade\\".I was very disappointed to find that the \\"Crusade\\" DVD set was done in \\"pan-and-scan\\" 1.33:1, not in the widescreen 1.85:1 format the series was originally in. Unlike the DVD sets for B5 which all are in widescreen, enhanced for Hi-Def sets and are delightful on a 70\\" widescreen, the picture quality of the \\"Crusade\\" DVD set leaves a lot to be desired.I wish I knew why these are not widescreen and enhanced. Hopefully the widescreen set will be produced for the fans.For a glimpse of the original widescreen, watch the openning credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"This dog does not run....","review":"I was going to write an eloquent and long-winded review.Forget it. This show bites.The ideas, acting, and scenarios are bad. NO suspension of disbelief. Poor set-up, bad history, and doesn't fit well with the rest of the B5 universe as previously set forth. JMS railed against the changes force on him by Turner's people - some of those changes were actually the BETTER ideas put forward in the show (the mystery box, changing character dynamics, etc).Most of the episodes contain at LEAST one fall-down laughing BAD moment. When you get to the Joan-of-Arc-channeling terrorist or the Mr. Kitty episode, you will know what I mean.If you are a B5 fan, AVOID THIS LIKE THE PLAGUE. It was actually DIMINISH your appreciation of the B5 franchise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"I am a big fan of the original series even with the 80s level of CG.But I did not like this series at all.

It is the worst of John Tesh, Jon Schmidt, et al mixed into one gauzy mess with far too much synthesizer. If the electronic Jetsons-organ in Emerald Fantasy doesn't make your teeth hurt, you're deaf.

It turns out he has serve acid reflux as well as food allergies including milk and soy as discussed in this book. As parents who have not been to med school we still feel lost (and it has been a little over a year) when it comes to the medical specialists on this topic but this book really helped shed some light when we really needed.

Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"This is a good introduction to the problems of acid reflux, stomach motility disorder, and so called \\"colic.\\" It explains how to determine if your infant has GER or GERD (gastric acid reflux.) It gives you examples/stories of other mother's experiences with their children. It helps you understand the condition and gives you knowledge and good questions that you can take to the pediatrician. It also helps you identify if you need to go see a pediatric GI specialist. I highly recommend it. Quick read as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Just Colic....","review":"If you are tired of hearing your pediatrician say this, this is the book for you. After three (yes, three) babies with reflux, Dr. Vartabedian's book was like a breath of fresh air. It is easy to read and very informative on the subject of infant reflux. I thought I knew everything I needed to know about reflux after living through it twice before, but learned a lot more from \\"Colic Solved\\". The book has great advice on dealing with the medical community, medication, feeding, and handling of your \\"bundle of misery\\". It is also very validating for parents who have lived through 12 hours and 46 minutes of consecutive screaming and useless bottles of Mylicon. If you live in or near Houston, Dr. Vartabedian is also a wonderful pediatric GI. Hang in there, and read this when you are not sleeping :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for my friend","review":"My dear friend was at the end of her rope because her darling 1 month old daughter would spend most of her time screaming her lungs out.

This program discussed programming more than the technology that was involved, but even so is was very interesting. Due to the novelty of television and the inordinate amount of resources it took compared to radio the medium was not used much during the war, when everything had to be justified as being vital to the war effort.Some very rare footage (recovered from East German archives) and interviews of surviving participants in German TV makes this a must if you want to learn more about early television."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"This is a pretty poor product.

He apparently plays every instrument here, such as guitar, bass, synthesizer, moog, mellotron, sitar and drums. This six track effort is what I would best describe as 'dream-like progressive space' music for those who seek it. Really liked the title cut \\"Dreamer\\", the superbly tripping \\"Dealer McDope\\", the out-there \\"Nervenlachmung\\" and Pink Floyd's \\"Baby Blue Shuffle In D Major\\".

The good martial arts don't come until the last few scenes, and are often too fast to appreciate.All in all, a cheesy film with a cheesy storyline, with just about acceptable martial arts. For better martial arts try the 'Once upon a time in China' series, or 'romeo must die'. For better storyline, try ANYTHING else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plot, Choppy Video, but it works for me....","review":"I liked it. The plot was interesting. It has some of the classic Chinese wire stuff. Some good fight scenes. Dialogue is good. Too much of the \\"f\\" word for me, even though it does add to the characters.

These men are abused by their commanders, made to dig useless trenches under fire, and sent into a final suicidal mission. Their enemies are everywhere. This film is based on a novel by Heinz G. Konsalik and co-written by him. With unflinching realism it portrays these soldiers, their commanders, and the corruptions of the home front.

The only ones that reallty fit the character they played were Kopaka, Thau, Vakama, and Hahli. Everyone else just wasn't the right voice for the job, especially Lewa, though he is saved by the actor's great depiction of how he talks (like using terms such as \\"high-flying\\" or \\"wind-walking\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's very nice!","review":"This is a nice movie and I would recommend it to anyone. I'm a...er...veteran Bionicle fan, and I was impressed of how the movie stayed with the story. I enjoyed it, although I noticed that there a lot of \\"rocks-falling-and-people-running-and-screaming-everywhere\\" scenes. The computer graphics are very very good, but sometimes some scenes look strangely sped up a bit or shaky. The biggest annoyance in the movie was probably Lewa's voice. It seemed way too fake, and he said things like \\"windfly\\", \\"footwalkin'\\" and \\"quickspeed\\" too much.I loved the commentary because it was really interesting. The Behind-the-Scenes are very nice too.It's a good movie for everybody, even my 4-year-old brother demanded to see it again as soon as the credits started rolling, so it's not THAT scary.

It is a very awesome movie, with plenty of action, and lots of the familiar Matoran saying, \\"Unity, Duty, Destiny\\". It is the first Bionicle movie and it is AWESOME! I rate it 4 stars because, it is a very awesome movie, but I have heard that Bionicle 2 movie will be better. And nothing is better than five stars!From a true Bionicle fan, Nicholas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless and Nonsensical, but Well Done","review":"I'm at a loss to explain the 5 star ratings this film got. It literally has no plot. Tons and tons of expository dialogue to explain the \\"mythology\\" (so that your 5 year old feels justified in demanding that you buy all the \\"characters\\") and \\"glory shots\\" of things getting blown up and characters running and screaming. But it has so much jargon that if you're not already familiar with the characters, the plot will make no sense. My son's Dad and I have watched it with my 6yo son (who admittedly loves it even though he can't explain what it's about either) and we still can't discern an actual plot.Harmless fluff, I guess, but my money would have been much better spent on other, much better videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greg Farshtey, no story, no duh!","review":"Greg Farshtey must go down in history as the worst storyteller for boys ever. His books are ponderous, and my 7-year-old, tho he's watched this repeated times, enjoys poking fun at all the holes in the plot, setting, characterizations, etc. Put it together with the other Bionicle movies, and the plot holes are as wide as - well, the Makuta! He enjoyed Bionicles a few years ago, but became bored with them, tho. Why? Lack of a comprehensible storyline to play with them! Lego's switch to \\"Hero Factory\\" - aka Bionicle remake - is equally terrible.

The basics: It's about 200 pages, B&W, with the original Japanese panel ordering (i.e. the whole thing is backwards). It's cooking manga, completely over the top, filled with bizarre characters making even more bizarre foods. And it's a blast. It's unabashedly an Iron Chef rip-off, with this volume taking place entirely during a cooking tournament (with some flashbacks to the chefs involved in training). It's breezy, fun, and passes the \\"would my significant other enjoy it?\\" test with flying colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books like this one is what makes history boring.","review":"I brought this book thinking it was be an insight into the 1930s,but it is a dull book written for children.

I was arrestd by what I heard.All the songs are nice, but two cuts in particular usher me straight into God's throne room; they are so hauntingly beautiful: \\"Jesus What A Beautiful Name\\" and \\"Jesus Name Above All Names\\" The soloist's voice is so pure and unpretentious she sounds like an angel.

I thought I was getting something along the Bossa Nova line. Whatever new tack she is trying to venture on - forget it. No creativity. I've tried to like it and I can't. There is something lacking in this album: the arrangements, the selection of instruments, the singing style is almost uninspired. Astrud Gilberto at her worst is better than this.

It might help Marisa to find new collaborators, rather than rely so heavily on the likes of Arto Lindsay and Arnaldo Antunes. Still, Marisa is Marisa and still deserves the accolades given to her in the musical guide \\"The Brazilian Sound,\\" which writes that Marisa has \\"a voice that can be tender or precise, or slinky and sensuous\\" and that she is taking \\"the legacy of the MPB generation into the future.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"brazil has given us the next joni mitchell","review":"Marisa Monte is the real deal! one the most amazing records i have ever heard. a hauntingly beautiful record, drippiing with emotion and mood. i think i'm in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"great brazilian artist","review":"This cd is kind of like bossa nova pop of some sort.

I like it: it is full of love and passion and, at the same time, sweetness and sorrow... Fortunately she has been evoluting since her last album, i don't want her to change, but I don't want her albums to get repetitive... Despite it all, her voice is still tender and accurate and her producer is still worried about its instrumental influences (from the piano, guitars, bass to brazilian textures) what makes this album a \\"must have\\" if you are a fan or a simple admirer of soft but good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanted","review":"Had 2 of her previous albums and loved this one, although less traditional Brazilian and more pop than their previous ones.

On a few occasions the camera does not show what her feet are doing which I found made it difficult to get the traveling movements in particular, just right. Overall a great resource especially if your a fan of Rachel Brices unique style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Super good! and very challenging, but it is a good challenge.

Although these DVDs are not for beginners, I could definitely keep up. Some of the dance terminology was foreign, but I did not have a hard time figuring out what she meant. I am not a dancer, but I love to dance. I was a little out of shape, but after doing the yoga and leg strengthening drill, my legs feel so much stronger--there is even visible muscle definition after only a few times doing the drill. My back is stronger and my dance technique has gotten smoother. The yoga is kind of difficult as I've never really practiced any yoga poses. The leg drill definitely got me sweating. If I had a complaint, it would be the music that her routines are to set to.

Not interesting to watch. Money wasted..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something for everyone","review":"What I like the best about this DVD is it gives you a bunch of pieces to mix and match in a way that suits your needs. From beginner to expert, from a half an hour to three hours, drills to conditioning to choreography, you can mix and match sections to meet your needs. It is an excellent supplement to in class work. I belong to a troupe, and I use it to make my drilling and conditioning work i do on my own more interesting and effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish choreography music was better","review":"Other than my music complaint (save whispers song. I love that one) this is a SENSATIONAL DVD. packed with lots of information and fun.I only labeled it a 4 star because I can't stand one of the choreography music choices that sounds like a big-top circus. It's all personal taste of course, I had no fun learning it. I am glad however she chooses a fast tempo song and a slow tempo song so you can be snakey like she.I still think this is a DVD worth purchasing for the educational value and love of RB.I love that she adds mini classes which include how to time music aka music theory, and yoga for back bends. Everything else has been said by previous reviewees as to contents. Thank you, Rachel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"The footage definitely gives you your money's worth. Wow! Over two hours of dance and over an hour of yoga. It isn't easy. Not for whiny beginners. I'm a beginner, but I was willing to work through the video executing one move at a time. If you're a beginner who loves a challenge and has patience with yourself, you'll enjoy this DVD.Intermediate dancers will surely learn a lot and gain useful techniques for a professional polish. I will get great mileage from this DVD and it will serve as a permanent reference as I advance in my dance skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!","review":"After about a year of basic belly dance instruction, I wanted to bring up my skills to the next level.

I think this is a great video for anyone that wants to belly dance not just Tribal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this style of Bellydance!","review":"I love Rachel Brice's Arms and Posture Dvd, and had to own this one too! I think it is a very good example of Rachel Brice's style of bellydance, and even if you enjoy more traditional and less fusion styles, the movements and control of body she teaches can be used for any style of dance. There is a slower and a faster dance, and there are live performances of each dance available on the dvd. She breaks down the movements and shows you how to put them all together. It isn't a dvd for a beginner, but if you have the basics down, it is a very nice dvd to have in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the greatest bought it to fix another one of the same due to data left in the old hardrive","review":"not the greatest bought it to fix another one of the same due to data left in the old hardrive.

The play is interesting read and is probably fun to perform, but the movie screenplay is just so much better in terms of characterization, dialogue, etc. In addition, the decision to break the play up into acts is, in my view, a mistake; quite obviously, this play should be performed in one continuous act (since the movie is only 90 minutes, this doesn't seem impractical).Read the play, but also see the movie!

At first it was just a little off, but after repeated use (a few times)I found that it doesn't get any hotter than 300 degrees! Much less than the stated 375 degrees. So unless you want to have greasy boiled food, do not buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"read and maybe it will work better 4 u?","review":"I have used this fryer for months.I have had success because i know the lid locks/removes.I fry food quickly and do not let it sit and smoke to overheat. I keep it clean. I know that if you want to fry some type of \\"peculiar\\" food or \\"it doesn't get 375\\" as some say that you need to be aware of factors such as \\"which oil should i use\\" because many oils lack the chemistry to heat beyond a certian degree! I like peanut oil as will give highest temp. Filter and other factors are consumer responsibility and will effect the machine performance.Information i hope is helpful as often reviews turn off some when product is great and user is off.Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for large items","review":"I have so many problems with this item, i don't know where to start. First the seals on the lid try and come off and once you put them back on, the lid won't close tight. Second, its not deep enough and every time i try to deep fry anything more than about 2 inches tall i have to watch it and turn it and i never get an even turn out. one side is always darker than the other. Even more, the basket is small and useless, the item is hard to clean as it doesn't come apart at all, it has a safety power plug so that if it falls the power plug disconnects and after a while it won't plug into the unit tightly. I say it is useless"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted under a year","review":"This deep fryer was pretty good until last night when it died. It didn't even make it a year.

We have had so much fun deep frying! Last night it was chicken nuggets for the kids and batter dipped veggies for us. Friends stopped by right after we finished cooking and agreed the food was delicious. Some words of advice, only use the basket with frozen foods, otherwise the batter sticks to the sides of it. With non frozen items, just drop the food in the hot oil.You may wish to pick up a wire scoop to dish food out. A good dipping sauce we found is a combination of mayonaise and honey. Overall, it's an easy fryer to use at a great price. It produces yummy food and is lots of fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you keep receipt & warranty","review":"I have owned 2 of these fryers....2 years in a row. Suffice to say their reliability over the long term is dubious at best.The problem that I've encountered after awhile of use is that though the indicator lights are on......the unit stops heating. Given that the heating coil is integrated into the Oil well itself may have something to do with it.However, it does do the job and the Basket and cover are convenient. it does have a relatively large basket and the oil well is constructed of pretty heavy metal and is easy to remove. Not the easiest thing to clean.Just make sure to keep your receipt & warranty booklet because you're gonna need it (they did replace the broken ones quickly however)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep fat Fryer","review":"We are pleased, both with the timely arrival of the product and the excellent product itself.

However, after using it a few times it seemed to me that the oil didn't heat up to the selected temperature. Using my trusty candy thermometer (which i knew to be very accurate) I checked the accuracy of the thermostat. I found that my unit maintained the oil at 15 degrees lower than as set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designed by a Lawyer","review":"This unit fries food OK although you can't overload it with too many frozen items or the oil temperature goes down quickly. In addition, I had to max out the temperature control to get the oil hot enough. But the real deal breaker for me is the extremely short wall cable with a magnetic connector that attaches to the device. The connector is meant to come loose when someone tugs on it. However, mine came loose every time we opened the top of the unit or everytime we loaded items in the basket. I'm sure their lawyers didn't want someone to sue them for damages if the thing turned over by pulling on the cord but, this is a little over kill. The cord is about two feet long and they state that you should not use an extension cord with it, so make sure you're near an outlet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story Leads to a Lovely Hobby","review":"Certainly, it doesn't take children very long to learn how to hunt for treasures while at the beach.

Cowboy Bebop has more style in it's worst episodes than anything on television at the moment. The animation is beautiful, the story is meaningful, the action intense, the humor always clever.

Buy it, for the love of all that is good in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The exciting conclusion to one of the best anime series","review":"This was the in my opinion the best of the Cowboy Bebop DVDs that I own.

I found the plot and story lame and from episode to episode didn't really stick to the story as a whole unlike some of the others I've watched. I really didn't like any of the characters in it and to top it off the ending was so darn depressing. Now mind you I don't mind tragic endings, and that alone wouldn't have put me off. The problem is I found Bebop to be rather boring through most of the episodes and really only found a few that I enjoyed (the one about the mushrooms was good). In general though I really couldn't recommend this series. I would suggest renting it frist before deciding to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Anime Series of All Time","review":"My god, I wish all animes were this good.

While the 23rd episode is a bit weak, probably to fill space, it all gets made up for with the final three episodes in this collection. Faye and Ed both have to confront their pasts, and their decisions will forever affect the crew of the Bebop. Then, in the 25th episode, Spike and Jet are dealing with the ramifications of the previous episode when they get attacked! It turns out, Spike's past is finally coming back to haunt him, and this will change his life forever, in the final two episodes. Things get crazy, and you won't believe what happens in the end. It's pretty depressing, but it also makes sense, but I won't spoil what. The final episode on this disc alone deserves this five-star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is She Doin\` This To Us ?!","review":"I give up. This girl is getting worse with every single song.

In it, Mills states as matter of factly that the Russians are out pacing the west in production and technology. His assessment was that the west, more specifically the United States was acting in a way to cause world war three when the USSR wanted nothing but peace. According to Mills the USSR was just reacting to the American aggression. He remarks that if one is to state this fact you are considered unpatriotic. He states that the military build up is because the military industrial complex was benefiting and that our leaders are lazy and ignorant so it keeps going. He questions the morals of the leaders, in the march to war he believes they think they have a good moral code but Mills begs to differ.

We have the whole series for our 15 month old son, who especially loves Baby Newton and Shakespeare. However, when we watched this video, I was really disappointed. It just wasn't as interesting and engaging as the other videos. My son usually will dance, clap, talk and point to the images on the TV and sing along with the children, but Baby Galileo didn't hold his attention at all. It didn't seem to have the imagination and creative oomph that the other videos in the series have. Something was definitely missing in this video and though I think Disney is ok, they seriously messed up the originality of Julie Aigner-Clark's vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of the earlier Baby Einstein videos. My son loves Baby Mozart, Baby Van Gogh and Baby Shakespeare and I am amazed and captivated as well! Particularly Van Gogh and Shakespeare capture my son's attention because of the puppetry. So, when I saw the title Baby Gallileo and the description I thought this would be perfect for my 15 month old son, as he loves the moon, the sky, the stars in all his books. Well, he cries when this video is put on! I have noticed a change from the earlier videos - the puppets aren't the same (and children like familiarity) and even if they are different, there's not enough of them! This is the second video we've purchased that we have been disappointed with since the company was sold (Baby Beethoven is boring to my son.) I don't want to give up on the company just yet, but I think I will have to preview them before buying them from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"It seems that now that Disney has a key role in it that everything in there videos becomes more of a marketing hype and less focus on education.

My husband and I thought this would be another hit and it wasn't. This is rather boring ... it doesn't have any of the \\"zing\\" that Baby Noah or Baby MacDonald has. Even Baby Beethoven and Baby Mozart are better and these are far less glitzy productions. True, the subject matter of Galileo is a little bit more abstract, but I really feel it could have been done much better.

We have all of the other ones and our children love them. HOWEVER, we were truly disappointed with this one. First of all, the music doesn't flow at all. Seems like they just took excerpts from the other videos and slapped it altogether. You can use music from different composers, but you need to match it to your objects and have it flow throughout the video. What I thought was the ending of this video, it wasn't. Secondly, although the first baby einstein videos were low budget, I thought they were great and the picture quality was much better than whatever Disney used, and they captured their audience: babies & toddlers. Disney screwed this one up, big time! My 10-month old lost interest very soon. This deserves no stars!

I've tried to get her to give the video a chance because she's always pointing at the sun or the moon in the sky, but it doesn't interest her at all. The video seems extremely unimaginative, especially in comparison to the others we've seen. I watched the credits and it doesn't appear as if found Julie Aigner-Clark was involved in the making of this video and it certainly shows. Tossing in a few spinning stars and a puppet doesn't make this a video worthy of the Baby Einstein name. Might I suggest Neighborhood Animals or Baby Van Gogh instead?"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY KIDS LOVE IT!","review":"Baby Einstein has been a permanent fixture at our house.

It is unfortunate that Disney decided to change formats and puppets. Some of the footage of clouds and space are visually stimulating, but the video doesn't flow and lacks the personality that the other Einstein videos have in spades. I hope for the next production, they will go back to the old format, but if they do not, we will stop buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't spend the money","review":"There's never been a Baby Einstein video I didn't love...until this one. The puppets are awful and the show moves so slowly my baby wouldn't watch it for one minute. I can't understand what happened to a company that used to make the ONLY videos that my baby would watch. Buy the others, but don't buy this one. You'll be wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language not age appropriate","review":"Not only is this the only BE dvd that can't holdmy daughter's attention but it 'wastes' vocabulary teaching time by teaching the names of all of the planets - which I don't think will be useful for most children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and too many toys -- UGH!","review":"I don't know why I keep buying Baby Einstein tapes for my kids, but I keep thinking that maybe Disney will up the quality or educational content or something. Wrong! This tape is full of the same basement production quality, annoying music box music and too many toys. I consider myself a fairly bright individual and I can't fathom how watching toys onscreen is beneficial for young children. We watched this once, and we won't watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"the unfortunate future of Baby Einstein","review":"I was very worried when Disney bought out Baby Einstein. This DVD has a completely different feel than then the others and is the first one my son didn't really respond to. It's funny, the number of people and production companies listed in the credits is many times greater than on the 'real' Baby Einstein's but the quality is much worse. Too bad Pixar didn't buy them! A sad turn of events."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fast For Comfort","review":"We have loved all the Baby Einstein products until now. This video strays away from the previous successful formula. The images change too fast. It couldn't hold my 3 year olds attention. I was shocked and sat down to watch it with him and quickly realized the images were changing at a much faster rate than the other previous releases. Before it would pause for much longer periods to let the child see and absorb what is being shown. With Galileo, you don't get as much chance to see before it goes on to the next scene. I was very disapointed and blame Disney. I hope they consider re-releasing it someday with the format adjusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"a look at planets for younger viewers","review":"this is one of the best ideas that einstein videos presents. a look at the planets. this video may seem older, but the shapes and colors of the planets, and the footage they give will entice younger viewers to watch. the video goes through all the planets by name, and shows them to you from telescopic footage, and then also uses toys, puppets, babies and other children to tie it all into a nicely presented work that toddlers will enjoy. i would guess that ages 2-5 would enjoy this most."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better!!","review":"My son has a ton of the baby einstein videos and this is the first one that did not keep his attention, i have tried over and over and Nicholas wants nothing to do with this video, i guess that's what happens when a huge company like disney gets involved...Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Amused","review":"Our 7 month old son loves the Baby Einstein videos but this one didn't keep his attention.

It looks like to much Disney and not enough Einstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"We have several of the Baby Einstein DVD's and this is the only one my 14 mos. won't sit still for. About 10 minutes into it, she gets up to go play. When watching the others she is mezmerized. Definitely the least entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointed","review":"It seems that now that Disney has a key role in it that everything in there videos becomes more of a marketing hype and less focus on education. I too have all the classics beginning with Baby Shakespeare (with the wonderful Blah sound from Bard the dragon whom my 3 year old absolutely loves)to Mozart, Van Gogh..... and was very disappointed when Disney took over because now I'm noticing even my son doesn't want to look at the newest and latest videos---he always goes back to the classics. Just goes to show that children can always tell the difference between good and bad. I'm highly disappointed that Disney messed up a really good educational product. But than that's disney for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work on all dvd players","review":"I think the one we got is a bootleg verison bc it wont play on my dvd player that all the other ones DO play on and it looks different too.

It's so incredibly boring and uninspiring. I thought I would try it again on my 12 month old today (he's addicted to the other (...) videos). Well, he turned his back on it (literally) and began paging through a book instead. It's poorly done, it's not nearly as good as the other ones (...).

Boy, was it a huge disappointment. My son (12 months) actually started crying and was frightened in some of the fast-moving, flying saucering scenes. The flow was terrible and the puppets weren't even that entertaining. He absolutely loves the Baby Einstein series, but this latest attempt was a flop! It seemed entirely too contrived and forced and didn't feel the same as the previous ones. If this is what we are to expect for future additions, we won't be buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great DVD. It is one of my daughter's favorites.

Disapointing!","review":"I live in a french speaking country, and I bought this DVD because usually Baby Einstein DVDs have langagues options. In Baby Galileo, on the pocket, it's written \\"Language tracsks (Spanish,French and English)\\" But when you play the DVD, on the menu, you don't even have the section \\"languages\\" in order to chose the language you want... I was disapointed... But the DVD doesn't seem that bad... There's a lot of things to learn about the sky... It's sad that my son cannot understand it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps his attention from start to finish","review":"Our baby grandson (10 months old) has most of the Baby Einstein titles and this one keeps his attention throughtout the entire presentation (as do Baby van Gogh, Mozart and Beethoven). The mother kangaroo and her baby (Baby Galileo) elicit giggles from him when they appear. The wonders of the universe are presented in a form that captures a child's attention. The classical music performed by the Baby Einstein players (juvenile synthesized sound) is fantastic and captivating, what a wonderful introduction to beautiful musicVery well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kangaroo has got to go!","review":"Really, the kangaroo puppets are a bit freaky looking and the lighted flying saucer looks like something out of the '70s! i kept looking over and over to be sure this was a new release---and scarily so, the graphics are pathetic for something done in 2003! (What happened to the awesome stuff used in Baby Neptune with FRIENDLY looking puppets and sweet children?!?!?) Is it more than a little strange how different in style and scale the BE dvds are? Also, a good bit of the music is just a repeat from prior baby einstein productions. a really lousy, low-budget looking film on the whole. I end this by saying what big fans we (vis a vis our toddler) are of baby einstein productions-particularly baby mozart, neptune and now baby beethoven. We will not give up on BE but will continue to view the new releases from netflix before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for baby","review":"I own all of the Baby Einstein DVDs and my daughter loves each one of them. She watches them three times a day (during mealtimes) and they keep her interest even after the many, many times she has seen them (she is twelve months old and has been watching them since she was three months old). Baby Galileo is very slow paced and my daughter will sit through it, but she does not enjoy it like she does the others. You should try other Baby Einstein DVDs first, especially Baby Mozart. But if you really want to buy a DVD your baby will love, get some Bear in the Big Blue House DVDs. How educational!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"Like most Baby Einstein enthusiasts, I ran out and bought the newest thinking it would be as spectacular as the rest. WRONG!My daughter barely made it through the opening. She didn't want to have anything to do with it. She walked away! The whole feel and look of the video was different. It almost didn't even seem like a Baby Einstein video! One of the things that drew me to the collection in the first place was the \\"real world\\" feeling that the videos offered. But this one was all fluff. It seriously missed the mark.This was"},{"rating":"2","title":"OUR FAVORITE JUST FEELS TOO SHORT!! BUY IT ON DVD not VHS","review":"SO I bought this one while on vacation with my little boy of then 10 months. Totally mesmerized by this one and I loved it too, the music and content.I've just bought baby neptune & van gogh and I liked it alot but my son goes in and out of one, more verbal and maybe he's a little young for it, but looks great. The only one that annoys me is the baby einstein language nursery, annoyed me to have it on, the sounds of all the different languages, not musical. Didn't care for their choice of language and the visuals were too boring, too slow, & too simple...looks like they spent little on making this video.ANyway ...baby mozart was great for the younger months. world animals ok.well thats what i think, hope it helps ya in some way"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son's second favorite","review":"Next to Baby Neptune, this is our 16-month-old son's favorite Baby Einstein video. He has already learned to say \\"moon\\" and \\"sky\\" from watching it. Love the music, especially the \\"moon\\" section, so much that I just bought the Baby Galileo CD for the car. Some of the footage they picked to go along with the \\"planets\\" sequence could be considered a stretch... what do bubbles have to do with Pluto? My kid thinks the part where the mouse eats the moon-made-of-cheese is hilarious. The scene for one of the planets where the little ball rolls down the long back-and-forth ramp and out the hole at the bottom, while the boy giggles and points, seems to have been put in there as a joke for the parents--we suspect the Baby Einstein people are trying to say that food goes through your intestines and then out Uranus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video","review":"My 5 month-old enjoys watching this DVD - I was worried it would be too fast or advanced. She really likes it. I think this is one of their better videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boys love it","review":"I have 9 month twin boys and Baby Galileo is their 2nd video in the series. It really keeps their attention and has a wonderful variety of scenery. I'm very disappointed in ones who have written in and said they did not like it. We must remember all children have different taste. Also, this video was not made to entertain or educate adults! We should be happy that videos like BE has been made for our children because there is so much garbage out there that many allow their little ones to watch. I would recommend this video to any parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointing","review":"We have the entire Einstein collection and were very excited to see the new one. First of all, one of my child's favorite part is the little caterpillar that comes out at the beginning of the video-missing from the new Galileo! They used different puppets rather than hand held and it just wasn't the same quality. Whereas my baby sits virtually hypnotized by the other videos, he is not impressed with this one at all, he's bored after about 15 minutes. I was planning on picking up Newton but I think I'm going to wait and see what other parents comment first."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can tell Disney did this one","review":"We have ALL of the Baby Einstein videos. I love the line, but this one isn't up to par with the others. Baby Galileo doesn't hold her attention like the others. It's too computerized and not enough sketches with children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree! Very disappointing.","review":"Our 1-year-old son has 6 of the Baby Einstein DVDs. He usually loves watching them, but for this one, he (and we) do not enjoy it at all. It feels like virtually every item they show on the screen is spinning. He gets very restless and we understand why. If you want a DVD to make you feel dizzy, buy this one. If you would prefer to better spend your money, buy Baby Mozart or Baby Neptune."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"I was disappointed with this Disney-ised edition of Julie Clark's videos. The puppets looked flat and didn't relate with my baby at all. The entire video looked too orchestrated and doesn't have the personal feel of the old 'from my household to yours...' My baby didn't seem to mind; she just turned away to do more interesting things. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Where's Julie Clark??","review":"Compared to other baby videos on the market -- so smart, baby genius, baby babble, etc. (we've got a lot of them!) -- this is a video of obviously superior production quality. However, if you read the credits, Julie Clark had nothing to do with making this one. There are certain, subtle things that Disney does and does not do that make this lack the charm of the older BE videos. For example, transitions from image to image are not phrased to the music and are random. And in the video shots of mobiles, the camera is also rotating, which ruins the simplicity and pleasant effect of watching the mobile. That being said, we still really like the video. It has great shots of stars and planets, and is relaxing to watch in the evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Encription!! Try VHS?!","review":"We have several of the Baby Enistien titles on both DVD and VHS. Our three children love them. We recieved a copy of Baby Galileo on DVD for christmas. The movie is cute but the video encription must be off. The motion of the toys and puppets is jerky and kind of nausating to watch. None of our other titles have this problem. This was a 2003 release maybe someone at disney will get hip and fix it. Cute video, dont like to watch it a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"I was (and I think I can say the same for my 17 month old daughter) VERY disappointed in this DVD. I was excited about playing this for her because she absolutely loves all the other Baby Einstein videos (even Baby Neptune, which is the first Disney made video). My daughter lost interest in this after the first two minutes. I kept watching it, hoping it would get better so I could draw her attention to it, but it was just painful. If your child somewhat loses interest in the other BE videos during the \\"downtime\\" (ie, slow music), do NOT purchase this video. The entire DVD is full of the slow, downtime music. I wish I could return it and get my money back. I will second-guess buying any more Disney made BE videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick with the earlier baby einstein videos","review":"My daughter absolutely loves the Baby Einstein video series, but not Baby Galileo. Hand puppets have been replaced by choppy computer animated puppets which are not visually appealing at all. Musical selections are a bore as well since they're repeats from older videos..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Their Best","review":"As the mother of a wonderful 10 month old baby girl, I can say that we both love the Baby Einstein line of books and videos. Baby Galileo looked promising. After several viewings, however, my daughter resorted to pulling all of the magazines off of the coffee table for the millionth time which proved to be much more stimulating. Try Language Nursery of World of Animals. They truly capture her imagination as do the books Neighborhood Animals, Cats, and Babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful with a capital \\"A\\"","review":"What happened to the beauty of the original Baby Einstein series?? What happened to Julie Clark?? This video is boring, slow paced and completely unimpressive. My baby wouldn't watch it for more than a minute. Buy the original Einstein videos, but stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the rest","review":"My daughter only pays attention for the first half of the video. With all the other Baby Einstien videos she watches the entire thing - over and over (if I let her.) I'm not sure what is different, but the same appeal isn't there. Although, I got a refresher course in the order of the planets :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it...My son and Husband did not","review":"I actually didn't get a chance to sit down and watch this through because my husband insisted on returning it (I rent all B.E. videos before buying) right away because he thought it was dumb and claimed my son didn't like it either. I noticed that it hadn't really kept my child's attention as well as some of the other B.E. videos but the parts that he did pay particular attention were the hubble telescope images. I personally *love* images of space so I'll probably buy this video anyways for later when my son is older (he's only 7 mos now) but not just becuase of the great imagery but because it introduces words like, galaxy, constellation, names of planets, etc... and I believe he'll appreciate that more when he's a bit older."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's TERRIBLE and very cheaply made","review":"This does not engage my 9-month-old at all, who loves the Baby Einstein \\"Old MacDonald\\" and \\"Neighborhood Animals\\" and used to love all Bach, Beethovens, and Mozarts. These dvds are the only thing that will actually keep her still when eating or when it's time to calm down before nap and bed. I was excited to introduce her to a new concept and this movie is just horrible. It is very cheaply made and it keeps showing the same garden twirling star toy over and over again. You would really think they would find more creative toys to put into the video.So why 2 stars and not 1? I do like that the planets are named and footage of the real planets are shown as well as the stars. But other than that, it is just terrible and not a learning experience nor a tool for me to begin her quiet time."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring for one year old","review":"My one year old son loves all of the baby einstein dvd's except for Baby Mozart(which was his all time favorite in infancy)and Baby Einstein which are too slow for him now.I was excited when Baby Galileo came out but we both were bored by it. There are not enough puppets, they keep repeating the same toys (maybe because they couldn't find enough in the categories)and perhaps for his age, he's just not interested inlooking at real white speckled stars in the nite sky. Maybe when he's a bit older, we'll try it again.Although, he did get to see images of the sun, stars, moon, clouds, planets and galaxies. The space segment was the best with robots and rocket ships. I noticed in the credits that there are so many people involved now yet Baby Galileo seemed very thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're getting worse!","review":"We own all of the Baby Einstein DVD's and the one's made before the Disney buy out were far better than those made after. This one was the worst so far, my 18 mo. old doesn't even like it. They do talk about the planets and name them. But what do bubbles have to do with planets? The music was good (even though their were a few Disney songs thrown in) but overall the movie was dull and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for my 14-month old","review":"We have the Baby Einstein - World Animals DVD and my 14-month old absolutely LOVES that one. I ran out and bought this one thinking it would have more \\"action\\" and puppet skits. Instead, it just shows pictures of the sky.

It is really good: Kind of jam-jazz without a lot of vocals. The songs progress and go somewhere. bass, guitar, sax, organ, drums and wonderful groove weirdness...This cd and the following one (In Search Of...) are both very good. As good IMO as much more well known bands that could possibly be considered musical cousins of TTC such as Soulive or New Mastersounds or others carrying on the torch of funkysoulgroove in their own way. On a side note: for fans of the Prog Rock band Yes, TTC's sax player has a CD of Yes covers with baritone, alto, tenor and soprano sax arrangements that is done really well and does the songs justice while presenting them in a new way.

Hopefully it'll be reincarnated into something useful - perhaps a solid and reliable cardboard box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Partisan cheerleading: inconsistent with the series","review":"Working my way through the Character Above All series has been a pleasant and often enlightening experience. However that was not the case with the lecture on Ronald Reagan. Peggy Noonan, who worked with the president, made no attempt to sound objective. For most of her talk Ms. Noonan alternates between defensiveness and partisan pining for her glory days gone by. The rest of the series is quite excellent and features some of today's towering figures of presidential biography. Doris Kearns Goodwin talks about FDR. David McCollough tells stories from his award winning book on Truman. Robert Dalleck rescues LBJ from being totally obscured by Vietnam. Even George Bush gets a fair hearing from Michael Beschloss. But Ronald Reagan gets a cheerleader. Ms. Noonan's partisanship seems grossly out of place among these historians. Reagan deserved better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect He's Not","review":"this is an interesting read, but if i had my \\"druthers\\", i would have preferred it if DW had left out the early chapters describing his youth, minor league experiences, etc. its important to remember that this is not social commentary, its a behind the scenes book about baseball - written by, arguably, the most colorful individual on the diamond today. if you like books that explore the \\"wild side\\" of sports life, you won't be disappointed here. if your after one that chronicles the day to day grind of an average ballplayer, replete with all the detail - this one isn't for you. also, this isn't a \\"yankee\\" book, so if you're a \\"pinstripe\\" hater you'll enjoy it too. don't expect much more than the meandering recollections of one of baseball's throwback heroes. you'll also learn that, despite the publicity that depicts wells as a party animal supremo, he is also a disciplined competitor who has endured his share of pain and hard work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wished There was More!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book, it had many funny and enjoyable stories about his life both off the field and in the major leagues. I really don't know what all the controversy was about regarding this book, it didn't really appear to me that he was degrading the yankees, in the book he holds the organization with high regard as well as the fans.

At best David Wells is an above average pitcher with some moments of brilliance with what was otherwise mediocre pitching ability.He's not Gibson, Carlton, Seaver or even Jerry Koosman. These are pitchers who won on the basis of their abilities to throw full, consistent games. Wells had the good fortune to be in lineups that could stake him 3-4-5 runs a game. How can you not win with O'Neil or Jeter on your team?Maybe he expected we'd be enthralled by his behavior or exposes of player behavior. The original, Ball Four does it better. His antics pale next to the original, Mantle, Maris and Martin.Save yourself the money, borrow it at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going to the Wells once too often","review":"This book represents all that is wrong with the New York Yankees and all that is wrong with baseball. Pure egotistical drivel by an ignorant man. Literary gruel that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. As a palate cleanser, read THE LITTLE RED SOX BOOK by Bill \\"Spaceman\\" Lee, the antithesis of Yankeeism, and a man who reflects and embodies the pure joy of baseball. A ton of laughs( like having Babe Ruth stay in Boston and Ted Williams killing Hitler with a line drive!!) for those who can read and chew gum at the same time.Fred in Boston"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat cowardice","review":"A bunch of boring baloney.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's a mess","review":"Here is just another way of generating more money for another Yankee. He is a disgrace to baseball and too overweight to play it.

In no way did Boomer tarnish the Yankees image. I think it was tarnished long before he even got there. Anyway, this is a great book. Plenty of good stories to get you chuckling. David's first adventure at hunting with Kirk Gibson is a riot. It still makes me chuckle. It's nice to see the \\"other side\\" of David and life on the road. Wish more baseball books were like this. Definitely no fluff in here. David shoots right from the hip."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good book","review":"This book really gives you a good idea about the life of David \\"Boomer\\" Wells.

Yes, I am a Yankee fan, especially, a David Wells fan. He has a way to hold your interest in every chapter. I also can see how some \\"drama queens \\" can take some of Wells information and \\"run\\" with it. I found the book to be another great example of how and what it takes to become a great major league baseball player, actually, it is how anybody can get where they want to go, with the right support and a strong need to get there.

That's not to say that it isn't entertaining - on the contrary, it's very amusing - but the antics of Meg Langslow's suspect pool reached new heights. As part of the buyer's agreement for their new house, Michael and Meg organize a large yard sale to unburden themselves of the previous owner's goods, while generating a small profit for the deceased's family. On the day the 30-family yard sale opens up a local scalawag/antiques dealer is murdered in Meg's barn, and everything goes downhill from there. As a police investigation goes underway on one side, a carnival springs up on Meg and Michael's front lawn, with suspects darting to and fro. In the end it all adds to the charm and chuckles, and the Meg Langslow books continue to be an endearing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read them all -- this is the best one yet","review":"I've read all of the Meg Lanslow Mysteries and after reading We'll Always Have Parrots, I was excitedly looking forward to reading Owls Well That Ends Well.

Nothing original, nothing new, and nothing to write home about. I was so dissapointed because when Donna Andrews burst onto the scene her writing was fresh, funny and fabulous.

At the end of the 5-year period turning wrench, I bought the rebuild kit (another nice feature, available in the 90's for about {$$$}), which restored all of its original power.Also, check out the I.R. impact sockets.

I've used it for removing things like lawnmower blade bolts, frozen nuts from plumbing fixtures, lug nuts, etc. with no problems at all. I was a little disappointed, however, to see that the wrench was made in China. I figured with a brand like Ingersoll-Rand it'd be a pretty safe bet that I'd be getting a US-made tool, but that was not the case.

An unfortunate mistake on the behalf of the authorities, since the arrest only gave Kent more fuel for his hatred. The arrest made this book possible, so the police really only succeeded in spreading Matt Kent's words to an even wider audience.I'm not going to say this book is well-written--Matt Kent is very much obsessed with himself and his own self-satisfied righteous anger--but it provides an important perspective on how spoiled, frustrated youth are dealing with their affluence and priviledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a Raving Lunatic","review":"This book is written by a raving lunatic, it is no surprised that this Matt Kent obsesses over \\"abandoned asylums\\" in his websites.

They not only wrote amazing lyrics; such as the song ELITE-\\"When you're ripe, you'll bleed out of control\\", but Chino used the full extent of his voice, which is just simply angelic in the song TEENAGER. They seemed to be more open then on either of the other cd's which might upset some fans, since they are used to the screaming and more hardcore sound they have once emmitted, but I believe that if one is tuely a deftones fan, he or she will appreciate the new cd for its content and experimental, more poetic music style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beauty of Anguish","review":"Not since \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" has an artist so aptly articulated such complete, fulfilling emotional fury.

Of course, there are lots of holes in the story line, but then time travel lends itself to that. Jake is the romantic lead but looks sick and hungover. But his eyes are still amazing so the love connection was not too hard to believe.Nice surprise of a movie we knew nothing about."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I was very pleased with the condition of the product and the time I received ur as well.. thank u for the sell..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eight minutes to find a terrorist.","review":"The trick is you can repeat those eight minutes until you find him.Take this simple premise; add in a super secret government experiment, personal lives and some compassion. Mix well and make into an entertaining movie. Saying more would convert this from a review into a spoiler. The film never drags nor is it repetitious. Each segment is the same but with a different twist as the list of suspects narrows down to the terrorist. The ending is a real surprise and great fun. This is not Shakespeare, Williams or another great playwright. The dialog supports the story and the acting supports the dialog. Both are entertaining and keep our attention.I found this to be an enjoyable way to spend an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Sleeper","review":"First happened to see this movie on a ferry in rough seas.

I wouldn't say it's non stop suspense good or anything but the theme is pretty original and I did enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I think a viewer needs to be a certain type. Source code is a science fiction story. The viewer needs to be able to suspend what they know and allow themselves to go along for the ride. One thing about the story that I kept thinking was how I would do this differently, but then I realized that the character had emotional issues of his own to deal with. The progression of events demonstrates a rather typical bias against the military and the belief that they will always consider things in terms of \\"acceptable losses.\\" Still, in this movie the big, bad military supervisors are dealt with rather elegantly by an underling that won't follow orders. The result is somewhat shocking on the one hand, and somewhat predictable on the other. Overall I enjoyed the story, even with the bias, the predictable issues all the way through, and the questionable science. This is science fiction - all of these things. You accept it for what it is or you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"This movie is full of action and science fiction. I enjoyed it and would watch it again.

The supporting cast were great, the interactions realistic, and the suspense believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking ending.","review":"For some reason, I have always been fascinated by time travel stories. What is unique about this story is that it is not so much a time travel story as it is a story about alternate realities.

This film is a take on the TV show Quantum Leap, but instead of leaping until the issue is solved, the leaper only has 8 minutes to try and solve the problem. Jake Gyllenhaal stars and while I usually don't care for him much, he was excellent here. I have a feeling this character may have been written specifically for him, because he's got a strange style and seems to not fit many of his roles. Source Code is another film in a genre of endless possibilities, it tries really hard to stand out and be special, but sadly it's pretty predictable, while playing off other established material, such as Quantum Leap and The Matrix. It is an enjoyable film and one of Gyllenhaal's best performances that i've seen, but if you're into Science Fiction, the way that I am, you're not gonna have much trouble figuring this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"Jake Gyllenhaal continues to create unimpressive movies. If you can't figure out who the terrorist is in the first scene, you aren't very good at noticing the obvious. If you think the movie won't end exactly how it does, then you are not good at noticing the obvious. Yes, there is a minor twist in the plot - one that makes the premise even more absurd - but maybe some will find that cool. I did not.This is not a good movie. It requires zero critical thinking and even less intelligence. It's almost like a comedy writer tried to write an suspenseful action film, but forgot that you need a solid storyline and plot to create suspense - and a halfway decent special effects budget to blow up trains.Don't do it. Not worth the time, not worth the money, and not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"source code","review":"It is sad to see that the original movie filmed at 1.85:1 was cut too 1.78:1 with no disclaimer that the film had been altered.

So you invent one of the most amazing technical marvels in history and then name it SOURCE CODE!!!!!?!?!?! That's like building the pyramids and calling them rock piles.

I was interested for the first half or so. Then you realize the doofus who named the movie \\"source code\\" probably came up with the rest of the movie. Honestly it felt like someone who only writes cheesy romantic comedies for a living was given a treatment and forced to make a scifi movie.

We must learn. Now we're all SUSPECTS.And we're made to accept this because it's in a MOVIE and not real.

There's a small extension on the lid that hooks into the machine and locks it so you can't accidentally open it while it's running. Not once but TWICE that piece broke off.

I bought this model because I wanted a cheap, small processor for quick jobs. My main complaints are that: 1)It leaks if you are processing wet ingredients (like salsa); 2) It doesn't have enough power to handle more difficult jobs like Parmesan cheese; 3) It will still work even if the lid is not completely on (safety issue). It is OK for jobs like chopping nuts, but don't expect it to chop anything FINELY (humus will NEVER be smooth). If you really find the price too irresistable to resist, you will get the maximum use out of it if you pulse instead of holding the button down to continously process; otherwise, expect a strong burning odor and the blade may pop out of place. Splurge for a more top of the line model that will last for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopster lids need better design","review":"The Toastmaster chopster 1122 is a fine little machine, but the plastic lid is too flimsy and breaks easily making the machine inoperable.

It does but you have to unscrew the holder it's in, flip it back and tighten it and it doesn't seem strong enough to hold it. Then when you do fold it down, it doesn't come down completely straight so any can with liquid or juice will likely come spilling out because the can is slanted (unless you hold it straight while the can is opening). Now the blade is starting to not even go into the cans and you have to force it and we've only had it for just over 3 months. For lack of a better description...piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"This is the worst can opener ever. The magnet is not strong enough to hold heavier cans, i.e. refried beans (normal size can), so it drops them and they spill all over your counter.

Unfortunately, I didn't check my faucet before I ordered. This does not have a overflow feature and requires a drain assembly from Decolay for bathroom use. (Bathroom sinks are normally a thicker material than stainless steel.) It is a beautiful sink and would have looked great had I ordered the proper drain assembly and faucet for it. It is only 12 inches deep and 17 inches wide which made it perfect for a tight space without looking cramped-my vanity is 19\\"x 26\\". I really hated to send it back, but the faucet assembly I had matched the tub and shower assemblies so I didn't have much choice. Even those who thought I was out of my mind for considering putting a steel sink in the bathroom thought it was stunning when they saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use can opener","review":"While I am not as thrilled as some people who reviewed this product, I do have to say that once I got the hang of it, it is easy to use. It is sharp and cuts the can lid so that there are no jagged edges nor are there places where the can lid is not cut (this was happening with my other one). Although the magnet is supposed to hold the lid and pull it off of the can for easier disposal, I find that it is not strong enough to held the can lids. However, with the clean cutting of the can lid, I really do not thing this poses a problem. It is easy to turn the handle to cut the can. It is light weight but is substantial enough to feel that you have a tool that will do the job it was designed for. Overall, I am happy with it. I have had both manual can openers and also electric ones, and I always go back to the manual ones. They work, they are easy to clean, and they fit in the utility drawer. I think it is well worth the money and hope to be using it for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, mess free, and safe","review":"I've seen a lot of complaints concerning fine metal \\"powder\\" along the rim of cans; however, I have not seen this after some use. What I have seen is an easy to use tool that removes lids without leaving a sharp edge for your finger to become cut on that works every time. Even cans with dents at the lid have been able to work with this opener. For fun, I even removed the new easy pull-type lids, found on many cans of Campbell's soup. This thing is effective and useful and should replace everyone's archaic can opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid item","review":"Good quality. I like the magnet.

However, this one really has gone the distance. I have owned it for nearly 3 years and without regrets. I'm buying one for my grandmother who fell in love with it during her visit and maybe in another year I'll replace this one.The only improvement I'd make is that it should be easier to clean. It's comparable to other can openers in that way.

However, very soon after I acqauired the product, two errors occurred: (i) the magnetic lid device began to malfunction, since the cutter did not sever the lids all the way around; (ii) and more importantly the product fell apart after two months, because the small pin at the top of the product holding the two halves of the product together fell out or otherwise failed. I was able to reassemble the two halves by reinserting the pin and fumbling around and finally reseating the two halves.

What kid doesn't think that? Age of the parent has little to do with it. One legitimate concern raised by interviewees was that an older parent may need care or pass on sooner in the child's life -that was one of the few things in the book worth thinking about in my opinion.

The door would just open and close on its own, frequently stopping half way or with just a third of it opened or closed before pausing and then starting again.Being generally skeptical about the paranormal I leant toward the remote as the possible cause. Opened it up again and noticed there seemed to be some burn marks as though it had shorted. Don't know much about garages and remotes but this seemed bad.After searching for replacement models with 12 dip switches found this one. Was easy to set (replicating dip switch configuration) and works beautifully. Both remotes are a bit large compared to what I had at the last house but then again that one sometimes didn't work at all. So maybe size does matter.

It REALLY made me think again about what I thought that a good name would be for my child. My husband and I changed our minds a few times because of what we read in this book. However, I have to say that it is already outdated. There are some popular names that we thought of that aren't listed. Also, it references names of famous people, and there are many well-known people that aren't mentioned. I recommend buying a used copy and reading another more current baby name book in addition.

The \\"cute,\\" \\"popular\\" or \\"trendy\\" names are the most favored. A name like Ariana is viewed as positive and beautiful, while something like Fern (which I think is cool) is seen as old-fashioned and ugly. There's also not enough names listed. If you're about to have a baby and you're looking for a name, this book isn't the way to go. It's very limited in the options, because for the most part it uses well-known and well-used names, or it goes the other extreme and uses names that you probably wouldn't ever consider. For example, I think names like Adolph and Henrietta are in here. There's no middle ground.

It had a great life and can be replaced for 19.99 (at least as of today). No brainer. If you need a glue gun you can't go wrong. Hopefully my next will last as long as my first.

I followed the instructions on the bottle suggesting that Prelief be taken 3 times a day every day as opposed to only when acidic food is eaten. I took 2 tablets 3 times a day and within 24 hours I had a full-blown IC flareup on my hands which took a couple weeks to get under control, which included a doctor's visit, lab tests, and prescriptions. I haven't taken Prelief since, and am open to possibly taking it when I eat acidic foods, but nothing would induce me to take it regularly again. My doctor thought that perhaps it had made my bladder too alkaline too fast and upsetting its delicate balance is what caused a flareup.

A forced triple-twist ending, which employs two of the most overused cliches of the genre and undermines the story's internal logic, does nothing to redeem the end product.It's also a little sad that it took five screenwriters to create such a painfully unoriginal story.

I brew coffee many times in a day, I am also somewhat picky about my coffee. I buy Intelligencia Coffee (here in Chgo.)and find that this grinder causes the grounds to stick to the bottom of the grinder and clump more.Does not hold enough beans(only 2 oz) for more than 6 cups, takes a longer time to grind than a couple of the other big brands. Also, the blades are not has heavy duty as others.I see it selling here for $10-THAT I would pay for this grinder, otherwise I'd move on to one of the Krups fast touch(for a few bucks more)- another blade type of grinder.Not the grinder for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great toastmaster grinder","review":"i just recently purchase salba seeds and i needed to grind, this toastmaster little grinder does a great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldest appliance in my kitchen","review":"My mom got this for me when I was in college about 3 years ago.

Also the lid didn't seem to want to sit on it properly. Wasn't snug at all, like my other coffee-type grinders. The oat powder got all over the outside of the grinder, I'm guessing because the lid wouldn't fit snuggly.

It works great. But it does make a mess when you take the lid off, the coffee grounds stick to the inside of the lid.

Way less mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but not satisfying!","review":"It is just Ok! Yes the price is cheap, but I would have opt for another brand with the difference of a few bucks. It doesn't have any setting for different levels of grinding (Like for espresso or other types. Other grinders with similar prices have this option).

I would recommend buying this product if you are looking for an inexpensive but reliable coffee or spice grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use your blender instead!","review":"I bought this item to grind fresh coffee everyday. It makes such a mess that I only ground my coffee once a week. Eventually I went back to grinding the whole bag of coffee at the store. Once when I purchased two pounds of whole beans I decided to try the blender to do the job. It worked better than the coffee grinder! Less mess and less noise. I just used the high power grind setting. My blender is an old Hamilton Beach model with a glass pitcher. Save your money, just use your blender!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works good but a few issues","review":"This grinder is really good for the money. My two complaints are that it is difficult to clean since you cannot take the blade or the part that holds the coffee grinds out of the device, and that it does not grind extremely fine. The fineness of the coffee grinds does not seem to impact the flavor, however. I would recommend this product to anyone who grinds coffee occasionally.

I've most likely received a defective product which can happen with anything. But the grinder I received never worked quite right to begin with. First, the switch didn't work but only part of the time, and then there was the day I plugged it in and had a fireball go off in my hand. \\"No damage, but a stinging sensation.\\" I realized that there were sparks going off everywhere including on the inside of the unit where the coffee was being ground, and so, I don't consider this item any too safe and will be replacing it with a different unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sucks.","review":"Here's why:- It's a huge pain to clean: none of the parts are removable, and it has tons of little crevices where stuff gets stuck, so you're reduced to rubbing it down with a wet paper towel (you can't submerge any part of it either). Additionally, the bowl inside isn't fixed so it spins when you try to wipe it, and unless you have super tiny fingers there's no way you can get the underside of the blades clean- you will have to get used to that paprika taste in your coffee if you intend to grind spices too- The contruction is terrible: I've had it a month and the button that turns it on is already going.Conclusion: Spend the extra $3 get something that isn't a piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good","review":"This grinder attracted me because of its cheap price.

Well, the replacement does exactly the same thing as the original. I think the placement of the thermostat (up front and below the case) is the problem.I gave both of them to the Good Will.

The fact that it has anything to do with her being attacked by a poltergiest does not make it any more necessary.The story jumps around far too much. The characters do nothing to add to a story which is dead after a very exciting first chapter.

The size of the camera has nothing to do with these statements. It would be a choice of film. Not camera size. What if the photographer used B/W film in a 2 1/4 camera would you still get more color saturation?Now days wedding photography is done with $8,000.00 35mm digital cameras.This book is out to do one thing put money in the author's pocket no matter how accurate the information is.

They have no regard for etiquette and are openly hostile towards people who do. They make several incredibly offensive references towards \\"anorexic\\" girls, and there is some strange misinformation. For example they say that Priscilla of Boston has gone out of business and that the label is now sold by David's, which just isn't true. In addition, the writing is terrible and the overall tone is very much \\"they're out to get you\\", which is just silly.If you are having a big, traditional wedding in a small town (and over a size 10, apparently), you might get something out of this book.

A lot of the advice about how to avoid scams and save money was fine, if you didn't know it from other consumer dealings (eg, pay with your credit card in case a place goes out of business), but too often bargain-hunting took the place of good taste. If you can't afford an open bar, don't serve liquor. But charging your guests for drinks? Would you do that at home? Your reception isn't your magic day where everything must be over the top. Your reception is really just another party, albeit probably bigger and nicer than what you usually do.

If you are on a budget and just starting your look at how you want to celebrate the start of your marriage, I recommend _One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding_ (a little academic, but eye-opening) or _Brides, Inc_. Does your wedding have to be $30,000 extravaganza? No. Does it have to be a bargain-basement version with an over-priced at any price white meringue dress, tasteless multi-tiered cake and tons of tulle ?No. Just remember: it's a ceremony followed by a party with people you love and who love you. If you want the frills but lack the cash, then maybe this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"So far it has been very worthwhile. Most books give general ideas (get married outside, buy a sample dress, etc.) This one gives you specific stores, sites, designers, etc. and their ratings. So, it's actually helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Most of the material is basic knowledge I already knew. Such as, you can save money by buying your dress online or asking a friend to make one. The only part I liked was the questions to ask vendors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE if you are on a budget!","review":"I can't imagine planning our wedding without it. Even if you don't have a strict budget, this is a great book to have for reference. I've purchased 4 different books for planning our wedding and this is the one I read the most (the cover is completely misshapen). Its inspired me to do my own flowers to save money, and the information about the different bridal gown designers was more helpful than I would have imagined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Info!!","review":"I ordered 4 Bridal books, and this one was my favorite. It has great info on saving money, reviews, and wedding websites. It has a guarantee to refund your money for the book if it doesn't save you $500 on your wedding! How can you pass up a book like that!? I really enjoyed the tone of the book - down to earth, conversational, friendly - yet not flippant and superficial. This does have some planning advice - but the main value for this book is to make sure that you get not only the best price for what you buy - but the best quality and customer care as well. I consider this a must, along with a good wedding planner that has lists to check off."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only wedding planning book worth the money!","review":"I bought several wedding planning books, and was given a couple of others. Although they all had helpful hints, this one was definitely worth my money! The hints are fantastic, and the section on scams that bridal salons try to pull is shocking! Definitely read this book before buying your wedding dress. I recommend this book to all brides-to-be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful!","review":"This book was so informative! And a great place to start when I didn't know anything about wedding planning. It has great tips and sets out common pitfalls to avoid. It also lists questions to ask vendors before signing contracts. I've loaned this book to two friends who got married recently, and they loved it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased as a gift.","review":"I purchased this book as a gift for my niece.

As far as I'm concerned, there should be.ALSO....the reason you don't see too many bad reviews is the authors have them removed !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be NO stars!","review":"Totally useless fluff for the self-indulgent bride.

Im not a bride rushing to the alter because all i could think about was MONEY,MONEY,MONEY. And to be honest I was going to postpone my wedding just out of stress an my wedding is 2 years from now lol but this book has actually made me excited! Its very inciteful! I mean you get sooo much information! and im just reading about Apparell, Im only 100 pages in! Me and My future husband thank you because I was very negative about the wedding because I thought we were going to spend so much!

TRUST ME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed and Organized","review":"I just got engaged and this was the first book I purchased. There is a lot of details, and the book is laid out very well.

I ended up buying my beautiful wedding gown, (beaded, with a long train and bustle) for $35.00 at Goodwill (which undoubtedly cost over $1000.00 brand new), my sister found her MOH dress at a bargain price as well (leftover prom dress at a HUGE discount at a local department store) and the advice about flowers, cakes and photographers was phenomenal. We spent our money on the things we felt were important (venue, photographer) and we ended up having a brilliant time! Eight years later, we look back and think about what a FUN wedding we had, with zero regrets about $$ spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful tool!","review":"This book was very helpful! I loved that it was broken down into different categories and it had a lot of great websites included!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the bridal-gown section alone","review":"You must buy this book if you are planning a wedding. You MUST buy this book! Buy it the minute you get engaged. Do not go dress shopping or to a bridal fair until you read it. The section on dresses outlines so many tips that you will feel like an expert when you walk in the door of any bridal shop. I read this and, using one of their tips, purchased a bridesmaid's dress for my informal wedding for $150 -- $300 less than the shop was charging for a nearly identical bride's dress! I can't recommend this book highly enough!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"I read the whole book while planning my wedding. I even used some of the advice. The biggest thing I learned from this is bargain bargain bargain! Don't agree with the first quote you are given. I was able to haggle down everything I needed to a reasonable price. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If You're Planning A Wedding - Get This Book!","review":"I just got this book today and it has already helped me so much!

The item was barely used and I'm sure by now, my daughter finished reading it - said it had great tips. Thanks for a good price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any bride","review":"This book was unbelievably helpful while I was planning my wedding. It has tons of great references to specific web sites and places for great deals for a wedding. It's not about taking shortcuts on your wedding. It shows you how to get exactly what you want for your day but at an affordable price. My biggest two take aways from this book were to buy my dress online ( I got a beautiful custom dress from $300) and to buy my flowers in bulk and arrange them with family. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great !","review":"I ordred this book and it was so worth it ! Easy to read ad very down to earth, honest wedding advice. We are paying for our own wedding annd with today's economy, and a strict budget, we needed all the guidance we could get. This book is very helpful ! I would highly recommend it to every couple planning their wedding !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brides-to-be can't \\"be\\" without it!","review":"This comprehensive guide gives great money saving tips and insights to the unsuspecting bride. Unless you have an unlimited budget and the brains of Einstein, you need this book! From buying your dress to the champagne toast, this book provides vital information on the bridal industry and how to avoid becoming its victim. Each chapter is easy to read and filled with great ideas. While your head is in the clouds dreaming of your perfect day, this book is a great reality check! I won't let go of my copy until the wedding, but after that, it will be the perfect engagment gift for my next lucky friend.Also, if you like this one, the same authors offer another book just about shopping for dresses. (I wish I had found it before buying mine.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, readible joy","review":"I am so glad I caught the tiny review for this book in a newspaper last March (2003). Bridal Bargains is great for anyone planning a wedding, whether you're on a budget or not. The numerous tips this book offers on gowns alone make it invaluable. Each chapter is thorough without being monotonous, and funny without being cute.The things you learn in this book about the wedding industry are so unbelievable, you won't forget them, which will serve you well once you get ready to hire that caterer or alter that gown. It's pretty horrifying to see how many pitfalls there are, but the Fields are determined to arm you with all the information you need. It's an incredible resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to the bridal universe","review":"Packed with actual specific information about how to save money on your wedding purchases, this book is a must-have for anyone even thinking of planning a wedding. Unlike many books in this category which provide vague advice on cutting costs, this book provides names of companies along with contact phone numbers and even web addresses to help you get what you want at a better price. The information on finding a wedding gown for less was invaluable as was the heads-up on the deceptive practice of tearing labels out of dresses to prevent comparison shopping. I highly recommend reading this book before you set foot in a bridal store!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book on How not to get ripped off; good practical advice","review":"I liked the organization of the book; great advice on what to avoid and tips on what questions to ask to avoid getting ripped off.

Great supplement book to any other guide you have."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are planning a wedding this is the best book out!","review":"I don't usually take the time to write reviews but this book was so helpful I was compelled to.

Rural areas do not apply to most of the book. The best tip however was the detail about David's Bridal and their lack of customer service. Very true!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and quiet","review":"When we first received the gun, all the mechanics thought it wasn't powerful enough. It was just a figment of their imagination as the gun is SUPER quiet. Works best with 1/2\\" airline and adjust pressure to regulate torque. No complaints, has lasted 3 times longer then the 3/4\\" snap on and this one is still going strong."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truly essential Hitchcock...","review":"Bluray updates aren't necessary on these. The some and picture quality are fantastic. I've watched these through dlp on a 35 foot screen in up converted 1080p and they were really good. The titles in the set were all my favorite Hitchcock movies. I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not acceptable","review":"I agree with those saying shame on Universal.To reissue (with identical art on the DVDs themselves) the same films (plus North by Northwest, not really sure how Universal wrangled the rights to that from Warners) six years after they were last reissued on DVD is beyond pointless. It's an insult. I have seen no indication that these are even new masters or will have any new special features than the 2005 Masterpiece Collection versions of these titles. In fact, the North by Northwest DVD seems to have significantly LESS in the special features department than prior discs.In 2011 to be releasing on DVD for the THIRD (!) time the same Hitchcock classics that should have been announced for Blu-ray is embarassing. Universal is actively insulting the public, plain and simple.And for those saying this is not a product review, it is. This product is trying to fool the consumer into making them think it is a new, or improved, product. It isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...How did that happen?!?","review":"I ordered the Essentials Collection as it included all of the Hitchcock titles that I wanted. It arrived with two DVD's of \\"The Birds\\", but no \\"North by Northwest\\". Did this happen to anyone else?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Hitchcock BLU-RAYS, Universal?","review":"Seriously, Universal? Another pointless reissue of regular DVD titles? We are still waiting for Rear Window, Vertigo, The Birds on blu-ray!! I've had The Birds on pre-order since last October. We have Psycho and North by Northwest in HD and they are superb! Here you are, sitting on a 70mm master of Hitchcock's greatest film \\"Vertigo\\" and blu-ray has been out for 5+ years and you've only given us 1 title that you own! Shame on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed where are the Blu Rays???","review":"I grabbed up the Psycho and North by Northwest Blus on day of release it is a crime not to release this set in Blu, or at least my fav, REAR WINDOW... Where are the blus???????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection at a good price.","review":"My wife was mentioning (hinting) to me one day that there were a few Hitchcock films she would like to have on DVD some day. I immediately went to Amazon to look for the films she mentioned and all four of them were in this collection plus Psycho which was a favorite of mine. The extras in this package are not as thorough as some but we were not interested in much more than a good copy of the films and you get that here and at a much lower price than the ones with all the bells and whistles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alfred Hitchcock:The Essentials","review":"They were Great!And i kept watching them over and over again. The price was worth it!And we all enjoyed them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift for a Hitchcock fan.","review":"This was a gift and it was well received. Has many of the Hitchcock classics all in one. And not too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"No teachings to be found in this book, bad title.","review":"I read this book twice. The second time with a highlighter. I found only about one page of actual teachings on how one can gain the abilities that he says his teacher has. His second book is even worse, it just repeats what is in this book.Don't get me wrong I have studied the internal arts for years now and I truly believe that what he says his teacher can do can be done. But this is not the book to learn them from. He even says at one point that he does not give the instruction for fear of these powers falling into the wrong hand. Frankly the largest failing of this book is that it is very poorly written.Honestly don't bother, read instead \\"The Magus of Strovolos\\" a much better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining yes...but legit?","review":"Yes, the book was entertaining and features some interesting possibilities with energy, however:1) The author keeps mentioning is engineering background, yet gives entirely subjective charts that any junior high schooler can make.2) His few references to Star Wars or Highlander or whatever the childish movies are, detract from the semi-serious look at an energy worker. It sounds more like the fantasies of child.3) The description of the many levels seems suspect.4) The \\"Mo Pai\\" tradition is touted, but there are NO solid examples given of how it might relate to other traditions.But this IS an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stimulating book","review":"Mr. Danaos is very sincere in his desire to relate his experiences to the world. This book is basically a relation of his experiences with the neikung master John Chang, and a discussion of theory on yin and yang energy. The author does his job very well with the exception of the epilogue, where he basically rants on and on about what a terrible state the world is in due to greed and the spoiling of nature. It's kind of an anticlimatic end to a very good book. (Also, he mentions the Jedi too much)Fact or fiction? It does not matter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for people who already understand","review":"This book is a great read for those who already understand the concepts of Internal alchemy. This is not a how to book and if that's why you are buying the book you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magus of Java: Teachings of an Authentic Taoist Immortal","review":"It is one of the most interesting books that I have ever read in the recent years. It is really a page-turner, and an easy read like a fairy tale or a martial art novel. It also talks a bit about their fundamental training and theory. It may be a good book to look more into the trainings in China in the old days re eternal life.What the Master has been practicing is not Taoism, but something passed down from Mo Tsu. (Black Ink Son) No wonder we Chinese have never heard about this 72 levels in Taoism.All the feats in the book are quite difficult to believe. Treat it like a fairy tale novel and we will enjoy reading it. The book is more on interesting stories than info on training methods."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book for Kids just hitting Puberty","review":"I have spent ten years practicing in the esoteric traditions. I was very excited to get this book after watching the John Chang video on youtube. I think John Chang has great potential and a book about him and his adventures would be equally great. Unfortunately, we are limited by the writing style of someone with a real intellect and emotional maturity of a 16 year old. I guess it could be exciting if I was 16. I read many, many hardcore technical books but I find reading this non-technical book very difficult to follow. I think if we had a better interviewer, we could have gotten really good information from John Chang. Unfortunately, the writing style here is my penis is bigger than your penis.I give this 2 stars for the potential it could offer. I just wished the writer had some spiritual development. It's a shame that someone with a emotional maturity of a 16 year old is allowed to write a book on the teachings of a taoist immortal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance conclusion","review":"The author, as he claims having engineering background, definitely has forgotten it completely. He acrobatically proposes models and takes conclusion such an ignorance person. The trick employed is cheap and draws the the sceptics even further. While the topic may indeed true, this book just makes it fraudelent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Values and choices","review":"There are many of us interested in the human potential movement and ecological wholeness. We read Redfield, Millman, Capra, and others as we try and develope those qualities we value. Some of mine are health, compassion, strength, awareness, and vision.The 'character' in this book can light paper on fire and move objects with his internal energy. He also smokes cigarettes, drives recklessly, and eats animals.This is not the path for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the....have we learned nothing from Houdini?","review":"This book is complete fiction and is insulting to the educated reader who is not willing to believe you can buy the Brooklyn Bridge. Perhaps the author Danaos, (AKA Dervenis), should have studied up on Taoism before writing a book, it would have helped a great deal with the content, the facts and the non-fictionality of it all. For example, most of the \\"masters\\" mentioned in this book are Buddhist, not Taoist. It seems that one studying so \\"deeply\\" should know the difference. Most importantly, any magician worth their salt could perform these tricks...where is Harry Houdini when you need him?Don't waste you money on this book. Buy \\"Magic the Gathering\\" cards if you want to stock up on your Mana. At least they will be worth something when you are tired of looking at them.If you want a book on Taoism, seek it elsewhere.Puhhhlease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"Finally, an up to date book that is filled with the spirit of TRUTH. For Martial Artists or anyone interested in finding out how Yin and Yang work inside of our bodies and how it can be used, this is the Book.This book is written about a Master (John Chang) who is using these energies to amazing degrees. And this man lives among us Today! He is not a Master who lived hundreds or thousands of years ago. And Better yet. Kosta (Chang's Student) lets us know that we can go find this man ourselves and maybe learn how to become like him \\"If it is in your Karma to do so\\"This book has so much TRUTHFULL, HELPFULL and HOPEFULL information in it that it has changed my life. Literally.Read it and then Read Kosta's second book on the subject. -V-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"This is a fascinating book; however, you'll have to be open-mined in order to appreciate this book. I wish more books like this are published to help people realize the full potential of a human being. I'm glad to hear that such a human being with such capabilies exist today.

It is also incorrect that a family who would bother to wear yalmulka's, and say blessings and prayers would serve \\"brisket, and sour cream\\" at the holiday meal. (There is no such tradition --at least not one of Jewish origin.) Even those who do not keep kosher eat applesauce with their potato pancakes.

Couldn't bear the challenge of the diet then, but now see it as a necessity for life. Lisa has wonderful recipes that have saved me -particularly the easier ones that are quick to pull together. I can't imagine going GFCF without this and volume 2. Would, however, love the authors to provide an updated edition!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book saved my grandson's life.","review":"this book convinced my grandson's parents that he may be autistic and in need of a similar diet that the one described on the book. When my grandson's other grandmother read it after I sent it to her, she called me to say she could not put the book away thinking that our little boy was exactly like Lisa's son. We found a DAN doctor and put him on treatment early enough that now he is in regular school and doing very well. I don't think the book is intended to provide a magical diet for every child in the spectrum. But it provides wonderful information about how what you eat can make you sick and that an adequate individualized diet may help your child. I loved her story, her courage and her determination to help her child get better. It was so helpful for us, I will always be thankful to Lisa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Information","review":"I found this book to be extremely informative and would recommend it to anyone considering a special diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted.","review":"My husband ordered this book when we decided to put my son on a gluten-free diet. I was looking mainly for a gluten-free cookbook with some helpful hints included. Half the book is about the author's story and theories about why the diets in this book should be followed. For the most part I don't agree with her theories. The cookbook part is okay but so far has not really been the taste of my family. Also there are a lot of recipes for muffins and desserts which I don't really need because stores have a lot of gluten-free snacks. I am really looking for more meals I can cook my family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science + Food = Healthy Kids","review":"It's books like this that make me realize organic chemistry really would have been a good class to finish. If I had known then that I would someday have a kid on the spectrum, I would have. This is a fantastic first dive into the science of the gut of ASD kids explaining the hows and whys of the GFCF diet along with lots of other important things like leaky guts and the evils of partially hydrogenated vegetable oil. The first half of the book is science class and the second is some great recipes. This is a very important book to own if you're serious about going GFCF - I reference it often. It even includes recipes for holiday dishes like matzo balls and thanksgiving stuffing. My only complaint is the lack of index for the recipes. Other than that, this is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Thorough!","review":"My only complaint about this book is that I wish I hadn't purchased the hardback spiral version because it is just too bulky and a little outdated on some of the ingredients. So much has gotten easier since gluten-free eating has become more necessary and common for people, and some of the recipes refer to items that I think are much easier to find these days than when this copy was published. Otherwise, a very good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great source for starting the GFCFSF lifestyle","review":"I had dabbled in the GFCFSF (Gluten Free, Casein Free, Soy free) food regime for my little one with Autism.In all the sites I ventured to, they mentioned this book.And now I know why...she started this regime when there was no regime. A true forerunner, this book is essential for anyone beginning a special meal plan for their children, or even themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"So very beautiful","review":"I found that \\"notre clavecinist canadien\\", M. Wright, stated very well what I also feel. This is music of the highest order, noble in tone, deeply feeling but restrained, beautiful in both harmony and melody. The instrument's warmth and exceptional richness of timbre never detracts from its essential clarity of speech. Mr. Rousset's command of the instrument, the idiom, the complex repertory of ornamentation, and not least the gallant spirit of the music itself is commendable.My only reservations are with his tendency occasionally to rush dotted notes, and, in a few instances, to toss off certain of the lighter pieces a bit too hastily. But let this be \\"praising with faint damning\\"!Anyone who loves late 17th century French music should purchase this gem!J. v.Lennep, \\"luthier americain\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Legal Document Production","review":"Great book and extremely helpful.

A big part of my job is interview and interrogation. This book was able to put into context what I have already been doing for a number of years.

The booklet gives detailed on band members and the individual recordings, and AMERICA's music has been shining for 30 years now.If there's one thing that could have been improved with this collection it's that - in my opinion - later efforts by Gerry & Dewey (who have been a duo for 23 years already!) like material from \\"Hourglass\\" or \\"Human Nature\\" are almost forgotten, while this box set's focus is especially on the first three albums from 1972-74.The usual \\"unreleased\\" tracks are pasted to the end of disc three (why? everything else is arranged in strictly chronological order) and sound so much like \\"demos\\" that they should have been left off this set altogether. There would have been more room for recent stuff or some of Gerry's solo work.Otherwise - you'll get a lot of good music for your money. And make sure to go out and see AMERICA on tour one of these days, they're still brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection if you don't already have all their albums","review":"This is a great collector's edition of America's fave hits. I have been an America fan since 1978 but have only now been able to complete all of their albums on CD. Thanks to Amazon.com, this is where I found all the rest of America's album that previously have been hard to find for me. With this box set, it brings it all to full circle. It is comforting to know America has not been gone and forgotten. They have been and will always be my favorite group. Now, the only thing to top it off is a concert on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"memory lane","review":"i listened to many of these songs when i was a yong man. the memories alone were worth the purchase price. if you are an america fan, this is a must have item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMERICA - 3 Decades making quality music","review":"At last an outstanding compilation of the music of one of the finest soft rock bands to reach earth.

It is a really fun movie to watch and it captures the feeling of the wealth and splendor that colonial Brazil was. Xica is a slave who uses her seductive talents and sexuality to seduce powerful men to get to the highest social status possible. It is a fasinating story and the cinematography captures many sights of the old and beautiful city of Ouro Preto in the State of Minas Gerais. It is Great for any one who wants to begin learning aobut the history of the fantastic country of Brazil. Se mostra Brazil numa boa! O filme vale a pena!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Encompasses complexity of race in Brazil","review":"While this movie may not be the \\"best\\" that Brazilian cinema has to offer, I think that it provides a detailed look into the complexities of race in Brazil, especially its historical origins. Note the difference in how the Brazilian-born diamond govt. employee treats Xica versus the pretentious Portuguese nobleman. This difference symbolizes the very thing that makes race relations in Brazil so hard to explain to foreigners, especially Americans. It also has some kick-tushy music by Jorge Ben; you'll finish the movie humming the continuous theme of the movie \\"Xica da.. Xica da.. Xica da Silva\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"what brazilians think of afro-brazilian women","review":"A racist film that uses exotica and the most rabid stereotypes of black sexuality to sell a flawed product.

However, after giving the CD a listen, I feel only marginally satisfied. The new album is missing the unique sound and upbeat vibe that made \\"Life of Saturdays\\" such a great album. There is definitely no song on the album that even begins to approach the quality of \\"Leaving Town\\".I think that \\"Prozak\\" and \\"How Do I Get Through To You\\" do have merit. \\"Prozak\\" is an upbeat song about wanting to be one of the \\"cool guys\\" with a bit of a punk flavor comparable to the Fountains of Wayne song \\"Stacie's Mom\\". \\"How Do I Get Through To You\\" is a rock ballad that sounds a bit like something \\"Lifehouse\\" or \\"The Calling\\" might produce.I want Dexter Freebish to be around and producing great music for a long time to come, but I'm afraid that this album might not ensure their longevity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wow!","review":"I first heard this band roughly four years ago (early 2000?). I remember being completely blown away by their first CD, Life of Saturdays. I bought copies for all my friends and it remains one of my favourites to this day. About a month ago, I was shocked when DF managed to top themselves with Tripped into Divine. It is an absolute must-have album. The songs Twilight and Wild Things are nearly indescribable. Simply incredible! I strongly recommend this album for those lucky enough to have heard Dexter Freebish before and those who have not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort the cards before you waste valuable time!","review":"These cards include items not covered on the GMAT. My advice is to sort through the cards and throw away the ones that don't apply. It seems like they just took the SAT cards and put them in a new box.

Don't use this as your only guide to studying for the GMAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little real GMAT material","review":"when comparing GMAT books and the study cards, they don't really have much in common.

Slowly over the course of the book Molly comes to see that the rain isn't a pain, it's great and even better than \\"Rain rain go way\\" is \\"Sun sun go away.\\" I really liked the watercolor illustrations as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost...but not quite","review":"While this book addresses all of the cognitive processes needed to take the test, as well as the types of questions the Praxis test MAY have, I found the typographical errors and editing oversights to be distracting. Particularly frustrating examples of this occurred in answer key to the sample test. As I was reviewing, I found that the explanations of some correct answers did not correspond with the letter given as correct. It made me question how many of the others that I did NOT scrutinize, had the same problem.

I grew up on this album. In fact it was the 1st Cash LP that I ever owned. Growing up I never knew it but for those of us who owned this first on vinyl it was highway robbery. Don't get me wrong I loved it, but Columbia Records could have released more of the show. It is nice to finaly have the whole show, however I would like to see a DVD release of the show without inmate comments. Just the entire Cash show from start to finish and not just footage of it. As for a piece of history I loved the DVD too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Cash at his best !","review":"This combination of two CD's and a DVD are top knotch. The documentary of his visit to San Quentin is riveting, and the songs can't be beat. Others have already gone into detail about this, so I won't. This was given to me as a gift, and I waited a year before indulging in it. My bad. I return to it regularly, now and thoroughly enjoy it. If you love country music; real \\" cotton field country \\"; and not the warmed-over classic rock that passes for country in 2012, you'll really dig the DVD and the music. The price can't be beat, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must - Have Collection","review":"Finally, the entire concert presented - not edited as in previous releases. While there are a couple of added Johnny Cash songs, there are excellent performanced by the Carter Family, Carl Perkins, and The Statler Brothers.As an added bonus, you get the DVD of the concert that was recorded for Granada TV in England. Unfortunately, it's a little grainy and not alot of effort has been made to clean it up (as we've seen with other DVDs), but it's still a \\"Must Have\\" for any Johnny Cash fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phooey.","review":"Well, you get what you pay for.

I read a review on another item that summarized my feelings for this one... \\"this item discourages children from becoming interested in science\\".

Although I identified with Hilary in my life experience, Kate Montgomery's vivid language inspired me to laugh out loud, shake my head in disbelief and brought tears to my eyes (which doesn't happen much when I read books). Kate has more mettle than anyone I know. I wish they'd be separated again and we'd have more letters to read. If you went to college and had a best friend, you'll love this book. My husband read the book after becoming interested in my reactions to the story. He enjoyed it as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug","review":"I looked for the friendship purported in this book. Instead of letters to eachother, these were clearly letters to posterity. What a lonely world if this can pass as intimacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Africa here!","review":"This is not about two friends, this book is about one self-absorbed New Yorker and the grander woman she corresponds with on an African peace corp mission. Kate's story is amazing but not expressed enough so that you are frustrated wanting to know more. Hilary's story is the total opposite with a life that is about material possessions and her sex life.

So I ordered them on Amazon in bulk.Unfortunately, as of today, Amazon still has the wrong ingredients list. What arrived was the new formulation of this product, which is no longer organic. The company now uses the label \\"all natural\\" instead, and most of the ingredients are not organic.Excellent customer service on Snikkidy's end; they were forthcoming about the issue and apologized that Amazon hasn't updated the information yet, even though I understand they have no control over that.I will probably continue buying these snacks despite that they're no longer organic.

The only other feedback I was allowed to send - besides this one - was on the packaging! These mac and cheese puffs are the best snack product ever to have graced our family's home.

However after eating a few in a row, there is a bad after taste that can upset your stomach.They are also not very cheesy and the product does not resemble the taste of a grilled cheese in any way, shape or form.I'm still looking for the perfect cheese puff, but these will not be on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Period Piece","review":"I found myself contrasting this opera with \\"War and Peace\\" finding much similar.

TWO WEEKS later (and making several more calls to tech support) someone finally got back to me. Fortunately he was very helpful and my issue was finally resolved.

He lays bare the truth behind the myths we've all grown up believing, and the result is something of an expose, providing such startling conclusions as the fact that the Greeks actually outnumbered the Persians at the battle of Marathon!While much of Delbruck's writing seems to fly in the face of accepted convention, he does such a masterful job of backing up his conclusions with hard facts and indisputable logic that one is rapidly converted to his way of thinking. These books are a rarity in a society that still takes ancient history at face value: Delbruck digs deep to find the truth, and as a result these works (the entire series is fantastic) are vital reading for anyone interested in truly understanding the history of warfare. I can't reccommend these books highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"antiquity is not barbarian invasions","review":"Delbruk took a critical look at accepted accounts of battles, did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, and showed how most of these accounts were simply implausible.

So, a second source giving those implausible accounts should be kept handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but a bit hard to read","review":"The book is not just a window to the Ancient World military history but also to the scholar writing of late 18th Century. You really need to be concentrated to fight with the annotations at the end of each chapter which often take more pages than the own chapter.Many of the conclusions (just a sample, the relative sizes of Greek and Spartan armies or the actual location of the Marathon battle) are so in contradiction with everything we have learned that one would like to be an archeologist in position to go the (alternative) sites and search for evidences. It would be really nice to know if someone has already done it.

It is a compilation containing samples from albums recorded during more than 30 years that this accomplished musician invested into the world of music. The selection was influenced by Keith's revisiting his old recordings. Hence, the transition between some tracks may seem at times disconnected.

This 2-cd set nearly takes up 160 minutes of some mighty fine piano work (and some fairly annoying clavicle playing) enhanced with some of the most bizarre, madcap stomping and moaning I have ever heard. The moans this Keith Jarrett character makes when digging for inspiration drives my wife's annoying tabby (Bobo!)absolutely bonkers. In truth, the grunting sounds very much like a cat being tortured and I think somehow Bobo is disturbed by this. I have only seen his hair stand up on end once or twice before, but everytime Keith grunts, electroshocko! Bobo runs wild. I loooooove it and would highly recommend this to folks who dig piano and enjoy watching cats run wild (and I do mean wild). What a combo!!! ECM = Electro Cat Motion!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great starter book as well as an advanced resource.","review":"This book gives you comprehensive advice on starting and appreciating a butterfly garden in a small, and easily digestible package.

I used this saw hard a bunch of times cutting firewood, felling trees, hurricane debris, just about everything you could think of in FL. I have never had any problems and the saw always starts. One mod I would have done a long time ago is dremel off the keepers on the needle valves to richen up the high speed a little. This would keep it from getting hot after a couple hours of use. This saw seems like it will last me much longer, I just bought a 20\\" bar for mine today and will see how that works out. I wore out the 18 it came with. This is a great saw and the only thing I have had to replace is a fuel line from the gas tank to the carb but a 5 year old engine I would think would need more than that.

It is a good book for learning Greek but as another reviewer stated Mounce's book is better and the book by George A. Hadjiantoniou is a good one as well. If you want a book to sit on the shelf then this is fine. If you plan to actually read and study from it you may end up with a majority of the pages falling out.

Quirk tries to write in slang associated with each of the pop culture references but ends up sounding like a stammering 15 year old. The Ultimate Rush has been hailed as the first major novel about rollerblading but anyone interested in the sport will see (and Quirk admitted this in a issue of a blading magazine) that the descriptions are extremely inaccurate.

I was looking forward to reading the novel, as I'm a huge fan of the TV show Sex in the City, and I'm a fan of the \\"20/30 something female looking for love\\" genre. But this book fell flat. Some of the events were mildly amusing, but not funny enough to warrant the length of the book. The foul language seemed [unreal] -- as though it was there more to shock the reader than anything. The sex scenes were boring. And, worst of all, there was no character development at all. Even some of the flimiest novels I've read paid some attention to giving the characters a bit of depth.

She ends up temping while writing a \\"trials and tribulations\\" (read \\"sex\\") column in a local paper. A premise that could have been funny ends up being slightly boring. Ariel tries to appear as a bad girl, using phrases like \\"he ground my beef\\", but ends up having to make up the dirtiest parts of her column. And then, when she gets notoriety, the way she wanted, she whines about it. I just couldn't really care about the character of Ariel at all.For a more entertaining, and less graphic, story about trying to make it in the big city and failed hopes, try reading \\"In the Drink\\" by Christiansen. As for this being \\"the thinking person's Bridget Jones\\" (yes, it says that on the back cover), I beg to disagree. These are very different books. Bridget is purely trying to entertain.

Her love life is less than active, so after dating a few guys, she makes things up, changes some names, and publishes them in her column.Her attempts at relationships are desperate at best.

I finished about half of it, just out of sheer curiosity and obviously didn't purchase it. It's amusing if only because of what poorly written, self-important, right out of the gutter sewer sludge it is. The protaganist is self-absorbed, humorless and unlikeable. I'm not sure if this is supposed to be satirical or some kind of ironic twist on this sort of coming-of-age-20-something-hip-post-feminist genre, but I'm afraid it's not because I think the author expects us to actually RELATE to the main character and take her seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"The subject sounded fun and interesting(and I loved the cover), so I bought this book. But be forewarned: the writing is awful. In addition, the self-absorbed narrator turned my stomach. I couldn't imagine enjoying a single moment with Ariel, so the idea of finishing the book was unbearable.I am in 24, and this book skewed way too young for my taste. Perhaps it would be appealing to the teen market?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me wish I were illiterate","review":"The pathetic narcissism of the book's main character, the unbelievably bad writing, the flat, shallow caricatures -- oops, I mean characters -- made this book a waste of time, money and valuable trees.I picked this book hoping to get a frank, funny, and honest story. Instead what I got was a couple of hundred pages of unfiltered, contrived bilge. Man, did this book stink. If only I could give it zero stars ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, very witty","review":"I had enjoyed Amy Sohn's columns for a while before reading this, and I confess that the possibility that this was based on her life after coming to New York (tho I know it's fiction) interested me first. But I found the book very well written, with some real clever humor in it. Even though there are a lot of books out now about dating in the city, I think her book's plot is still original enough to shine through. Quick summary: Ariel Steiner (yes, note the initials) has her dating/life-in-NY column picked up by a local weekly newspaper, and must attempt to balance her need to write about love with her actual need to find love. There is also the problem of having your family (including your little brother) be able to pick up the paper and read about your lovelife. It had me hooked. It was carefully written rather than quick. I enjoyed the ending, too. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"Like many others, I bought this book thinking it would be a New York version of Bridget Jones' Diary. Not so. It was more like \\"Bridget Does Brooklyn\\" .. and Manhattan ... and Queens. I could have stomached the crude (and incessant) sex scenes if the main character, Ariel, had been the slightest bit sympathetic. Don't waste your money! Try Rita Ciresi's \\"Pink Slip\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, just run.","review":"ummmmm...what? Non sensical AND none senSATional. A parade of boring sex and self promotion. Couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book","review":"I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I don't think I have ever laughed out loud so many times while reading. I thought Ariel was very easy to like, but I don't quite understand her taste in guys. Don't read this if you want something deep, but it is great for reading by the pool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed out loud.","review":"I liked this book because of the sassy dialogue and quick wit of Ariel. She had a million and one slang terms for sex and certain male and female body parts that just had me rolling. Sure the main character was a nympho, and some of the situations were totally unbelievable, but it was all in all a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and Fun","review":"If you like Sex and the City you'll love this book. This book is about a 21 year old sex columnist in New York that is looking for love--and herself--in all the wrong places. There is great humor and some parts where you laugh out loud or cringe because you can't believe what the Ariel, the main character, has gotten herself into. So much better than The Girl's guide to Hunting and Fishing, Bridget Jones' Diary, The Cigarette Girl, or Neurotica. The author is witty and funny and there is occasional Jewish humor that anyone can laugh at."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUMMY JUICY LIPS!","review":"Um, I really don't have much to say. I laughed. Sometimes. And then. I didn't. And then, I finished the book, and started another one. It's all a part of the cycle. Not a huge waste of money, but, don't get excited, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muffin shop hottie","review":"I haven't read the book but I've seen Amy at the muffin shop. I just wish I could be fodder for her literary hands. Maybe I'll write a book about my fantasies of Amy. Maybe someone will pay me for them. Go girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book I read today for which I like","review":"Pardon at first my English being so-not good.For once I was in the read of RUNCATCHKISS of Amy Sohn together in. Never read about of subject before I have. From, begin to the ending, I could not put down RUNCATCHKISS. Sohn remind me of before \\"girlfriend\\" I've have.But her use of talking words in RUNCATCHKISS, like as \\"vagina\\" very shocking. Come to the place many times before, what is this one for to come here?I would, read again Sohn RUNCATCHKISS, but next time more picture?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read an enjoyable book.","review":"I also went to the reading on Monday night. The bookstore was packed and the crowd enjoyed the ironic reading given by Ms. Sohn. She was pleasant and friendly in person -- hardly the desperate, self-loathing temptress that her puritanical detractors want her to be. This book will not feed you or help you lose weight. It also went prevent pattern baldness or make you a better dancer. What it will do is entertain you for several hours. I'm looking forward to her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run Buy Read","review":"I read a lot of books, but rarely do I laugh out loud like I did when reading Ms. Sohn's book. It's nice to read the dating trials and tribulations of real woman -- Strangely enough I liked best the descriptions of her parents' reactions to her racy column, although certainly the stories are hysterical as well. If you're looking for something fun to read, this book is great. If you're a single woman living in New York, this book is superlative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read great reviews and read this book in a couple of days, but was somewhat disappointed, expecting something more...the premise was promising, but I couldn't work up much feeling for the character. Talk about self-absorbed, imagining the whole city was aghast over her column? I think not! Unerotic pointless sex scenes, over and over...let me tell you, if you want to read a good book about a single Jewish gal yearning for love and marriage, go to the library and get out \\"Sheila Levine Is Dead and Living in New York City\\". A wonderful funny touching novel about a young woman in a New York that is no more, but much better written (not to be confused with a horrible movie by the same name). \\"Run Catch Kiss\\" confirms two things, a) that men can put their you know whats in anything and its no more than a sneeze, and b) I am so very glad I'm not a young woman living in New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Bad","review":"It's bad.Is she trying to be Bridget Jones? Don't know. She should have tried to put together a decent story.I got it as a gift, so I didn't lose any money. But, I'll never get my time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"Vacuous, poorly written, and self-indulgent. Don't waste your time or money on this truly stupid book. I'm from New York and I disliked it so much, it's the first book I've ever thrown away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex for anyone....","review":"Please, oh please, do not waste your time on this book, (I won't even call it a novel). I have read bad books, but this one...not a smile, not one laugh, not one tear, not ANYTHING!!! This book has no emotion at all...I fear she (author) was trying to be oh-so-urban-bitch-of-the-nineties!"},{"rating":"1","title":"run on","review":"I'm afraid that in my opinion (only one person, admittedly) what works wonderfully in a magazine column makes poor book fodder. Though I wanted to look deeper, there was no surface to scratch....because underneath the brash, glitzy exterior of this novel is another surface: It is like a plastic onion in revealing lingerie. Those of you mining for nuggets of hard-won wisdom will probably go without. Some laughs, to be fair, several good ones.... but mostly sighs of boredom. Perhaps this is just the book the author had to get out the way before she could write something more worthy of her talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible waste of time and brain cells","review":"I'm all for fluffy books about 20 somethings and their dating disasters, and can accept trashy novels for what they are: fun. But this book is so poorly written, the characters so one dimensional, the plot development similar to that of a 1st graders book report. I couldn't stop reading it because I couldn't believe that such junk had managed to get published. The upside is I'm convinced that I could get my own bad novel published if I really try hard enough. This book is just terrible, no other words to describe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sick of female twenty somethings being portrayed as des","review":"I am so sick of twenty something females being portrayed as desperate sluts. Enough already! Amy Sohn is so concerned with staus that every single character in the novel went to an ivy league school. Give me a break!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No stars for this trash","review":"This was boring, remarkably UNsexy and terribly written. It is below Jackie Collins in storytelling. The whole thing was so awful-I couldn't finish it. I was, however, compelled to write my first Amazon review!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Low grade Porn","review":"Not to mention boring. Ariel comes across as obnoxious and self-absorbed, the writing is flat, and the subject matter is banal. Run, Drop, Spit on this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have written a memoir instead","review":"As a writer, I know all about authors using isolated events or aspects of their lives fictitiously in novels. But Amy Sohn's Run Catch Kiss has missed the mark between fiction and memoir. It becomes certain that she took events straight out of her life and put them in the contents of this book -- or rather, wrote an autobiography disguised as a novel, period.The novel itself is trite and insubstantial. But what I could expect from a story about a wannabe-actress-turned-sex columnist? I don't think that a heroine who writes about her sexual escapades in a newspaper column is my kind of read. I borrowed this book from a friend. I now wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"If I ever run into Amy Sohn on the street I am going to ask for my money back. Seriously. This book was a feeble and weak attempt at writing. I think that more than the money, I regret losing every minute of my time that was wasted reading this book. I am all for a thrilling read and witty and provacative fare, but Amy Sohn is nothing more than a boring, remedial, and thoroughly uninteresting exhibitionist. Maybe Amy Sohn should keep the money - she has no career as a novelist. I'm cancelling my New York Magazine subscription too."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrid","review":"I have never thrown out a book, but this one I actually threw into the trash. I managed to read through the entire awful thing thinking it must improve eventually, ever hopeful. The character was just a gross person, hope not too much a reflection on the author herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOT LIKE \\"RUSH HOUR\\"","review":"\\"Drive\\" was surprisingly good. I've seen Mark Dacascos in \\"Only the Strong\\" and \\"The Crow\\" T.V. series. I was very entertained by the action but I wasn't impressed by his acting. He's much better in this movie. There's a ton of action and Dacascos Martial Arts moves are as visualy appealing as anyone in the movies. I thought this film was better then Jackie Chan's \\"Rush Hour\\". The chemistry between Mark Dacascos and Kadeem Hardison is excellent. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Martial Arts action films, it's a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"To pay 30 bucks for a copy or not to pay","review":"*Sigh*I payed 30 bucks on amazon for a copy. Wish it was a tad more clearer before paying 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of this disc. This is not the uk version as pictured on this site -- I can tell ya that much. The movie itself is merely, I assume, a copy of the UK DVD so I'm not too angry about this purchase. It's what's inside that counts...I'm still annoyed that I payed 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of the UK version of Steve Wang's DRIVE (pictured on this amazon page) complete with typos on the box: \\"SPECIAL 116 MINUTE UNCUT VESION\\"I mean I got what I wanted and all...it's just that I payed 30 bucks for a Chinese copy of Steve Wang's Drive. *Sigh*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Drive is a killah!","review":"Drive is some dank stuff. The fighting scenes in this movie are so radical dude. I have never seen such original fighting scenes and moves as in this film. I love how the characters react in the most totally unrealistic ways to far out situations. Like Kadeem Hardison trying to bite off a dead hand from a machine gun! The plot and acting, are of course top quality B movie standards. That probably couldn't get too much worse, but that's not important. The movie is really entertaining and I highly recommend it.

This movie is just crazy! Dacascos shows that in this movie he can move just as fast as the other martial arts heavyweights which is now paying off with his role in Brotherhood of the Wolf. He is very acrobatic combining alot of moves from alot of different styles. Though the not so good plot of this movie only takes up maybe 20% of this movie, believe me the other 80% of fighting is off the hook. Get this movie and keep your eyes open for Mark I have a feeling his popularity is going to rise."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP FLIGHT ACTION FROM BEGINNING TO END!.","review":"I WAS WRONG, I EXPECTED LESS FROM STEVEN WANG.

Besides the thorough section devoted to the producer's influences--the parallels to \\"The Stand\\" and \\"The X-Files\\" are interesting--it was a waste of time. It left me wondering what audience they were targeting with this book--huge Lost fans who are involved in the intertextuality of the show know all of this already, and casual fans won't be bothered by buying books. I also noticed that there is no speculation whatsoever in the book, and that it sticks to the basic facts that we all know already. Plus, it was written before the last episodes of season 2, which are critical to \\"unlocking\\" any meaning behind the show.Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not helpful","review":"What a horrible horrible book.

Also, the guitars in the extra track \\"Boys Republic\\" are very original and hypnotic. This is such a horrible review, but I'm tired. Just know that this CD is great in my book. Good. GREAT. GRAND.

Everything in this book is so finely drawn, from the family members suddenly faced with their own conflicting emotions, to the exquisitely-trained hospital personnel, to the description of the burns themselves.

The main problem with objective interpretation, of which so many of today's non-inspired seem very fond, is that it never allows the subject--or audience--to be involved. As written, Bruckner's Eight is a glorious cathedral, but here, forget about sentiment, personal transcendence, religious experience, finding the meaning to life, or an adventure to Valhalla, it's little more than a study in architecture."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not nice to carp, but..","review":"...the reviewer who gave this astonishing performance three stars because the Adagio movement lacked mystique may lead one to think that Boulez has replace Bruckner's spirit with his own. Actually, that's true, for his version of the Adagio is strcutrually clear, precise, and without much rubato to underline emotion. But for some reason this turns out to be alchemy--the Adagio is one of the greatest things about Boulez's reading.But, then, I should disclose that my Bruckner collection is full of Karajan and Giulini and bare of Wand, Jochum, or Hiatink, all of whome this reviewer extols for mystrique. I find all three flat (even though Haitink performed a wonderful Bruckner Seventh with the BSO in recent seasons and an equaly superb Eighth with the Vinnea Phil in Carnegie Hall)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruckner Surprise","review":"I bought this with some reservation. My opinion of Boulez as a clinical conductor altered when I bought some of his Mahler performances which have shaken much of the dust out of symphonies such as the 7th - and this Bruckner is superb. It is rather like Klemperer's structured view but faster than he would ever have conducted it. The orchestra is ideal and I look forward to more Boulez Bruckner revelations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable at all","review":"I purchased this toy because my small 10 lb. dog destroys all his toys.

It was as if I were transported back to the time when tenors had beautiful, dramatic, exciting voices. Think of Corelli, for example. I thought that maybe this was just the disk (nevertheless, a good reason to buy it). However, I recently saw him sing the Duke in Rigoletto at the Met. The elctricity went on whenever he came on stage (unfortunately, Sumi Jo's dismal Gilda turned the elctricity right off whenever he walked off stage). I love Domingo and Pavarotti. But, Domingo does not excell in this reperatory (i.e., Rigoletto) and as Beautiful as Pavarotti sings, he is not really beliveable in the role. Alvarez' singing on this disk is every bit as exciting as his Met performances. If you think there are no great tenors on the horizon, listen to this to change your mind. I can't wait to here more from Alvarez."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another argentinian is doing great!","review":"This seems to be the age of the great argentinian tenors!

Maybe Marcelo will be considered to record I Puritani with Ruth Ann Swenson (wouldnt that be great?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good foam pump.","review":"The soap shoots straight out of the pump and can go about three feet. (Children would love this feature.) You have to hold your hand awkwardly in front of the spout to keep the soap in your hand or pick up the pump and pump it directly into your palm. Also the pump sticks and has to be pulled up manually. You cannot use this pump with one hand - not good for kitchen use."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better","review":"I ordered this foam pump to make better use of the Dr. Bronners liquid soap that I use. When I saw bad reviews, I hoped to defend it. No. It squirts straight ahead. Sometimes you catch the soap, sometimes the soap hits the wall, sometimes the floor. The pump goes down, but you have to pull it back up.For the price of this pump, I got 6 nice looking plastic pump bottles on eBay that actually work. They look almost as good as this one. The style of this one is OK, but certainly not dramatic enough to make up for the lack of function."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Item","review":"I've used at several different foaming soap dispensers over the years, and this one is not worth the money at all.

If you pressed it, you had to manually pull it back up.I called customer service and spoked to someone, who was very helpful. After trying her suggestions (soap to water ratios, and leaving space at the top for air), I asked to return it and get a refund. She was very understanding and refunded my money quickly.

We use diluted Dr. Bronner's Organic Liquid Castile Soap which we purchase in the 32fl. oz. bottle roughly every eight to ten months. Ocassionaly the dispenser gets gunky but that's mainly because one of us hasn't diluted the soap enough. It does shoot in weird directions when it gets gunky but a little hot water and a toothpick solves that problem. I must admit I was curious about how long we've had the dispensers everyone comments on when they use our guest room, and was shocked it had been so long. It's not a PERFECT product but it's a great buy and if you want to be frugal and environmentally sensitive I say buy it. Four years later you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump broke after a month","review":"This is such a great idea, and mine worked pretty well for a couple weeks, after which the foam started getting big bubbles in it.

It's a fantastic read - exciting, beautifully described, and with a real feel of authenticity about the 16th century. It's not just the drab clothing (bright colours are expensive, and only for best) or the smells (the animals are stabled on the ground floor) it's the attitudes and morals. Fat is attractive. Allegiance is to the family - the Sterkarms - not to truth, or justice, or fair play. And yet you can understand it - that's how things must have been when news travelled slowly, and laws were unenforceable. I believed in this society in a way I rarely have done in other books, and I found myself slowing down at the end because I didn't want to finish it.

The Sterkarms cried to much and they were very ill-minded. Windsor also made me very angry because of his greediness and his stupidity.

The chief protagonist from the sixteenth century, Per, is brought to the 21st Century for medical treatment, and the author's description of his bafflement at modern items - soon to change to growing comprehension - is masterly. She also describes the sights, smells and tastes of the sixteenth century very well. A tad too violent for young teens, but an exceptionally well-written and exciting story for older teens and adults.

Wolf Marshall probably the best guitar signature transcriber around, nails each note perfectly.The problem I have with this is that the notes are played higher up the fretboard than Albert played them.I know he was left handed - playing a right handed guitar upside down (like Hendrix) but did not restring the instrument. He also tuned down one & half tones (3 frets).This makes four note bends impossible on the top string in standard tuning, (YOU WILL PROBABLY BREAK HIGH E STRINGS)which is the way Wolf Marshall recorded it for this package.If you try the DVD from the same company (Hal Leonard) 'Albert King signature licks' by Andy Aledort, you will see them played in the correct positions.Anyway I bought both at the same time & was not sure who to believe.

The plight of the Chechen people is virtually unknown in the U.S. The author points out that Putin, Kofi Annan, and Bush do not or cannot do anything to stop the violence and illegal behavior in Chechnya. Politkovskaya writes her book in a series of short stories that recount the conditions in Chechnya. She personally witnessed some illegal activities, and documents others from victims.

Anna Politkovskaya takes the reader for a non faint of heart journey through the streets of Chechnya- a war torn republic in the North Cuscus. Maybe it was the writing style, but everything just seemed to blend together into a gray portrait of death and survival without dignity. There are no winners Chechen or Russian within the context of Politkovskaya's book. Not even officers of the Russian army as profiled in one of the last stories she tells. War spares no victims and often regenerates itself in the form of a youth who've known nothing but war, replenishing the cycle of war. It's unfortunate that Politkovskaya could not have broken up her stories a little more because though she does a good job of profiling the people of war, much of it is lost in this swirling vortex of near-ending graying death and war."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book","review":"Anna Politkovskaya was one of the world best journalist she put her life on the line to tell the truth of a conflict that was just horrible she lost her life trying to express to the world what was happening in this small corner of hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"could be so much better","review":"My 19 month old is nuts about things that go, with diggers being his current fave.

After putting them through this device, they skipped even more. The directions say you must really buff them with the special buffing cloth. I don't know how much buffing people are willing to do but I'm a relatively strong guy and I buffed for about 10 minutes before being exhausted. Then I tried again and was just very dissapointed. Even worse, the spinning of the handle is quite time consuming and not very much fun. It would be very nice if the thing was mechanical and automatic. I have little patience for plastic toys.

I have a music CD, which I picked up in a forrest, that have many, many scraches, which caused three tracks on it to skip and repeat constantly. After a lot of spin cleaning, it erased all of scraches except the severe ones that caused the major skippings. those scars look like they have drawed around with a pin.The SpinDoctor got rid of all of the scars, except for the severe ones, and restored the quality and playability on my Sega Saturn CD games. It's quick, easy, and doesn't make a mess.

I was instantly displeased - this is a rather awkward, large product that has more than one part, and it's not terribly easy to use......or does it actually work. The wheel that carries the DVD doesn't actually spin anymore - it only worked a couple of times. The times it did work, the cleaning solution seems to have ruined the DVDs I used them on. I absolutely DO NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product, beware","review":"This product only worked on 1 CD not 50.

Extremely lightweight all-plastic construction insures a short useful life. I followed the instructions to the letter, and my CD still skips. The only positive aspect of the initial use is that one of the airweight plastic fittings broke, which means that I can throw it in the garbage where it belongs, since it's hardly worth the time and effort to return.

Despite meticulous cleaning and drying, the unit froze up because of a small amount of liquid seeping in around the blade...Poor design. With much work, hot soapy water and mineral oil for lubrication at seal, the unit worked, but leaked manufacturing oil and would always put oil into the blended liquid. The 2 speed switch is very cheaply made and started to malfunction. The stick blender needed to be scrapped. A much better-designed blender and worth looking into is the KitchenAid 3-Speed Immersion Blender #KHB2351. This has detachable parts for cleaning and has the drive motor and shaft always outside of and above the blended or chopped food.

However, if you need to whip more than a couple eggs for breakfast you may want to try something with a bit more power. Glad I purchased two because I burned out the first in about 10 minutes of use. Clean up is a breeze for simple eggs but working with a cake batter takes a bit more time as a thicker product hides in a lot more places.

The animation is great and the characters have tons of personality. Game play is pretty fun, I got a little drifty due to lack of challenge. The problem solving is not based on reality logic. You have to use logic according to what you have in your inventory. It's a very short game, I think I logged about 5-7 hours total and like I said, my attention was drifting frequently. Even though it wasn't a huge challenge, it's still a good game for the adventure players. I find games like Syberia way overrated and zero challenge except for the fact that I must finish it so Runaway IS worthwhile.

Still almost every week there's another horror story of an abused or neglected kid that fell through the cracks of the \\"system.\\"This is an absolutely amazing, and realistic account, of what long-term public interest litigation is like.

She masterfully weaves together the complex history and politics of child welfare reform efforts into a sophisticated account of the Wilder lawsuit and its impact on the system it was launched to alter. Lest the story of conflicting laws, bureaucratic incentive structures, powerbrokers, advocacy groups, administrations and child-serving agencies is not compelling enough, Bernstein's account of the litigation follows the travails of plaintiff, Shirley Wilder as she wanders through life and the system virtually unaffected by the lawsuit that bears her name. The Lost Children is a must-read for those concerned about reforming child-serving systems, seasoned veterans and newcomers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed.","review":"Important subject matter, but very biased treatment of the way the case was conducted.

This would be hilarious, if not for the fact that these were the same guys who once created such progressive rock masterpieces as Tarkus and Trilogy. Side one is totally forgettable, and though side two's Memoirs Of An Officer And A Gentleman suite has its moments, the material is too weak overall to sustain any musical or emotional momentum. It ends with a whimper - a \\"march\\" that comes off as a lame echo of Abbadon's Bolero (from Trilogy). Emerson ditched the Hammond organ in favor of the thin-sounding polyphonic synthesizer - a terrible mistake. What a sad, pathetic way to end a great artistic career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Keith hates this album","review":"We must remember that when Love Beach came out Keith Emerson wrote an open letter in \\"Keyboard\\" magazine apologizing for this album.

The first 5 albums are great but thereafter the two year break sapped the energy of the band as did the change in musical climate, after 1974 prog was totally out of fashion and never recovered. Canario is a nice classically inspired melody and Memoirs of .... etc is a stab at previous prog epics but falls way short, the rest is plain awful, sounds like it was made up on the spot, ELP had already scraped the barrel with Works Vol 2 this was far worse.ELP were great until 1974 then after a massive world tour, that was the time to split rather than persevere with dross like Works etc 1977-1979 was a waste of time apart from Fanfare...Buy the first 5 albums but avoid the later era like the plague"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remastering of a lousy album - what is the point?","review":"Maybe if they had released under some other band's name it might have been acceptable but for an ELP album, this is as bad as it gets.

Alas, all are marred by Emerson's work, which is at best hopelessly generic and at worst annoying as hell.

I had to go back and listen to Trilogy or Tarkus to still remain loyal to the group. If I ever place it on my still operable turntable to 'test it out' just one more time, just shoot me.

That's how bad it is. OK? Just to provide some perspective, it was recorded as a result of their label's pressure to put out another record, although their interest at the time was to take a few years off and pursue solo projects. The result was \\"a disjointed, uninspired collection of songs released in mid 1979\\" (quote from the band's official web site) and the break-up of ELP for 12 years.There's lots of great ELP material but this.

Or tossed back to Atlantic with the greeting: \\"We're done with you now, clean up YOUR mess.\\"It DOES sound as if they went back to their roots and played Beatley pop, ELP style - with a little RnB thrown in.

As a relative newcomer to the field of literary theory (by way of cultural studies), I found the book to be a lucid introduction to Bakhtin and his concepts of heteroglossia, dialogism, polyphony, carnival, and the chronotope. Lit-crit discourse is a challenge to grasp as first, especially if one's background is in the social sciences, as mine is. But if the reader brings some patience and a true interest in Bakhtin and his ideas, he or she will be rewarded. My objective was be able to understand Bakhtian references in the cultural studies pieces I read as a doctoral student in consumer behavior. I am happy to report that, not only was this objective achieved, but I was further spurred to go directly to the source and read Bakhtin myself. Sue Vice does a fine job explaining and applying these complex ideas. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Intro to Some Fascinating Ideas","review":"Sue Vice's book certainly achieves its stated goal of introducing the increasingly popular ideas of Mikhail Bakhtin to the general public. This books greatest aspect, perhaps, is that it manages separate out Bakhtin's major ideas from his many books. However, Vice's prose is sometimes a bit muddled and I occasionally found myself turning to the source material (Bakhtin) to clarify a point that she had made. Also, while no problem for me, someone not in the lit or philosophy field might have some trouble with the lit-crit terminology Vice throws at you.

Every chapter has numerous personal anectdoes about how the author had some kid that wasn't potty trained and then they used picures and miraculously they were potty trained in no time at all. Drink some Red Bull to stay awake. This theme repeated over and over and over. Plan B: Familiarize yourself with PECS (picutre exchange communication system) or I just printed out some clip art.

The book lost me after that.Los Angeles is pictured as a ditzy town where nothing important happens except for movies being made and people having plastic surgery.The plot is predictable and lacks originality. If you really want to read a \\"girl gets great job and it stinks\\" book, read the Lauren Weisberger ones - The Devil Wears Prada or Everyone Worth Knowing.

I'm a big fan of chick lit that dishes about the entertainment industry but the genre as a whole is becoming very stale. This book doesn't help bring in new fans. It was way too long and drawn out, the storyline was all over the place, and the pieces just didn't fit. You know how you're completing a jigsaw puzzle and you're down to the last few pieces and you try to make them fit? That's sorta what this book is like.I still give the book a generous 2.5 stars because I liked the subject matter, just not the way it was written overall.

Examples of topics include chords by seconds, all traditional tonal modes with several examples, mirror writing, added-note chords, multiple octave scales, clusters, 15th and 17th chords, etc. There are a lot of good examples taken from 20th century composers and some fun exercises at the end of each chapter to drive home the topics.

But it did capture them at their best and even now they put on an exciting live show; for the record, from the opening JERUSALEM they simply show off the highly talented musicians they are and don't let up. TOCCATA is brilliant and the extended AQUATARKUS never fails to reach those heights we all live for.

All I can say is that it is better than I remembered. My favorites have always been \\"Tarkus\\" and \\"Karn Evil 9.\\" They tried to include all their shorter \\"radio friendly\\" hits on this album as well.

But listening to it now, it's hard to take, and comes across as extraordinarily self-indulgent. Some of the songs (\\"Toccata,\\" for example) might be interesting today if covered by an industrial band, and others sound hilariously like Devo in their primitive synth noodlings.

[My COSTCO doesn't have them any longer] As I'd already tossed my receipt and the bulbs seemed to be working for me, I decided to keep them. One is actually still working more than 6 months later over my stairs where it's on about 5 hours a night.

Yes!","review":"I did a bunch of research into a multi-input video switch/splitter. There was nothing even remotely affordable except for this device by Startech. You can have, for example, a laptop and a desktop as sources, and four different outputs, such as 3 monitors and an LCD projector. Now, the switching ergonomics takes a minute to get used to, meaning it's not intuitively obvious how to get which input to a particular output.

It's sometimes a slog but is leavened by lots of amusing anecdotes about fads and celebrities, and the authors occasionally make catty comments about fellow writers of the period, a rich one in Brit lit. It was originally published in 1940 which, on the one hand, gives it a dated feel because the authors lack the decades of hindsight about events, particularly the outcome of WWII, that we enjoy today. Yet, the fact that it was a contemporary account also lends an immediacy to the writing.

And that after the female lays her eggs on shore, she returns to the sea?This is a great book to entertain and educate children.

I did wish it was a bit bigger only because I started getting a hand cramp toward the end of piping the cake! So it did take me a while to add the grass to the top of his 11x15 cake ( I think it was that big).

However, the electronics is unreliable, usually giving a drum beat roar as the volume switch is first advanced. Occasionally this malfunction can be bypassed so that the alarm appears to work, but it rapidly fails so that later it gives only a nearly inaudible bark.Finally, when the sound is operatiing, the quality of the speaker is extremely poor, so I doubt that most adults will be fooled -even when the unit is working.Allen Ansevin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"My house was recently broken into and I purchased this item, among others, as a security measure to help deter future theives.

There's no thick walls or steel structures that are interfering with it. In addition, it picks up anything that moves behind the unit inside the house (no matter what angle) which is annoying. I've tried making foil shields, etc. but can't get anything to work. It also gets 'stuck' and continues to bark after you've left the room and there's no motion.

My initial reactions are that it isn't really a game. It has no real decision making, and the winner is completely random. It has a few steps to figuring out who gets points, which can at first mask this fact. But it is indeed completely random.I could see this potentially be useful for really young children to learn the difference between right and left, and how to count. However, by the time they are old enough to safely handle dice, I would expect them to know these things beyond this products ability to teach them. Although, I am not a parent, and might be wrong about this.Otherwise, you're family game time would be better spent playing something that fires some neurons.

If you had any doubts that country music was hugely influenced by African American blues, this box set will assure you that despite societal segregation, cross pollination between musicians was rampant. Fans of steel guitar will find some gems in this compilation. Roy Smeck and King Benny Nawahi make appearances as well as lesser known players like Lemuel Turner. The early 20th century Hawaiian music craze obviously made its impact on old time string band players as well as the early blues slide guitarists. And wait until you hear Gene Autrey belting the blues! But historical interest aside, these four discs are filled with wonderful songs and instrumental and vocal performances.

NEVER BUY A PRODUCT FROM PTG RECORDS EVER!! The CD is from a vinyl record and not the original tapes! You can't play it too loud or you will hear distortion from the vinyl limit. This CD sounds worse than the old CD's reissued in the 80s. A standard CD you are supposed to hear the tape hiss when the song first comes on and when the song fades out. Some of the tracks you don't hear the tape and fades out too quickly to the next track. Pass on this buy.

Too many side trips, everything gets solved in the last 10 pages, with enough cliff hangers to let you know there's another one coming. Pilar disappears as a character half way through-although she is one of the main parts to the story. EVERY other character we've ever met seems to play a bit part, Janet, Ransom, etc etc but they are not part of the story line. Not enough detail in the ending, and lots left unsaid.

It is amazing the way Randy Wayne White can pull you in to his books, so that you just can't put in down."},{"rating":"1","title":"a cautionary tale","review":"I read this book soon after I started seeing Dr Hedaya for depression. There are some useful nuggets in the book about the benefits of good nutrition, regular exercise, and meditation. However, after following Hedaya's treatment plan to the letter for almost two years - including a regime of up to 30 supplements a day and various diets - and spending over $40,000 on appointments - he charges $400 per 50-minute appointment - and expensive lab tests, I got no results. His so-called integrative holistic approach ('whole psychiatry'), which is supposed to reduce a patient's dependence on medications, had me increasing the number of medications I was on, including an anti-convulsant. His claim to be able to restore a patient's vital biological factors and hormonal balance through nutritional supplements and special diets has not been supported by the available scientific evidence. If you do read the book, I recommend getting a second opinion before acting on its recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Familiar stuff.

Moreover, there's a certain arrogance about the author's prescriptions. For example, one of his dietary menus calls for \\"13 grapes.\\" Heaven help you if it's 12 or 14. If the program doesn't work, don't blame it on Dr. Hedaya. For good measure, the author overwhelms you with advice--from weight-lifting to forming a compatible relationship with your therapist to testing for hypo-thyroidism to hormone replacement measures.In sum, this is not a book likely to help anyone who is suffering from depression nor is it a book providing useful information about antidepressant side-effects (\\"serotonin-syndrome,\\" for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre/Dubious","review":"One glaring omission is that he fails to mention that SSRIs can cause permanent sexual side effects even after discontinuance.

We need to recognize these influences first and then work through how they impact us.It also helped me see the huge responsibility I will have as a parent and how my love towards my husband is viewed by my children and how it can affect the way my children view God.It really helped put things into perspective.

Although Miller speaks from his experiences of having a father that abandoned him, the book spoke to me as my father passed away when I was young. The chapter on the right equipment was very powerful for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good overall","review":"Having grown up without a father also, it was very easy for me to relate to Miller's account. While of course some of his personal journey differs from my own, I found myself empathizing quite a bit with him. While this book is not a self-help book, I think it a good read for men who grew up without fathers, to uncover some buried issues. I also think that it would be a good read for men with fathers, and even women, in order that they might gain insight into the world of fatherless men. I would definitely encourage any/everyone to support The Mentoring Project.BTW - the book has a very cool textured cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Needed Perspective","review":"Donald Miller's latest project will unfortunately hit home for a great number of people. Miller's writing isn't unfortunate, it's actually direct, poignant, and much needed. The unfortunate part is that there are countless people in our world who have either grown up without a father, or are in the process of braving their childhood alone. Miller opens his life for the reader and traces the uncertainty and anger that mark the life of many who have no father to anchor their lives. Miller's words are encouraging and never preachy. \\"To Own a Dragon\\" is a not only a great read for those working through issues relating to their fathers, but for those aspiring to be influential father themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting history book","review":"This is a very good history book. There are lots of maps and pictures of actual places/artifacts. At the beginning of each section there is a timeline that helps keep track of what period in time you are studying.This text encourages students to keep a 'history journal' about the place/time they are studying as if they are actually there. It contains a reference Atlas, a handbook section reviewing study and writing skills, and not just an English glossary, but also a Spanish glossary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Translation!","review":"This is a very, very loose reconstruction of the text, based on Koch's own theories about the Celtic proto-language that Old Welsh dveloped from. This 'proto-language' is itself little more than a theory and therefore the validity of the work is dubious. Most of the \\"evidence\\" presented here has been disproved by Graham R.

Although a fair attempt at the impossible, this book is at best misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Spart Tester","review":"I do like this spark tester because it's easy to see if you have proper spark when you are alone. I'm old school and testing spark is easy. normally just remove the spark plug and make sure you have a gap to a goood ground and you can see it, and even have done it where you hold it and take the small jolt yourself. Really when you are alone and it's a recoil start engine someone else has to pull the rope for lawnmowers, snow blowers etc. Cars well same thing someone else has to turn the ignition switch, not that I havent' just crossed a screwdriver across the solenoid on cars and boats that actually have an external solenoid. I have had other gap style testers too but I can now see spark easily alone. I work on lots of different stuff and it's nice to have a visual diagnostic tool so I would suggest this item to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine","review":"Works fine. Well made, especially for the low price. Would like to see better indication of the spark condition. The bulb in the tool simply flashes an orange light each time the spark plug fires. Would be nice if the tool actually flashed the color of the spark to give you an indication of spark condition (i.e. blue for good spark, orange for weak spark) as is determined when using an actual spark plug and grounding to the engine while cranking. Instead, the instructions state that the bulb will flash dimly if the ignition spark is weak. Good enough I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described","review":"To get this tool to work you turn off your engine and then attached one rubber end to the spark plug and the other end to the spark plug wire. Then, start the engine. The light shines fairly bright and the light pulses. So, if the spark plug is not firing as good as the other plugs, the light will not pulse as frequently or as bright."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Featured in Cycleworld.

It did not work too well for me as my spark plug was fairly deep in the spark plug well. I had a hard time plugging the end into the spark plug, having to carefully fish it down to seat/mate it properly with the spark plug.Also when removing the tester from the spark plug, I had to pull on the wire as I could not access the boot from down in the tube. I don't know how this will affect the longevity of the connections but I assume pulling on the wire won't make it last too long.If you have a short spark plug tube, this will work well for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs more of the NWA!!!","review":"I bought this tape yesterday and overall I am pleased with it, though i was a little disappointed by the total lack of matches from Mid-Atlantic, save the tag match with Steamboat and Younblood and a World Title match with Flair from '84.I have to wonder if the matches from this era are in bad shape or something because they really should have been inlcuded here!Steamboat is truly an all-time legend and this DVD comes close to doing him justice, but not quite.

There are so many legends and top superstars talking about how great Ricky was and how he influenced their careers, but it's the amount of interview clips given from the man himself that make this documentary more interesting since your hearing about the stories directly from him with add ons by other superstars. Though only just over an hour long, it does move along at a quick pace with plenty of highlight clips from his career thrown in, to get that WWE documentary feel that they do so well. I enjoyed watching this video and while Ricky Steamboat may not have been the biggest superstar he might have been, he is still a legend.

It is a record primarily, I believe, of his \\"sermons\\" in America and he brings the material to life.

Therefore, if you are buying this product for the benefits of white oak bark, you would be better off buying it and using it than this green looking powder.Because this product stains the teeth, I tried the IPSAB powder. IPSAB cleans the teeth extremely well, but the salt content was so high that I decided I would rather not have high blood pressure. I now use a powder made by NARA. It has salt, but is not salty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saitek J64 P3000 Wireless Pad","review":"I have had the pad for 3 months and am disappointed with not only the pad but also the lack of customer service that Saitek provides. The indicator light, on the base always shows that it is charging, the pads battery strength is either all, or the pad goes dead. The strength indicator is fake or does not work. Also the pad looses communication with the base at, what seems to be the worst possible time. Even when I have the base with in a clear 4 inches of the unit they loose communication on a regular basis. I contacted customer support at Saitek over a month ago and never received ANY reply to my email. I do not recommend buying this and furthermore recommend Logitec products. I have one of their force feedback joysticks and am happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Issues","review":"As all of the other posters state this controller has a serious issue with its batteries. I, too, contacted the company and without any question they sent two replacement... no qualms with that kind of service, but the new batteries died just as quickly. I even tried removing the back cover (which was successful) revealing 2 NiMH 1.2V 280mAh batteries. However, the were both seated in the casing properly. I may try and replace them, however the bottom line is that I shouldn't have to go through all of this hassle. My recommendation is to buy a wireless PC gamepad that works the first time... am I not wise? :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Saitek P3000 Wireless Game Pad","review":"In the box this thing comes with your standard paperwork, a CD with the drivers, the usb \\"docking station\\" that charges the batteries and receives the rf signal, the controller and two rechargeable batteries. Out of the box one of these batteries didn't work at all. Plugging it into the charger would not turn on the charging light and plugging it into the controlled would not power it. The other battery seemed to work fine and for a time (about 4 days) this controller did its job very well. After a couple of charges, however, the second battery went the way of the first.I have called their tech support and they should be sending me new batteries shortly. Assuming that this solves my problem I have no other complaints about this controller. It plays my emulated console games rather well will full analog functionality (when it had power that is).

Great, they worked! Then they died soon after. Hopefully their new wireless, which runs on one AA battery will not have any issues. However, this one's a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery problems, poor performance","review":"1 of the 2 rechargable batteries it came with didn't work right out of the box. After over a month, the second battery started having problems; for example, I'd have to keep on re-inserting it into the gamepad or the recharger before it recognized it was in.I contacted customer support about the problem. They said my batteries were defective and that they would mail me new ones. I never received it, and this was months ago.There are other problems too. The calibration of the analog sticks gets messed up during gameplay occassionally. Sometimes, the buttons aren't responsive; you press a button and it either doesn't register or registers late. Lastly, the rubber on the analog sticks wear out badly after a year (I don't even use it that much b\\\\c of the battery problems).The feel of the gamepad alone is good though. The buttons are in comfortable places, and there are enough of them to be able to setup most games.

She drinks Predator blood. She telepathically knows where Pred is hiding. Dredd goes there and kills him. THAT'S IT!It's way too short for it's own good. There is no pathos. Slight humor.

So, I'm not surprised to see no mention here about how the top 1% of earners pay more than a third of all income taxes, or that the top half pay almost 95%, but you CAN find that data on the IRS's own website.

This book pulls back the curtain and shows why the debate over whether the top marginal rate should be X or Y percent is irrelevant to anyone truly rich.Some of the chapters I found most interesting were on how CEOs have enough flexibility to defer their income almost indefinitely to avoid paying taxes on anything they aren't ready to spend, and on how the IRS enforcement budget is mis-allocated - they have plenty of funding to audit the poor, but real-estate partnership returns aren't even matched up with individual income tax returns to make sure they're consistent.

I was so astounded by some of the claims here that I just had to verify them on the internet and other sources.

His time of Banishment is ending and his old enemy has sent the Great Hunt to track him down. He is rescued by a Warden sent to watch over him. Unfortunately, she is given the unhappy task of convincing him of his identity and bringing him back to the Faerie Lands.The beginning of the book lacks much of the atmosphere and character building that makes the best novels work.

As an open-heart surgery survivor and thriver (summer 2003), in my opinion the book is a dismal account of one man's unique experience exacerbated by depressive illness that he was battling at least a year before his surgery. My concern is that his account is so negative as to dissuade a heart patient from chosing bypass surgery when indicated. That would be regrettable. Having talked to numerous open-heart surgery patients, clearly the majority of us benefit enormously from the miracle of open-heart operations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I have to agree with the other's opinions that this is a totally misleading guide to OHS. The author continued suffering from an already diagnosed depression not necesarily exacerbated by his surgery. This should in no way be read by someone facing OHS. Just the author's account of his excruciating pain is enough to scare someone away from needed treatment. Don't know where he had his surgery, but this just is not the way it really is. Seemed like he had a grudge toward his former employer, and carried this theme throughout his book for not diagnosing him sooner."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR WOMEN!!!!!!","review":"I am a woman, and 1 year ago had triple By-Pass Open Heart Surgery....this book was definitely not targeted towards women....such a difference!!!!!!

They become lovers much to the chagrin of Claire, Quinn's pregnant wife. Dull Claire become a plotting and tenacious partner, determined to get Quinn back.

I was not disappointed. The beginning of the book is a little slow - it does fill you in on histories and such, but it's almost tempting to put down because it's not the best opening. Keep reading, and it'll suck you in. It truly was written beautifully. A quick read - barely 200 pages - but you'll be thinking about it afterwards, wondering what all happens next. My only complaint (besides the slow beginning, that is) is that I wish we could have seen what happens next, after the book ends. I wondered what happened between all the different friendships and such. Overall, very good, very sensual.

Sometimes for larger cup sizes extra support is added. I really thought that would be the case when she received it because, in my opinion, this photo is misleading.

And doesn't work well, either.","review":"This thing weighs a ton and is NOT easy to carry up and down stairs even though it has a carry handle built into it.If it didn't have a self-propel feature, you wouldn't be able to push it!And it is very messy to empty the dirt cup. What's the point of all that hepa filtration if a cloud of dust escapes from the cup when emptying it?I was having mechanical problems with it after 3 years, so I bought a new vacuum recently, and found out that my new Bissell sucks up TONS more dirt than this one ever did. It made me realize that a heavier \\"smarter\\" vaccuum didn't mean it could do a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed - DONT BUY","review":"We had a Hoover that died on us after 10 years. Since our old vacuum worked so well we bought this vacuum over two years ago. The first few months it worked very well but it fell apart in the first year. The power button doesn't work (won't shut off), the self propel button doesn't work, and the brushes won't spin on our new shag carpet. We are constantly repairing it. Don't buy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Vacuum For The Money","review":"This vacuum does an excellent job of getting a rug clean. It has a very strong suction power which makes vacuuming things like area rugs even with the attachment tools a challenge. One needs to have both feet on the area rug or another other type of small rugs to hold them down so that they don't actually get sucked into the vacuum! There are some design flaws in this vacuum. The hose is located in the back. Anytime it is used with the attachments, the vacuum has a tendency to tip over. The carrying handle is also in the back behind the hose and the cord, making it difficult to use. This vacuum is difficult to handle on the stair because it is big and heavy. There is a special tool to use on the stairs, which works very well, but the extra long hose (not included - extra purchase) is needed, if this vacuum is used on the stairs. The extra long cord is nice. We have two dogs and two kids and this vacuum does an excellent job of cleaning up after them."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad purchase","review":"14 months young and broken. beater brush doesn't work, trouble with the on/off switch....just like all the other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"This vacuum broke within several months after I bought it this spring--the on switch would not turn off. The manager of the store where I bought it said they had returned this model, as well. I will not buy Hoover vacuums again. This is the third Hoover vacuum cleaner that has been poorly made that I've bought in the past five years. One (a canister Hoover) had an attachment with a plastic connector that broke every six months, and I ordered replacement nozzles by the batch. Another was so loud we could not live with it and returned it. This one was heavy and did not even last five months. I think quality control at Hoover must not be what it used to be. I've switched to a Miele canister, which is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged my hard wood floors","review":"I don't see that anybody else complained about this, but I think it's worth mentioning. I used it on my hard wood floors, on the correct setting... and it immediately chomped out two big chunks of hard wood flooring!! I basically screamed and picked it up as fast as I could. It was too late. I checked everything on it, and it seemed fine. It continued to work great on carpet, but I wasn't dumb enough to try it on the hardwood floors again. Maybe it was a random defect, but if you have nice hardwood floors, or like them without chunks missing I wouldn't take my chances with this one. The hand tool is a great idea, but hair and gunk gets wrapped around the spinners and it stops working. I tried cleaning it out, but it didn't seem to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windtunnel","review":"When the machine is working, it actually cleans very well. This is my 4th one in seven years. YES 4th one. Works great when first new, after that it is all DOWN hill from there. I should have bought stock in Hoover just to pay for them and all the repairs. I did a comparison with my sisters-in-laws (3) of them. 1 was a Kirby other was a elcrolux (sp) and the third was a Dyson. My one sil's Dyson has been hers for the past 5 years. She has no problems with it. I went with the Dyson DC18 and it does a FANTASTIC job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've had this vacuum for over a year.

Does okay on carpet. The attachments are all convenient and easy to use.If you are buying to use on hard surfaces, I'd get something different. It won't even pick up a staple or grain of rice off the wood floor -- just not enough suction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed after a year","review":"I have owned this vacuum a little over a year. Initially, the vacuum cleaner was great. I purchased it after reading consumer reviews. However, after two weeks, the plastic switch that changes the vacuum from carpet to bare floor broke--this was fixed for free at the vacuum cleaner shop where I purchased the item. Now that I am no longer under warranty, the on/off switch does not work and neither does the self-propelled switch. An employee at the vacuum cleaner shop says that happens frequently because the switches are plasitc and it's between 40 and 50 dollars to get it fixed. I asked why the Hoover Wind Tunnel is rated so high and he said it's because the motor is good. Needless to say, I am looking to purchase a different brand of vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say LOUD?","review":"After owning a Kirby for years but getting tired of how heavy it was dragging it up and downstairs we decided to try something lighter. This vacuum does clean well but holy cow it is loud. It's so loud it scares our dogs, birds, cat and my kids! It doesn't seem to matter if it's on carpeting or a wood floor. It's just loud and obnoxious. I just hate using it and won't buy another Hoover again. Get some ear plugs if you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cleaner","review":"Picks up dog hair very well, the hand power tool works well on throw rugs as there is too much suction when using the vacuum itself. The only problem is the short extension hose, it really should come with another longer extension hose. We really do like the lighter weight of this one as apposed to to the heavy older Hoover we had. Love the self-propelled feature. Like the way it fits under furniture and like the on board tools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jesus H.Christ","review":"It is a damn good thing that I cannot get this authors e mail address The ONLY thing this book is good for is aggravating my shoulder injury as I throw it out of my library in a fit of total RAGE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly real","review":"If you have seen Wiktor Grodecki's 2 documentories on the rent boys of Prague \\"Not Angels But Angels\\" and \\"Body Without Soul\\" you will see many of their stories merged together in this riviting drama of one boys life on the mean streets and what he has to do to survive.

Powerful and sad, but has moved this viewer to re-examine my beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Bleak","review":"As indignity upon indignity is heaped on our protagonist, one gets a distinct whiff of self-loathing if not actual homophobia in this depiction of a young gay man's exploitation in the big city. Mandragora is way too long, relentlessly bleak and only has a couple of novel cinematic tricks to spark a bit of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment ...","review":"The film was badly made and poorly acted. The story, while sad, was completely irrealistic, the depiction of the characters superficial and far from any reality as well, the dialogues trivial if not stupid. This is not a film I can recommend to an educated audience which is used to a certain intellectual standard. It's - to use one \\"mean\\" word - East Bloc.What made things worse is that I could at no moment relate to the main character: He is not a poor little boy who is drawn into the hustler/porn scene by circumstances. He is a stubborn youngster who runs away from a loving home and from school, who actively looks for the hustler scene, but who is not intelligent enough to survive- first he has the old pimp (whatever his name is, Monza or something like that) take advantage of him, then another hustler.The film bores you, it is not drastic or realistic or strong at all (like I hoped it would be). Honestly, I watched the last hour or so in fast forward mode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. Since I purchased the movie, I felt that I had to watch it but it was painful to do so. I fast forwarded much of it because it was so bad and unbelievable.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops..Ankit Fadia did it again!","review":"I am going to throw my two cents in! I agree with Ashely M (From Australia) that the initial three reviews are written by Ankit Fadia. They all have written only one review so far in Amazon.com and gave 5 stars.I have read Fadia's book before, and being an IT analyst, I can tell you that whatever he writes is crap and does not have any practical knowledge. It's very easy to write a book like that, because all you have to do is spend couple of months on Google, copy information from website, and paste it on your Word processor, edit it, and give it to publisher. However, the only hard work Fadia's does is choosing a good title for a book.This book is as bad as his earlier book. Don't buy and waste your $50 on this crap, instead donate it to Greenpeace or CRY.As said by one of the reviewers, I have to give one star as that is the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overrated","review":"I'm not sure what's up with all the great previous reviews. My guess is the writers of those reviews aren't extremely knowledgable in network security.This book is riddled with inaccuracies, ranging from completely and absolutely wrong statements to misleading information. I never got through more than 5 pages without finding another instance of misleading or incorrect information.The author's age - 17 years old - most definitely shows. He comes off as more of a \\"script kiddie\\" than anything. He obviously doesn't have the in-depth security, networking, and systems knowledge that a true security expert with a number of years of real world experience would have.On the positive side, it does have some good information, but not valuable nor significant enough to make up for the amount of bad info.I'd look elsewhere - this is definitely not a book I'd recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"HIGHLY INCOMPETENT","review":"My friend showed me this book in the Teksons bookstore, it was so bad i wouldnt have bought it for free.

Thousands of Senior Women readers e-mailed it to friends (that is how I was introduced to it) and one sent it to the late Ann Landers without attribution. Landers was so taken with it she published it in her column (she quickly acknowledged that Mula was the author as soon she learned of it). \\"Stranger\\" is but one of over 40 short pieces of Mula's wry, self-deprecating (but no less wise) slant on even the most ordinary events. Although the one about her father, who looked just like Pope John Paul II and was co-winner of a look-alike contest in vestments that included a yarmulke borrowed from a Jewish neighbor, is hardly ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Close Call for Bostom Blackie","review":"Really Enjoyed this old classic mystery.

I've collected 6 espisodes of this series and so far this is the least insteresting of them. Though the history of the Boston Blackie charactor goes back a while, the film series follows the far more successful Thin Man series in production, without that series wonderful witty writting, acting or production. Boston Blackie is produced on a shoestring and the writting is very low grade and simple. The cookie cutter police charactors of Farraday and his dim witted side kick would make you wonder if they could solve any case beyond jay walking. If you want clever, intelligent mystery/detective writting, watch the Thin Man, Miss Marple or Philo Vance series, leave Boston Blackie on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"It started off good...","review":"... but then it all went downhill..

I've made a couple of the recipes and the worst one ever was the cornbread recipe. If you want a really good low carb cookbook...check out George Stella's cookbooks, especially his newer one or even Dana Carpender's cookbooks.

(This is not the seller's fault - the manufacturer's packaging claims that it will fit the 40GB)2) The claim \\"Comes with 3 iPod jackets, each with a lanyard\\" is factually incorrect. There is only 1 lanyard included for the 3 skins - this is clearly visible from the unopened package, so I lay the blame on the seller (who presumably wrote the copy for the Amazon page)They are a good value at the current price of $.99 - however they are not as described - thus my 2 star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"It sneaks up on you","review":"This book sneaks up on you.

I cannot believe how poorly engineered this toy is. The images displayed by the projector are utterly unwatchable. The 3-D effect makes it so you can never have more than about 20% of the image in focus at one time; you can see a portion of the image, but the rest is very blurry. Adjust the focus, a different part of the image comes into focus, but the rest is blurry. My kids (six and three) couldn't even discern what was happening in the pictures. The strength of the bulb is disappointing as well. Using brand new alkaline batteries, the projector wasn't strong enough to brightly project the images more than about 2-3 feet, and that distance the images are only about 10-12 inches wide (not exactly the \\"movie theater\\" experience I was hoping for).

They are not strong enough to hold up books. I'm using them to hold up about 1 1/2 feet long worth of children's books in my daughter's nursery, and as soon as I let go the little cherubs slide right off the dresser.Over all, very dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little D.J.'s","review":"We bought this for our 10 mth. old for Xmas (our 4 yr old loves it too). The first thing I noticed when our 10 mth. old was playing with it was that if you put just a little pressure on the top the dial will stick badly. It's not so bad the first couple of times, but after awhile they think it's a game. Don't get me wrong I think this is a fantastic toy. I just think Fisher-price should have put a plastic shield on top of the dial to keep it for getting pushed down like that. Anyone else have this problem?

I go to play group where all the moms own this. There are about 6 of us. All agree that 6 months was a little young for this. Now the babies who are 1 and those about to be are starting to love it.I am sure some 6 month olds were fine with it but the only thing the kids really got into till now was the spinning thing on the top. The rest they barely knew was there and even when they did some of the levers were a little difficult for them to work and they were just to \\"young\\" to work it.My little one is just that petite and some of it she just didn't have the strength for.THAT BEING SAID..

His Aunt and Uncle (10 & 11) and the grownups love to play with it with him. He is now 10.5 mos. and loves it even more as he is able to better manipulate the blocks into the maze and the release chute.

Even though sometimes that doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be more interesting for 1-year old!","review":"This toy is boring and not well assembled! I purchased this $50 toy because I thought it would be educational for our daughter - sticking blocks in holes, and a variety of other fun things to do with blocks! Not so. The \\"special block\\" on the top only announces its name as you press the button, and the revolving spinny thing (on our model) is grinding, after only 7 days of play. The side that you drop the blocks into (the storage container looking thing) keeps opening, so not all the blocks actually stay in, and I agree with a previous reviewer....you can only drop 6-8 blocks into the \\"lever\\" side before they all dump out. Not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY","review":"I am extremely disappointed in this toy for my son. We got it for him when he was turning 9 months old, and he seemed to love it. The major problem is that he only loved it when it WORKED and that was only about 2 weeks. There is no way this toy is worth its $50 price tag. It obviously needs some quality adjustments, for instance, my son loves to stop the top from spinning around...thus most children will break this feature. If it had some kind of covering, it may be a bit more durable. My son is now 11 months old, and likes opening and closing the door (to put blocks in), and using the toy to pull himself up, but it does not hold his interest. He keeps hitting the blue button to make it play music (but it doesn't anymore). I think this toy had the potential to be really great, but it is just not worth the money when it breaks after 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a boring toy","review":"We bought this for our Daughter and the most she has ever played with it is 2 minutes at a time.The top is not really interactive and only spins,when you take a block and put it in the middle it should say what the block is but you need adult muscles to do that and the sides dont hold very many blocks before they all drop. For the price I would not buy this toy, there are so many other cheaper and more interesting ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I found this toy on the manufacturer's website and played with the demo that they had. It seemed really fun so I purchased it for my daughter. After receiving the item I was incredibly disappointed. There is no educational value for this toy. My baby can't learn anything from this toy. There are 8 blocks that activate the toy's music and that is it. The sides to drop the toys down is really boring. This toy never captured my daughter's interest.

Also the motor on it is louder that the music.-It is not age appropriate for a 6 month old.-The blocks spilling into the cube is very loud.Overall I think I would have been better off getting the Laugh and learn House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but doesn't work well","review":"I bought this for my 20 month old.

I should have followed my rules. The spin thing was grinding on the first day and the blocks sometimes fall through the slotted side without the lever being pulled. My 3 yr old has more fun with it then my 11 month old as she can pretty much figure out how things work. But even she moves on to something else after a few minutes. My 11 month old finds pulling things out of our recycling bin more entertaining. The plastic that this is made out of also seems faulty. If your child slammed it with a heavy toy it could easily crack. Even if this toy worked as it was supposed to I would still think it is definitely overpriced. I am hoping that with time my 11 month old will play with it more.Now the LeapFrog Fridge Farm Magnetic Animal Set is great and less than half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the new vtech alphabet activity cube instead!","review":"The vtech alphabet activity block is like the incrediblock but better, just as educational if not more, cheaper ($40), and don't have the expensive replacement blocks! The spinning wheel on top of the incrediblock seems really stupid bc when kids rest their elbow on it (it's on the top of the block remember??), it almost ruins the toy. Only 8 peekablocks \\"speak\\" whereas on the vtech toy, if you put the alphabet blocks in, it says each of the 26 letters! Like the incrediblock, the vtech toy also has a storage area for the blocks -- the replacement peekablocks are ridiculously expensive! Also, the batteries on the incrediblock drain VERY quickly!

The blocks fall out of the stackeron their own, or won't fall out when you push the button. The orange door on the sorter will not stay shut. The stickers that are already on, were'nt on well, and the ones you put on, well you'd better get them on right the first time or they will not come off to fix. I hope they come out will a better model for less money because until then, I don't want one.

She is now 18 months old and has never taken to it. I have tried to get her to play with it several times but she just doesnt like it. It seems like it would be a fun toy but I guess it depends on the kid. The four sides of play arent really that exciting and when the child puts the block on the top to hear what it says the turntable spins. However the top is where most kids are going to hold onto so the tuntable just gets stuck and makes a horrible noise. I dont think its really worth the money.

She is not old enough to use it as intended, but she loves for us to hold her while she stands and presses the blue button to turn on the music. We have showed her what it does and she likes to knock the blocks out of the plug n' play side. I think that when she is a little older it will be good for her hand eye coordination to place the blocks in the holes. Some have complained that the motor is too loud, but we don't have that problem with ours. There is only one speaker for the music, so when you play on the side with the speaker the music will be louder than the other sides. Also, we have not had a loud grinding noise when she tries to stop the spinning on the top. They may have made a change to the new ones, we just bought it this week, but we have not had any problems. So far it has been a great toy and I am sure my daughter will get a lot of enjoyment out of it(my husband & I do!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy-even for older tots.","review":"We got this for our 3 month old for Christmas (I know he's a little too young, but his birthday isn't until Sept.)

She puts little toys on the spinning center part and lets them go 'round and 'round, and she loves to show her brother how it works! (Great family toy when you have multiple younger children!!) It's a little noisey when the blocks fall into their various spots- which is okay unless it's during nap time!! :) I got it (on sale) at the local store ($35) because it was in a baby magazine as one of the top toys for keeping baby's attention. I would say it passes as that (at least for my 3 yr old- even my 3-month takes interest). Overall, I think it promotes creativity and intellectual, physical and even social growth.

She's had it since aobut 6 months and just turned one. She doesn't play with it as often as she use to. However, when we first purchased it she used it to practice standing up. You should brace the cube however. She loved the spinning top and the music. She also loved the sorting bin, and the stacking columns where she could press the lever and make them all fall.My only gripe is the other two sides. The side with the mirror lost my daughter's interest. She really never was interested in it. The side with the falling down pegs seems pretty cool, but it is very difficult to remove the blocks once they're at the bottom. You have to maneuver them to the center then pull out.Other than that she has really enjoyed it and I believe we got our money's worth.

They seemed to learn to sort & stack pretty quickly after recieving this, have been learning new skills every couple of weeks- all with the help of this one big toy. Yes, it's big, but it also means you don't have to buy 4 toys that do what this ONE will. So sturdy- I will have one baby leaning on this on either side & it won't budge (I'm sure it's capable of slipping, but hasn't happenned yet).

It only comes with 8 blocks and those are the only blocks that work with it. All other blocks just play music and you can't buy additional blocks anywhere. In my opinion, the toy is a big waste of space and money. For $50 you can buy a lot of other toys that are a lot more fun and cheaper.

He hasn't gotten around to all of the sides, because they're a little too old for him, but he's quite taken with the trap door on one side. But I'm postive that this product will grow with him once he learns to associate whats inside the blocks with the noises they make when you put them on top.

One side to drop the blocks in and watch them bounce down (very loudly.) One side to put them in and push and button to watch them fall out (again very loudly.)

She likes to put the blocks inside the Incrediblock and also enjoys watching them fall down the side. The one downfall of this toy is that it's expensive!

Jerry Hadley was blessed with a rich lyric tenor, expressiveness which came from the heart, and more musicality in his little finger than most of us will have in a lifetime. His German has always been impeccable, and he has a gift for conveying all the 'schlag' (meant 100% as a compliment) that a Viennese operetta aria can hold... and then some.Some folks may think that Jerry Hadley is too expressive, but that's an oxymoron in the world of singing. Expressiveness and emotion are the reasons the music and lyrics were written in the first place.He was in his element in these beautiful arias. As a fan, I will sorely miss hearing his voice in any future live or newly-recorded performances, since the world lost him today, July 18, 2007.

And, though slightly less adorable and slightly less handsome, the characters who surround him as just as adroitly realized.However, as wonderful as the film's first 80 minutes are, the story's unfortunate \\"walk into the sunset\\" denouement ties up all the loose fray in a rather cheesy package.Still, putting that aside, when the script is all said and done, it is mostly Taillefer who makes this carefully subtitled French flick worthwhile and memorable, despite some faults at the conclusion.It definitely belongs in your collection of gay male cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"very encouraging","review":"i appreciated this book so much for being so humble, open and honest and i'm grateful for the fact that a christian recording artist and his wife would open up about this topic which has shamed so many into silence. the enemy has run rampant in this area and men and women need to see examples of how the Lord is able to work and redeem someone out of the bondage of sexual sin, that He is so willing and able to restore all that has been stolen from a christian marriage that's been torn apart...it reinforces the hope i have in the Lord for my marriage and was very encouraging..."},{"rating":"2","title":"very sincere and humble","review":"i d like to thank the crosse family not only for sharing about the sin that is often taking too lightely, but mainly they shared about the difference of the shallow and lukewarm christian life and their deep conversion. i live in the czech republic and there is a very low percentage of christians down here. we need testimonies like clay s and renee s to avoid same mistakes and compromises. i recommend the book. it s easy to read and captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I was able to get this book for free which was a special bonus, of course!

A bit more generic info here on building a 327, 700R4, etc. But, some specifics too, like engine swaps.4) Body...

Unlike the Basic Doodle Pro, or even the Original Magna Doodle where the pen is on the right(although Magna Doodle does have a long string).

We thought the Little People edition was extra cute, especially the soccer ball eraser. However my first complaint is that the pen tip only works when you aim straight down, which little kids don't know how to do. Second, it takes like four swipes to make the board look completely erased and third, both the stamps and pen look faded when drawing compared to other Doodle sets I've tried (in other words, the marks look darker on other models). One more thing that's annoying is the Little People guy comes too far into the drawing space. While this item is cute, we're returning ours and going with a basic model which appears to be a better option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad to see - not easy for a toddler to use","review":"I had previously purchased the standard blue Doodle Pro for my 3 year old, and he loved it - a great toy. So when my 1 1/2 year old twins started showing an interest in drawing, I purchased one of these Little People boards for each of them. Much to my disappointment, the tip on the end of the pen was so short that its impossible to draw unless the pen is straight up and down. The soccer ball slide eraser is so tight that they can hardly move it. The only good thing is the magnets are nice and big and easy to use. I have to say that all in all, this is taking the product downhill - stick with the standard Doodle Pro, you'll be much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"pen doesn't work","review":"The concept is adorable for those young little people fans. I love the shape stampers & they come out very easily for little fingers. My 20 month old daughter can erase the picture herself with the soccer ball eraser. The problem for myself, my 20-month-old & my 6 year-old who also tested this toy is that the pen is made in a way that if you turn the pen at an angle to draw or write (the normal way anyone would hold a pen or pencil) it won't write. It has a short magnetic tip on the end combined with blunt plastic around it instead of the angled pen of the magna doodle. I returned the first one & purchased a second one thinking maybe the first was simply defective & they are both the same. I also compared it with other models & it is just made weird. Bottom line..stampers are great but rather frustrating to draw with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for my toddler!!!","review":"My daughter received this for Christmas, and she was 19 months old. She LOVES it!!! She will play with it for hours. I didn't have the problems the other people have with the pen. She can use it just fine. My husband and I can both write with it just fine.

I'm not sure about Makiriko, but Battler Sienne Matra is worth watching - even if it does look like it was made in somebody's garage and back yard. Very low budget, Z-movie films, few people involved, and heads up, the language is in Japanese with English subtitles. The first film would likely be rated PG, the second film would be rated R.
