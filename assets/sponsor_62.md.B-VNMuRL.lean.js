On this record here they do a bunch of Bob Wills type Western swing. but it's pretty durn awesome.

Nicholson and Bruce Dern are great, and it seems that most of the dialogue must have been adlibbed. No one can write this badly. All the sterotypes are here and if you can hold your lunch down, or keep from hyperventilating from laughter, you will have a great time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Cycle Savages and Angels Wild Women","review":"I didn't think I'd find a worse biker movie (and I like the genre a lot) than Cycle Savages but this is it. I agree with whoever said the dialogue must be ad libbed. Bruce Dern, Jack Nicholson, Cameron Mitchell and Diane Ladd, and this is the best they can come up with. Mitchell's pathetic attempt at getting help from the people of a one dog town instead of smacking the crap out of the wimp deputy and taking is gun is sickening enough, but this is the lamest excuse for a bike gang I've ever seen. Never thought I'd see a movie that made Cycle Savages look good, but this is it. The one thing this movie has is a couple of real nice looking bikes (which is what I watch motorcycle movies for), the customized Triumph that Dern rides an the high exhuast piped model Jack Nicholson is on are the only semi-redeeming things in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animations and less","review":"This product is dissappointing. The title says animations and more, but there is only animations. The folders for fonts, sounds and videos are empty. Some of the animations are not animated. The pictures are very poor quality.

As described by Wake in this highly colorful, anecdote-filled book, the metaphor of merchant banking's three-legged stool-one leg for corporate finance, one leg for private banking and investments, and one leg for wholesale banking-was a particularly compelling argument in favor of the Kleinwort-Benson merger, which eventually led to the creation of an investment banking powerhouse. \\"Kleinwort Benson\\" will enthrall those who are interested in how the formerly genteel world of merchant banking, wherein client poaching was an unforgivable transgression and bankers kept banker's hours, was transformed into the extirpative business it is today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Really good book, horrrifying what people can do to others. I was a bit confused at times but overall, a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sad, but true account of violence among teens","review":"This book is so good, I read it about 20 times. I cried when I read how they murdered Shanda, and I thought it was insane how much jealousy those four teenaged girls felt for the 12 year-old. I think it was well written, and the way it was written made the facts more vivid. I think what those girls did to Shanda was terrible and they were lucky that they only got 20 years in prison. I'm sure they regret what they did now, but maybe only because they got caught. I hope they know what they've done...Ruined a 12 year old girls life and their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm sorry for your loss","review":"I live in Indiana. I read the book when I was probably about 12 or 13 years old. And for me to read that was just horrifying I just recently read it again and cried alot during it. It is so sad to have to read about that. I didn't personally know her but one of my friends did. I live in Clark County and I grew up in New Albany, Clarksville, Jeffersonville, and all the surrounding areas. I was surprised to hear that Toni got out. I hope the rest of them rot in prison. They will never know how much heartache they have caused Shanda's family. The Sharer family- if you read this ever know that I am truly sorry for you loss and may Shanda rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mmmmmmmm?","review":"I can not say that I loved this book! Its a true story and very well written. Very sorry for Shanda and her parents. I did not hear anny of it here in Switzerland but ............its very sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad story","review":"Awesome book, sad story. Being from Louisville and only a few years younger than Shanda really hit a spot for me bc I've grown up with the punk kids like Laurie, Melinda, and Toni and the followers like hope who wanted to fit in so bad she would go to great lengths to be liked, I feel she should have gotten the same sentence as the rest. She is just as responsible for shandas death as if she'd lit the fire herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Diabolical Crime","review":"I picked up a copy of this book years ago when it was first released. Being from Louisville, KY, I knew it would be a difficult book to read, as I was well aware of the circumstances surrounding this horrendous murder that happened in our own \\"back yard\\" as it were, and most people from this region of the country followed the case from the moment of the murder, to the subsequent arrests, and the painful trial that followed.It is a difficult book to read, without question. But it is a book which must be read, if for no other reason than to understand what horrible things can happen even among young people when a hidden desire to murder is present. It's a cautionary tale of what can go wrong when certain other factors are present, and parents should take a second look at the friends of their children; especially if they see things that trouble them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless. Unintentionally homophobic. Focus is a bit off.","review":"Book is ok as far as true crime goes, but when the author talks about the gay angle it's always that Shanda was forced into it, talked into it and completely at a loss. No comment in that the parents interrogated her for an hour in trying to get her to admit to lesbian activity, and the author takes great pains to say that Shanda was not a lesbian unlike the fighting coke snorting bunch that killed her. She was just experimenting.The author also misses out on Amanda who is the only interesting character in the book. He pretty much dismisses her as a dyke and doesn't mind the fact that parents shun her for that reason.Ok if you like books about white trash girls going dyke and getting killed but skip the moralizing please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complete Tragedy","review":"Both \\"Little Lost Angel\\" and \\"Cruel Sacrifice\\" cover the Shanda Sharer murder, and I recommend that you read both. \\"Cruel Sacrifice\\" presents a lot of background on the four young killers, while the focus of \\"Little Lost Angel\\" is Shanda Sharer. Thus, both books approach this horrific tragedy from different viewpoints.This is a story of a complete tragedy. Not just twelve-year-old Shanda's gruesome murder, but the wasted lives of her assailants moved me deeply. Like any great book, both \\"Little Lost Angel\\" and \\"Cruel Sacrifice\\" were educational in the best sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken hearted for this \\"little lost angel\\".","review":"I read this book four years ago and still remember every vivid detail.

My heart is broken for this young girl and her family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defienetly a good game","review":"Although it takes some getting used to(especially as Alien), Aliens Vs Predator 2 is an excellent game, both for multiplayer Deathmatch goodness for for the campaigns.

I'm running a dual G5 and it glitches, chops and crashes all the time. Its been over 8 months since Macplay and The Omni Group have known about the multiplayer problem with Mac OS 10.3 and they have done nothing about it.

As soon as it arrived, I tried it with my original sunshade frame (the hazardous fabric has been removed completely!) and it works great!Remember, you need to use this Kiddopotamus UV sunshade with the stroller comes with sunshade because this UV sunshade needs frame to support it to be lifted.

I keep it folded up in the back pocket of the driver's seat in my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just perfect","review":"We just received this and it is just what we needed! It fits perfect, is easy to install and take off, and really provides wonderful sun protection. It will only work on strollers that have a top canopy, so make sure that is what you have. It is made of a very stretchy fabric and it is not waterproof, but it will keep a little sprinkle off of the baby for a short while just in case. Please parents, if you plan on doing anything outdoors with your baby/toddler in the stroller, provide them with some sun protection!! This item is Perfect for that!

This item is very easy to give your babies the comfort they need from the sun :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, not bad at all.","review":"Not bad, but not insanely good. It was very informative, and I felt that the author really made an effort to appeal to the sexual needs of all of her readers - male, female, gay, bi, sexually dominating or submissive, ect. I thought I really knew everything there was to know, but I didn't. Frottage? Who knew?The first couple of chapters may be a source of frustration for those of us who are already hard-core size acceptance people because it's making the effort to first and foremost dismiss a new readers self-hatred. But a chapter or two isn't much against an entire lifetime of cultural brain washing, and it was necessary for size-acitivism rookies.I didn't find it particularly engrossing though.

Gave this movie to a spanish speaking friend,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmospheric chiller","review":"For me a good horror film incorporates the following three elements:1) A fast moving narrative that conveys a sense of mystery or foreboding doom that is dispelled only at the end.2) The usual jump in the seat shock and scare tactics facilitated by the soundtrack.3) Enough shadows, haunting objects (dolls for example) and eerily common noises that have me suspecting the dark nooks and corners of my own house.\\"The Orphanage\\" delivers reasonably well on all three fronts. However what makes a scary movie great is that one truly chilling/macabre scene or revelation that makes your hair stand on end and haunts your memories and dreams long after the DVD rental goes back. On that aspect this movie failed to do the trick for me. Sure, there are couple of scenes where you have your face covered in anticipation of what's going to come next. But none that had a blood curdling effect on me. For that reason alone, I give this otherwise fine movie 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Suspense","review":"This movie is well written and played out.

Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little Disappointed","review":"First I would like to say that overall I did enjoy this movie. It was both visually elegant and compelling. The acting was also nicely done. However, the movie just didn't grab me in the way that \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" did.This film followed the same basic premise of telling a child's ghost/fairy story to adults. However, \\"The Orphanage\\" just failed in being entirely original in it's ability to update/retell that same basic formula. The movie ended up feeling like a cross between \\"Poltergeist\\" and \\"Pan's Labyrinth,\\" with a little bit of M. Night Shyamalan thrown in for good measure.While watching it, it all seemed to work. But after it finished I was left feeling somehow cheated by the story, it just didn't feel like it fully came together at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooks","review":"While this movie isn't exactly downright scary for seasoned horror fans, it does have its share of genuine spooky moments, which says a LOT these days.

It feels a bit derivative of the previous spanish horror films.The picture quality could have been superb, but because of the laziness of today's video divisions of the studios, they neglected to remove or mask the running white spots that ruin the picture.What is the purpose of blu ray with its amazing depth and color and resolution when all these white spots ruin the image.

The spoken language is Spanish only, with English subtitles.","review":"The Orphanage is not a bad movie, with ok story line, good filming and acting,but, in my opinion left much to be disired because the spoken language is Spanish, only. Yes, I failed to read the fine print on the DVD specs before buying it, and assumed that it had an English voice track, which it does not - regretable, I think, leaving English speaking viewers to try to follow the story with subtitles only. If you want to do that, go for it. - allstar"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected so much more","review":"I LOVE scary/suspense movies and I've been waiting to see this movie for awhile. Previews made it look so scary. It had only Spanish dialogue with English subtitles, which make it hard to get totally into the movie because you have to keep looking down to read. I was expecting a very suspenseful supernatural thriller and this movie just did not deliver. Sure the kid with the mask was kinda creepy but that is about the extent of it. The trailers are probably the scariest part of the film, everything else was a big yawn. For me this movie was a huge disappointment. I feel they could have done so much more with it. My recommendation is to wait until it comes on regular tv to watch it. I was almost bored enough to not even finish the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch this & keep an open mind!","review":"My mother & I went to see this movie not realizing it was in Spanish.

No gore.If you have no familiarity with Spanish, don't let that deter you from watching this movie!

The movie does a great job of presenting a puzzle that the mother has to solve to get her son back. The movie is scary, but the gore is at a minimum level.

For those who claim this rips off the poltergeist, then how many other movies have ripped off of it? The others too?? Just because there's a creepy old lady who is a medium doesn't mean its ripping off of anything.. Almost every ghost story who has a medium, you can be sure its going to be a very creepy old woman..

In this case, the subject at hand is the human body. They do a very nice job of covering all the main systems of the body, at a level appropriate for the target audience.Ruiz' illustrations are spot-on replicas of what Seuss himself would have done. Rabe's narration is quite good, but just a tad below the master's work - granted, her hands are tied a bit by the subject matter.In summary, I took off one star, since it doesn't quite read like a Seuss book, but the book is still highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 year old loves it!","review":"We bought this for our 4 year old son after he showed an interest in skeletons.

I have many OXO kitchen tools that work just fine ( i.e. see my review for the apple corer and divider). Whenever I used this one on a ripe Mango (whether the Mango was peeled or not) I got smush. I even tried cutting the bottom off of the fruit to stabilize it prior to my splitting attempts as recommended by one of the Amazon reviewers. Smush again.

Once it was halved, I chopped the mango in the skin then removed it fairly evenly from the skin. Not as waste-free as with avocados, it did leave a little meat on the skin that I scraped off, so there was a little mushy fruit. I think it probably won't work so well with larger mangos.

Oxo has not changed a thing. After a dozen uses over three months I found that the first few mangoes, if not too ripe, are doable but take finesse and strength. Not for arthritis sufferers. The blade dulls rapidly despite careful, ideal hand washing. If the mango is ripe enough to eat, the bottom quarter crushes, requiring tearing the seed and remaining pieces from the cutter. Cutting the thicker end off helps but by then you might just as well use a knife. I find a grapefruit knife with its curved, serrated blade allows a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"no hassel","review":"Unique tool that take the hassel out of getting the fruit out.

(I generally shy away from them because of the time it takes to prepare...)Much to my chagrin, this cutter just doesn't, well, cut it. Makes absolute mush out of all but the firmest mangoes. The problem is not with the cutter, so much as the mango, itself. If nature made a mango with a uniformly-sized and -placed pit, the cutter would work beautifully. Rarely are pits centered perfectly in the fruit, so the blades of the cutter run into the pit, rather than slice around it most of the time.

I got it as a gift because everyone knows that I love mangoes but all pits are not the same size. Honestly it's a good concept but wasn't thought out. It's so easy to cut the fruit using a large knife and then use a paring knife to get the fruit off of the skin. If this actually worked it would still take longer than the usual knife method anyway. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work for me","review":"I have tried serveral times to get a clean cut into the mango, but all it does is get stuck on the pit and it smashes the mango."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mango Splitter","review":"Excellant product, easy to use, easy to clean in dishwasher, and kind to your hands. Be sure the mango is as ripe as you want it before using splitter. This splitter will even cut unripe mangos and you'll be disappointed in the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Performance","review":"I love to eat mangos so when I saw this I thought umm, this might be a fun tool to add to my kitchen. After testing it out a few times I decided its not that great because if the mango is not really firm you end up crushing the bottom of the fruit, if the seed is not just alligned with the blades then they get stuck and you have to re set them. I prefer to peel the mango then slice it off of the seed this give me the best restults and least wastage."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little mango help","review":"I was skeptical of this device, because the opening for the mango seed doesn't look big enough for it. After testing this on a few mangos, I give it 5 stars.

The downside is that it is difficult to separate the flesh from the seed. It usually results in a mashed mango using traditional methods.The OXO Mango Splitter makes it foolproof to quickly and easily split the fruit while simultaneously removing the hard seed.So much better for making massive amounts of Mango Salsa!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So close and yet so far!","review":"This is a great idea that wasn't thought through (or tested enough) by Oxo! The problem (that could be easily corrected) is that the blades are simply not sharp enough (right from the beginning!) The blades won't pierce the skin (I have use a knife to start the cuts) and then, as others have observed, if the mango is truly ripe (soft), as the blade is forced down through the tough skin (a mango skin is always tough!), it just mashes the lower part of the fruit. I still use it because it's easier than a peeler and a knife when I eat the mango right out of the skin leaning over the sink, but for any other purpose when you would like nice cuts of fruit, this is a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea gone wrong","review":"I've used this product several times and have yet to find a mango with a pit small enough to to fit through the splitter. That's a fatal flaw. If you happened to find a small enough mango you would still have to find a way to anchor or balance it on end while you shoved the splitter through the fruit. That probably won't happen if you've peeled the mango or have not correctly determined the orientation of the oblong pit. So, at the very least, the fruit must be small and unpeeled if you're to stand a chance using this product successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky","review":"This is really bulky and not worth the space it takes up. It doesn't work for very large mangoes because they don't fit through and it doesn't work for very small mangoes because it leaves too much on the pit. And forget using it on a ripe mango, it will squash it and have juices running everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do it","review":"Gave it a shot but it simply mashes the mango; at no point has it made much of an inroad on any mango that it has encountered. The knife edges aren't particularly sharp, either. Avoid this and keep hoping for an easy way to get at mangoes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept is good","review":"The concept is great provided that all mango pits are the same size, that the mango is really ripe, and that the skin can be cut without a true blade. The two we tried it on were mush by the time we were through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy","review":"I can't figure out how to get it even with the seed. Too much waste. My kids eat lots of mangos, but it turns out it's easier just to slice them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could send this back","review":"If I hadn't tossed the wrappings and other documentation. I would send this back to Amazon.This so- called gadget that Cook's magazine touted heavily mashed the mangos and lost juices as though it were a juicer. The center blades don't move to adjust to different sized pits and otherwise give you a macerated piece of fruit.My knife, cutting each side away from the pit is as wonderful as ever.If any one finds my paper work, please return it to me and I will get my money back from Amazon.I would give this item 0 000 not a one. there was no room for a zero"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just works.","review":"This elegant little device \\"just works\\". You'll end up with a little flesh left at the ends, but most of the pit will be shaved smooth!This is awesome! I had been avoiding mangoes just because they were so irritating to prep.

This gadget is exactly what I needed to make it easy to get the pit out of the mango. It's true that the pressure squashes the mango and creates juice on the cutting board, but that's nothing compared to just leaving them rot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sharp enough!","review":"Although the handle seems decently sturdy the cutting blade on this tool was near-useless after the first few uses. Definitely NOT sharp enough to cut through the mangoes I buy on a very regular basis. Will go back to using a knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product sucks!","review":"I was very excited to get this mango splitter until I tried to use it. I made certain I had the \\"blade\\" side to the mango and when pressing down, it didn't even penetrate the skin. The more pressure that was applied, only turned the entire mango to mush on the bottom, losing all the great juice. ended up getting out my trustworthy knife and cutting it the traditional way. This iten is a big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A knife works better...","review":"Maybe I just don't get it, but lining this up/holding the mango still/pressing down on the mango hard enough to cut it, is very difficult. I just went back to slicing it with a knife. It is bulky and takes up too much space in my drawer. I gave it a 2/5 due to the fact that I'm sure someone else uses it effectively and I really like the OXO brand and have many, many other tools from them that I love. I however, wish I would have saved the $10 bucks on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well.","review":"I bought this mango splitter based on the rave reviews from other people but it just didn't work for me. It cuts down about halfway, but as soon as it gets to the tougher area of mango around the pit, it can't go any further. If you try to force it, you just end up squashing the bottom of the mango. It just made a huge mess. After trying about three mangos, I put it away and went back to peeling and slicing them by hand. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love The Beast (USA - Two Disc Special Edition)","review":"Great true life story and produced well.

I've had a car in my garage for 15 years that has been waiting for me to rediscover my zest for life.

Overall, a very interesting, well-written account of the events that transpired. My favorite part is the actual police transcript of the Abe Sada interview and confession.

You know how at the bottom of a bag of regular Chex Mix you'll find that Chex piece that has been super-saturated with all of the seasonings and magic pixie dust they put in there? That's how every piece of Bold Party Blend Chex Mix tastes. So freaking good and so addictive.Yes, they changed the formula recently (substituting ingredients and dialing down the intensity of the flavor), but this is still the snack food of the gods. A bag of this stuff will definitely ruin you for regular Chex Mix, not to mention just about every other kind of snack food.Oh, and the super-saturated Chex pieces at the bottom of the Bold Party Blend bag...sheer awesomeness."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like It!","review":"Chex Mix Bold is tasty, although the mix differs from the package shown. I like it better than the old version, as I found the round crackers in the old version rather bland. The cereal is crispy, the rye crisps crunchy and the flavor is just the right bold for me (there's a similar store brand version of this at Food Lion and it is way too oniony for my taste buds!). My only complaint about the new Chex Mix Bold is that the pretzels aren't really crispy and sometimes taste on the stale side, ruining an otherwise perfect snack food!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining!","review":"The dvd is a great addition to any DVD box set collection.

Plus, there are many, many blank spaces in the book, prompting one to wonder what got left out (and who cares, anyway?).In addition, the pages begin to fade out towards the end of the book, as if she printed it on a home printer and it ran out of ink. This book deserves maybe a half a star, but that's not an option on Amazon.The factual errors are simply amazing.

Then, the noise started. The decibels rose until I was unable to talk on the telephone without shouting, much less sleep. When the unit quit completely, the mystery was solved. The internal pump which ejects condensation through a hose had failed. The compressor iced, the fan banged against the ice.

I grew up with the early keyboard-interface games with CGA graphics and fell in love with the style of game. As far as I'm concerned, the games could still play like that or could even still be on pencil and paper. The graphics don't matter to me that much. I like collections. I also have all the Ultima games in a CD-ROM collection and the King's Quest Series. It's worth it to get all the games at once. I bought this collection because I played Dark Savant. In my opinion, that is one of the BEST RPGs ever made. It takes at least 6 months to complete and is so detailed and so wonderful. This set of games is worth it for that one game. The other ones are still awesome. Of course, if all you care about are graphics and sound, you might not find their charm.

Overall it was more difficult to use and just didn't have the same mystique that the original apple version possessed.

Tediousness sets in when you have to backtrack several times without advnacing in the story. Monsters always reapear and they are always the same. Graphics are good, in pseudo-3D.

But they try to make it look state of the art by having their lips move, but it looks more like cheap clay animation. They also repeat the faces and NPC models, just cutting off the beard someone has and calling that person a whole new person. And the voice acting, don't even get me started on that.

The major problem is a noise the starter makes every time my car starts. My car does start and continues running, but when initially starting up the starter creates a long loud grinding noise. There are no other reviews of this starter, so this issue is worrying me.--Written January 14, 2011The starter completely failed me 6 weeks ago, coming home from the grocery store. Because of school and my job I have not been able to consult anyone about this issue. I use my car often, but not for distances over 25 miles. I am not sure if it is the starter or another problem.

Now, luckily a little less than a year later, it is SUPER loud, it revs up, rattles, and rolls. It kind of sounds like a dishwasher disposal. I called up Frigidaire and they said that my model is unrepairable and must be replaced.

It has several features I like better - thermostat on the unit and an auto fan setting that manages the air flow to your desired temp. The unit also seems to blow out colder air.

You do get used to it, and next year I will try putting a foam strip under it, which might improve that problem.

An hour later, I found that a little rubber seal on the axle that drives the fans had rotted and fallen into the centrifugal fan compartment.I don't know if that qualifies as planned obsolescence, but it amounts to the same thing. Most people would have bought a new unit.

Very disappointed in the quality and performance.1. During install, the pull-out accordian style louvers tore in several places. I didn't use excessive force or mishandle them in any way. The plastic is too rigid and thin and when you expand them they start to crack at the seams. There is also a gap between the plastic and the track the louvers sit in.2.

Having read all, and I do mean all of Pike's books, this is by far the worst. It doesn't even rank near The Season of Passage or even his young adult books. I too had to stop and ponder just how absurd the end of the book was. He tries to give a medical justification to a way out there scenario. Then the end just - ends. It does close the story, but leaves you wondering a lot of things. It does contain a story within a story, but in reality, the plot of the inner story has nothing to do with the plot. It was just a way to introduce a sexual relationship (which there are waaay to many of). So my advice is to either wait for the paperback or borrow it from a friend. It isn't worth the price.

Unfotunately it was weak and i feel like i found the only bad Christopher Pike novel, and that in itself is pretty upsetting. The only reason i finished it was because i kept thinking that the ending would be brilliant and deep, as his novels usually are, and would make the entire novel worthwhile. It wasn't.

The full installer, which is recommended if you want most of the awesome gameplay, even music, is only about 560MB's of space, but you'd still need 600MB give or take, it's really not that much compared to the heightened memory nowadays.Prompt shipment was a plus as well, but I forgot the seller's username. Oh well.Anyway, this is DarkMike signing out. See ya."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book","review":"This book really kept my attention. The development of the characters was great.

The greatest feature, in my opinion, is that the newest input turned on recieves attention and the switcher automatically switches to it. For instance, I have my DVR box on all the time, on input #1, but when I turn the Xbox on, the switcher automatically switches to input #2, and when I turn it off, switches back to the TV. I'm glad I have the remote, but honestly, I haven't even used it yet. There is no need in my sitution. I know it is nearly the least expensive unit available on Amazon, but I don't know why anyone would need anything more. This Case Logic unit works AWESOME. And I'm using it with 46 CENT, AMC cables.

The music is more assured, the lyrics have greater emotional resonance, and her voice is more confident. Olson has honky-tonk in her heart and retro-pop in her soul, but she's smart enough to transcend mere genre work. She writes about the stuff of normal life -- hearing your lover on the phone to their ex-lover, living in a neighborhood you love but your friends think is creepy -- but spins it into something grander. The title tune is an unabashed love song (\\"You 'n me together is so much better than my best yesterday.\\"), but it's delivered with so much heart, and such a lack of mawkish sentiment, that it delights. As does this terrific new outing from one of our great undiscovered talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"it[s bad]","review":"This is a good game, but having to enter a sixteen character password is unforgiveable.

I was assuming it would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"This game isn't even worth your time, sure it looks decent but it actually is a pain and tedious to play. It has a simple setup of: the car is centered in the screen, the track simply curves left and right. Sure you can upgrade your cars and build your own tracks, but even that is severely limited and restricted, (for example, you can only add turns on a small graph, and can't even change the background or music, etc.) Avoid this game at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be.","review":"This games is only okay.

I only bought it because it was the only decent looking game.., but that's all it is. Just nice graphics, but other than that, I can't stand it. It's comparable to those little 15 dollar racing games for 5 year olds with the picture of a car in the center, and you have a little steering wheel and the track just circles around your car. The handling is really bad, and you can spin out way too easily. Save yourself some money and frustration and don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Racer","review":"If you like racing games, this one is for you. The graphics are nothing short of spectacular. The game has licenses for some of Japan's most well known companies (ie Honda, Toyota, Mitsubishi). The cars looks great and the control is outstanding. The only drawback this game has is the fact that it was changed from the origianl Japanese game in the saving department. It has a password save system instead of battery back up, but otherwise it's a great game. It definitely displays the greatness of 32 bit racing. This is the GBA version of Grand Tourismo. With an outstanding total of 48 upgradeable cars...this is a must for racing fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow?","review":"I loved this game and couldn't put it down but then after I lost my password and the game lost its charm. The graphics are good but the game play is something that takes skill. The game is very realistic (except for the fact that your going 160).Another feature is you earn cars and can even earn parts for your car thus making the car go faster or giving the car a tune up.

But that's all.It's a thin sheet of hot-stamped steel coated with shiny Nickel that was cut out in a \\"tray with handles\\" shape. If you imagine cutting out a sheet of paper in a \\"tray with handles\\" shape, and embossing a (nice enough) design around the edge, then you've got the basic idea. It looks deceptively pretty in the photos, but it will never be mistaken for very nice serveware in person.It is sturdier than disposable plastic trays or paper plates. It is not, however, really sturdy -- just better than disposable dishes.If the price is low enough, however, you may find that this fills the bill for informal functions.

There is some of this in the book but just a few pages at a fifth grade level.The author's dietary advice is no different than the standard consensus of minimizing carbs and sugar, and increasing good fats, lean meats, and fiber. My preference for this information is the South Beach diet book. I had hoped that Cabot's book would cover liver disease as effectivey as the South Beach covered weight gain, insulin, and diabetes.

The first 60 or so pages are explanation about the liver with some testimonials and then there are the sections on how to actually \\"do\\" the liver diet. Lastly, lots of recipes! And being less than 200 pages and cramming all that in gets a 5 star in my ratings book!I like any book that focuses on what we can do to help our health that is written by a doctor.

I did learn a few things, and the diet itself looks interesting, though I have not tried it. But to me, the book was more self-promoting than educational. I was hoping for more facts, supported by statistics, and studies, rather it was if the author was trying to show her colleagues that her ideas were valid. They may be, I am not in any position to argue, but I was hoping for more information on the liver itself, and the possible disorders. I found only one paragraph with my condition discussed.Still, I am not sorry that I read it, and like I said earlier, I did learn some things, I am just sorry I didn't find it in the library. I hope this helps in your decision making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good basis, too much hocum","review":"If you want a book which will give you good eating guidelines then this will be a good buy. However, I do object to the unproven hokum attached to this book. Sandra Cabot complains in the beginning of the book that people have denigrated her methods without trying it themselves. However, there is no reference to proper testing within her book to prove her claims. One other reviewer states you have to have a positive attitude to make this work - great, but don't use that mantra to accept any old hokum that comes your way.

I have an older copy and it starts off with a full chapter of testimonies from happy customers. The author defends herself and the diet vigorously which surprised me -everyone I know who has followed it says it works miracles.You are shown that your liver is one of your largest body parts and what a huge effect it has on your health. An easy to follow eating plan is given -you have lots of choices and can tailor your own plan to suit yourself, or use the book for a guide as you go -it is full fo recipes and meal ideas.Probably the best thing about this diet is the flexibility, and for me, the fact that you don't have to limit your portion sizes and starve yourself.

After a raining weekend with a little bit of leakage, but mostly dry, we put the tent up to dry out at home. Within one day, 3 of the main poles broke at the seams. And of course, the \\"10 year warranty\\" didn't cover the poles. We're considering replacement poles, but it might be worth it to just invest in a different tent.

The second night we used aluminum foil and cardboard placed on top of the tent to keep the roof from leaking.

The kids love them so much I will definitely purchase a few more with the fort. We're very happy with our purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Playmobil figure","review":"I purchased the small Western fort which did not come with figures. So these were purchased to go with it. Typical good quality of Playmobil. My grandson has been playing with Playmobil since the age of 2. He now just turned 8 and still loves to play with his castles and forts and figures. I like them because they have weapons easy enough for the kids to put on the figures and they are moveable to all positions. I often hear him talking away as he plays. Great for the imagination. Little pricey for small figures, but definitely worth it. These are not found in the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"God save us from horrible experiments like this...","review":"I was itching to purchase this game when it was advertised, cause frankly, on paper it sounds GOOD. The reality however falls waaayyy short of the mark. First off, this game DEFINES linear gameplay! There is NO where to go but exactally where you need to. Second, there are NO random combat scenes, which to me is essential for an RPG. Third, combat is awkward and horriblly frustrating, not to mention NO fun.Talk about false advertising at it's finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that much fun","review":"I'd say the Gamespot review is right on target. Neat graphics, totally linear storyline, weird combat system, not enough ammunition.I suppose the lack of ammunitions does a good job of simulating the tension that you might feel entering the secret city, not knowing what's around the next corner, but it's mostly annoying.I played for a few hours, made it past the first boss, then just got fed up and bored.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Homework or Orthodontia","review":"Playing this game was alot like having to do all of the chapter and review questions in the first 200 pages of algebra book. The game looked nice enough, and the gameplay was interesting, but that is where it ends. The only reason I felt obligated to finish this game was to punish myself for wasteing money on it. Unless you are a total masochist stay away from this game and its terrible story and even worse voice acting. Do yourself a favor, take your ten bucks to the hardware store, buy some vice grips, and practice your amatuer dentistry on your self. It will be more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool story line","review":"It has a good story line and cool game play but it lacks something I don't know, maybe a naked chick for the gamers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Margaret knows she's too plain, too tall, and too outspoken for any man to want to marry her. She's not looking for romance. All she wants is to prove to her father that she can manage their ranch as well as any man could. But when her father hires Josiah Cutler as the new foreman,Margaret's dreams are knocked flat. The newcomer seems determined to prove that Msrgaret is not needed.As the days go by, Margaret begins to suspect Josiah of a far more dangerous schems as well, one that will endanger all her fathers hard-earned money. She'll do anything to protect her father and his ranch- and yet for so reason her heart is torn. There's something about Josiah Cutler that fascinates her- but surely she cant be falling in love with a bank robber...?I loved this book. Colleen Cable is a wonderful author and this is a great story about love forgivness and never giving up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Azzarello has done much better","review":"100 Bullets writer Brian Azzarello was handed the task of revamping Marvel's Luke Cage AKA Power Man, Hero for Hire; a 70's super hero into the modern day and slapping the book with Marvel's MAX title (basically the equivalent to an R-rated movie). While the art by Richard Corben is superb, Azzarello's writing is a surprising disappointment. Cage has been turned from a just trying to do the right thing reluctant hero into a gangsta thug just trying to get paid. He's not much caring about the job he has accepted (avenging the death of a slain girl) and comes off more like a gangster rapper than a super hero. Brian Michael Bendis, who has given Luke Cage a great characterization in Alias and Daredevil, should have been the scribe here, and even though Azzarello is a superb writer in his own right, Cage just comes off as pointless. All in all, Cage is a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, difficult read","review":"I have taken 3 years of thermodynamics with different books. This book being the worst! I felt I 'delearned' after trying to read some of the chapters. The early chapters were good in explaining the basis of thermodynamics. The rest of the book is way too general, the equations are derived for extremely general cases and it makes trying to relate to real world situations near impossible. The problems at the end of the chapters are not easy and there are NO good examples within the chapters. The problems are written poorly and often open to interpretation so students can get 5 or 6 different answers to one problem. If you are forced to use this book I would recommend that you do NOT read the chapters, only work the problems. Buy a different book to study thermodynamics from."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I wish there was an option to give this negative stars. Or at least zero.If you think this book is good, then it is because of one of two things. Either: 1.) You have NOT HAD to read this book (i.e., for a graduate course in chemical thermo), or 2.) You are a sadistic professor who likes to see their students suffer. There is nothing here of any value. The problems are near impossible to solve, and the text does not explain terms at all. The so called \\"postulatory approach\\" provides zero insight into this subject. If you are looking for a text to learn thermo, then keep looking. If you have to buy this book, you have my prayers. If you have to use this book for a class, then I would HIGHLY suggest that you pick up Sandler's \\"Chemical and Engineering Thermodynamics.\\" You will use it 10X more then Tester's text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Note to Professors: PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE THIS BOOK!!!!","review":"I am taking this course as a graduate student and I have taken three previous courses in Thermodynamics. I know less about this subject and am more confused then I was before I read this book. In my undergraduate degree I did really well in the thermodynamics courses I took and felt like I had a good understanding of the topic. You wouldn't think one book could undo three solid semesters of learning Thermodynamics, but it did for me. The title of this book implies that it is application based, but it is just a pure lie. I am completely unsatisfied with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I found this book to be almost worthless in my efforts to learn thermodynamics at a graduate level.

It was awful. The text was very poor at explaining the concepts. The questions in the book were poorly worded, making solving them a matter of interpretation.

It looks like there are better texts in the field."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst","review":"It is impossible to understand how a prof can choose this book. I am an grad student and forced to buy this book. This book contains no useful engineering applications whatsoever. It is very confusing and hard to follow.

This book was so wonderful i want to read more of her books! I am so thankful I found this.I Wanna say that if you want to read this book simply becuase your a drewling fangirl and want more howl, to not read it, becuase the way Miazaki potrayed Howl, and how he is in the book, is very diffrent.

I knew it wouldn't be a sequel so I wasn't disappointed when I read and did not find an entire continuation to the first. Because of this, I was able to enjoy the book to its fullest, and especially the dialogue which is often very funny without ever reaching the ridiculous.I recommend this book to anyone that wants to continue the magic of the world Diana Wynne Jone's created in the first novel, in addition to anyone that wishes to learn what happens to Sophie and Howl as well as meet some interesting and lovable new characters! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted fantasy set in a world of magic.","review":"I remember reading this several years ago, after I had read most of Diana Wynne Jones' other novels.

Abdullah, a young man in Arabia, sells carpets for a living in a little hut in the merchant district. He lives a happy, if unsuccesful life, besides the hassle with dealing with his relatives who are trying to get him to marry. Alas, he dreams of someone more beautiful than the pigs his relatives want him to marry. His life changes one day when a stranger sells him a magic carpet. So begins a wonderful tale of magical Djin and a beautiful princess.

The only problem with it is not the toy but the fact that if pieces your kid likes are lost you can't order them without buying a whole new set. My kids are not fat they don't want to go to Mc Donalds because they see the name. If you have a problem with this toy because it says Mc Donalds on it then you probably let your kids get away with anything in your house.

He knows it is in grandma's toy box and as soon as we go visit, he runs straight for it and puts the head piece on and just waits for us to tell him what we want. It is good for listening and memory as he awaits our order, and there are enough pieces that you never seem to run out of variations when ordering, and then he presents them on the tray which he calls the table. The pieces are all big enough so there is no danger of choking, and the drawer opening and the noise when you run the credit card through just help make it a little more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for simulation of todays fast food: I guess","review":"My kids enjoy playing mcdonalds drive through with this, as my sister brought this with another back pack of extra food, needless the say the boxes for the apple pies lasted a few days, the french fries were out of the box, not that they cared, the cartons for the hot cakes get dented and smashed really easily. the food on the other hand last very long, and believe me the kids could care less about boxes as long as the simulation of their favorite fast food restuarant is noticable and they know what it is. So would I buy it, I would, because they are not concerned with the little things we are concerned about, they love the cash register and fake credit card. We have lost the key a dozen times.

The actual toy is pretty durable but the cash drawer is already not staying closed well if it isn't locked with the key. The paper money is pretty sad, ours also ripped trying to get it out of the package since it was taped on. The coins are fused together, and that doesn't make much sense. However, my daughter loves the hat and headset and takes everyone's order with a smile. The register is also a calculator, so thats cool. She is a bit shy, but has no problem asking everyone around for their order and then fixing up the food. I do wish that it came with more food though rather than having to buy that as well. Its worth the $20 we paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criticism of Kindle Edition","review":"This book addresses medieval archaeology and architecture and its text depends on the quality of its images and floor plans. The Kindle Edition does a deplorable job of transferring the images and plans from the print version to this electric edition.

Finally, severalmonths ago, I secured the remastered dvd version from Amazon. After viewing it a couple of times, it renewed my belief inthe fine acting, story line, brutal realism, and stirring musical score, that I had remembered from my youth. Even thoughher part was minimal, the pairing of Rod Taylor & Yvette Mimieux brought back the (magic) memories of their performancesin 1960's The Time Machine.

There is a great lack in consistency in the writing which makes it very difficult to watch any episode in its entirety."},{"rating":"1","title":"potty humor and other garbage","review":"I enjoyed the \\"cute\\" Sarah in previous years on SNL, so I was excited to see her get her own show at Comedy Central (CC).The very last time I tried to watch her show, I vowed to change the channel at her first mention of rectum, scrotum, or penis. It didn't take long, and I never tuned in again. Apparently she has nothing else.Potty humor may be A#1 when you are twelve years old, but I've outgrown it myself (now in my 40's). I'm no prude, but my intelligence is insulted when pubic nonsense and sphincter play is all Ms. Silverman has to offer in the way of \\"comedy\\".If you really love the vulgarity of the CC Roasts, then The Sara Silverman Program may be perfect for you, as it is only slightly less profane. If you want to be \\"grossed out\\" let Sarah give it a shot.Sorry to say, it is her forte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny? Not!","review":"This show has nowhere to go but up. Unfortunately I will not be sticking around long enough to know. It's for people who think drugs are funny, per se, that being gay is hilarious,and mention of sundry body parts or bathroom functions evokes laughter... I could go on with this list but prefer not to.I will admit that Ms. Silverman tries very hard to be funny, and apparently she is to a certain audience, but the trying is too obvious. Other comics, Richard Pryor, for example, can touch on the same or similar topics, but his delivery seems all but unplanned. However, Sarah is easier to look at than Richard--I'll give her that.All in all, I was disappointed in this, after reading several glowing reviews. I just hope that no one will respond that I am anti-Semitic or sexist or too jaded and un-hip to \\"get it.\\" I got it: I just didn't like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sarah Silverman","review":"Love the comedy.

Whatever...","review":"You never know what you're going to get when you buy a comedy. You hope, at least, if it's not hilarious, there will still be a few laughs. I haven't found one in this DVD. One of the main things you need is to like the comedian, in some small way, but Silverman is beyond that. She's a Kostanza without Larry David's redeeming genius for observation. Which is to say she annoys, she's puerile, petty, etc. etc. and there's just nothing funny about her. As cheap as it is, this is still a waste of money. If you turned her on, free to air, you'd change the channel.

He played with it for about 5 minutes and was very frustrated because the arm would not stay in place, it kept crashing down no matter how securely kid (or parents) would try to set it in place. Unsafe for fingers or anyone in the way of the arm when it goes.

This game just requires a little bit of micromanagement. Make a soldier with a good sight range to recon first.

It's not but it could have been if the developers had just spent a bit more time on it. The main problem is that the game play works on the questing buddy theory and the little buggers won't stay in formation. It does not matter to the game if you use auto formation, which is a feature of the game that is TOTALLY USELESS, or if you try to put them in formation yourself. Inevitably your little mage who has a health of like 30 and is only useful in that she heals will run to the front and die a horrible death. After only two days of this I wish that I could hear her scream while she died.Also, the developers chose to create almost impossible scenarios early in the game before the characters have either the experience or the equipment to fight the swarms of monsters that the developers substituted for creative game play. Who needs creativity for an RPG game when you can just use hordes of monsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Are The Fish Supposed To Go?","review":"There are books out there that are sensitive to the interaction of fish and plants.

It looks like the publishes went to the library and collected a bunch of ideas from other books and through them together. I can't say that they give any bad advice, except in my opinion they mislabled two plants. Plus, there is a lack of a coherent theme through the book. They combine a few ideas that IMHO don't work together (this is from personal experience). Also the section on water chemistry is confusing, and before I read the book I knew it flat. The pictures are okay except they are all stock photos and you will see them someplace else in other books. Don't waste you money on this book. I would give it zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just \\"OK\\"","review":"Less than impressive small, thin paperback. Profiles only a small amount of species.

It's not full of jargon and it's very user friendly. It breaks down the tasting process in different tasting sessions in a hands-on format.

The games DO NOT work on modern computers, and even on our old one that runs Windows 98 that we keep in the spare room, only #3 loaded. On that one the colors were garish and distracting and the bars and animations that in the newer versions tell you of your characters health and danger status were ineffective. When you add this to the fact that there is no hard copy of the manuals, game-play becomes a constant frustration.There IS a \\"Strategy Guide\\" available that is minimally helpful but nowhere nearly as good as the ones for 6 through 9.All in all, and even though I am a big fan of older games in general - the Games and the Guide were a BIG disappointment.

It distracted from the speakers' words and many times I strained to make out what they were saying. Visual montages especially the fractals though lovely were excessive - both hypnotic and overstimulating.There also seemed to be little continuity running throughout the movie - was more of separate vignettes of individual teachers.

Their collective attempt to convey information about a complex topic dealing with the afterlife, though appreciated, fails miserably. What bothers me about this video, almost to a degree of torture, are the excessive and highly distractive fractals appearing in the visual montages when one member of the cast, Neal Donald Walsh, monotonously and unconvincingly expresses (in a whispy voice) his own belief in life after death of the physical body. The fractals are not only very annoying, but have nothing to do with the subject matter of the film. The movie is about a fascinating topic, but its message is poorly delivered and its credibility is significantly diminished. In short, based on my own personal experience, I would not recommend this DVD to anyone, but would ask them to look elsewhere for information about possible immortality achieved through changes of states of existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased by the way death is protrade","review":"as a believer in after life and the death process I have read many books on death and the afterlife and i thought this DVD was a nice way to sum it all up in a visual, commentary type way as some people find it more effect to have some thing in visual as appose to reading about it.I think the DVD was very well made, exspecially in accordance with my own beliefs.A spiritual path is an individual one and each one must decide what is true for them, perhaps this DVD may help some one who is either dying, finding peace in death itself or knows someone who is dying and this may help you to help them threw the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product","review":"This product was advertised as a brand new JVC Camcorder charger compatible with a variety of JVC batteries including a JVC BN-V14U.

Along the way readers are also led down the path to development of early literacy skills. Lucy's speech rhymes; she is surrounded by people and things familiar to young children; and she explores colors, parts of the body, and animal sounds. In the end she finds a beautiful world to share with her friends, one she would never have explored if her voice had not disappeared. As an added bonus, this brightly illustrated multicultural book provides the adult an opportunity to discuss laryngitis, a common medical ailment, with their children in a context they will identify with and understand. Adults and children alike will love reading about Lucy, and will learn on many different levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lance Loved Lucy","review":"I am six years old.

The main character Lucy is a precocious little girl filled with spunk and vivacity! Her loosing her voice and the ensuing search to find it, is filled with wonderful discoveries and rhyme that thrill the hearts of children and adults alike. The story, along with vibrant, colorful illustrations makes the book a page-turner. Ms. Thompson, Lucy's creator, has succeeded in bringing parent and child back together for that old style bonding through reading. Providing a \\"Smartie\\" at the end of the story (a short synopsis of the medical ailment hampering the main charactar) is a most unique way to introduce health issues to young audiences.Hats off to Ms. Thompson. Many years ago I enjoyed sitting with my children and reading their favorite books to them. I can now look forward to sitting and reading this exciting, funfilled, eye catching story to my grandchildren!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the \\"prurient\\" - or the particuarly \\"curious.\\"","review":"It might be helpful to know in advance that this DVD is primarily informational and not visual.

In fact this smells EXACTLY - yes EXACTLY likeXeryus Rouge for Men by Givenchy 3.3oz 100ml EDT Spray. Dries down to an overtly feminine floral/vanilla base. Extremely dissatisfied. However, since both the colognes are extremely popular, it seems there are people who like this kind fragrances.

And even in basic geography he is confused -- calling Indiana southWEST of Illinois. I am strongly considering starting a website devoted to this book's errors. While the broad story is true, even the slightest closer inspection shows endless flaws. Any reader not knowledgeable about organized crime is going to finish this book and be full of tidbits on events that never happened... and if they can't sort fact from fiction, the whole book becomes a waste of time as a historical source.

When he cites an article called \\"Mob Lite\\" stating that there are only 50 outfit members remaining, he left out the part stating that there are at 700-1200 associates remaining and how they are more sophisticated than ever.

The best non pesticide weapon against fast moving carpenter bees (or wasps) is a badminton racket.I've never had a carpenter bee recover from a badminton shot, you don't need the additional electric charge to kill them, just a nice solid swing with as much wrist snap as you can put into it and that will take care of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"I have had 2 of these type of bug zappers before and they worked like a charm this one does not work.

I've used this thing for 3 days now, and with the gnats swarming around my face, I could only come in contact with a couple of them. I tried to swat regular flies, but never got a single one. The bug has to actually touch the electronic wire or it does no good. And believe me, getting the bug to touch the wire is not as easy as it sounds. I finally got tired of trying to swat things with this rather large and heavy racket thing and went back to good old bug spray. It's kind of like swinging a small tennis racket around and my arm got tired of that after several minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute waste of time","review":"I like to be generous with these book reviews, but this book is just a big waste of time. It is all fluff, even though the author tries to redeem it by having a sweet little sidestory of friends helping friends. The book is written in a hip manner that I probably could've read when I was in second grade.

From start to finish, I have played this three times. The option to keep playing after the game \\"ends\\" is a great improvement over the first \\"Fallout\\" game. It can be brutal, so keep your companions alive as long as they are usefull (everyone who sucks up another attack is one less for you). On the down side, this game is addictive. The variations can cause a different tack to be taken every time. The blood level can cause the squemish to shy away, but players can use the options to reduce it a little. On the other hand you can totally annihilate an opponent in a very gruesome manner (ever see a ganster turned to slag, or blown to bits?) and still take time out for the ladies. Character interactions with the NPCs are a vital part of the game, for good or bad, and are just as important as the combat side of things. All in all, brutal, bloody, and fascinating. Great game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite game of all time","review":"My favourite game of all time. I remember spending several nights playing and re-playing this game.

Your village is dying, and you are sent into the world to find a Garden of Eden Creation Kit. Your quest takes you all over the ruined Midwest and West coast. The only downside is that it's just like fallout, with only small improvements to the character interaction modules. A great game? No, but a good one, and worth the money if you really liked the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"Yes, Fallout 2 is one of the best RPG games out there, especially considering the fact that there are no futuristic RPG's in the current market. However, this game requires way to much search and talk. It gets very old very quickly, and you will find yourself with the best equipment on the planet by simply waiting for two different parties to kill each other. I had a flamethrower within one hour of playing that made me nearly invincible. I mean, come on. Unless you are going to play this game without accepting help from NPC's, this really proves no challenge and damages the fun factor. At least the price is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CRPG... ever.","review":"This is simply the best, most immersive, gorgeously detailed, and lovingly crafted computer role-playing game ever. Fallout2 is the next best thing to pen and paper RPG's in my opinion, and is actually better than quite a few classic RPG's I could name. I was hooked after the first 5 minutes and spent about 8 hours a day on the computer until I finished the game, then played some more. That was another beautiful thing about fallout. You can just keep right on going after you beat the game. The character interaction was the best I've ever seen in a CRPG and the combat system is near perfect. Combine this with a complete array of non static skills and tons of detailed weapons/items, as well as a lushly rendered world setting, and you get a CRPG that is unparralelled. At least until Fallout3 comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RPG ever","review":"I have played many other RPG's such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment which are some of the best of the genre but Fallout2 is the best of all by far. The story is intersting and the game is in dpth with different stat layer and lot's of side quests that affect the outcome of the main plot. It makes for many hours, days, weeks, months of gaming fun. I first got this game in 98 or 99 and it is still my favorite and Fallout 1 is really awesome too, just to short. This is a must buy for RPG enthusiasts. It may be to complex for some mainstream gamers but has been on the best seller list, top 20 for a long time, 2 years until a couple of months ago. so buy this game, maybe not from Amazon but elsewhere. PS I don't work here or for the production company. Watch for Fallout 3 and Fallout: Tactics"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great RPG","review":"This is possibly the best computer RPG I have played. The story is engaging and kept me hooked like a good novel. The game really shines in the area of character development. Fallout 2 creates very subtle interactions between skills and character attributes that made the whole process of building and growing my characters exciting and fun. I normally play fantasy RPGs but the post-holocost future theme worked well and I didn't miss the dragons and trolls after the first couple quests. This is a must have for RPG game fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post-apocalyptic rpg set in the wastes of California","review":"This game is pretty cool.

Those looking for a balanced and useful history of India should look elsewhere. Among my issues with the book: the author seems to dismiss any parts of Indian history he does not agree with and just ignores them (in one area, he says \\"From the moment when the Muslims reached India, its history has no further interest. It is a long and monotonous recital of murders massacres, plunder and destruction\\"; in another area, says \\"Hindu scholar looked upon Gandhi as a sort of Antichrist, and made thank-offerings when he was assasinated.

I am an avid reader of history, mostly European and American history, so this was going to be an interesting change. The book turned out to be a major disappointment. First, you couold describe Danielou as a Hindu-phile, meaning that he interprets the Muslim culture in a negative light in all aspects: art, government, literature, etc. He also gives the ancient Indian culture credit for much of the mythology of Greece, Persia, and Judaism. These are provocative findings if true. However, he does not provide any footnotes or endnotes to support them. This continues throughout the book. And finally, the organization of the book is poor. With only three very small maps in a book of over 300 pages, one is not left with a very good understanding of the ebb and flow of the various cultures and kingdoms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Windows to the Light","review":"Delightful.

They're amazing concertos of outstanding emotion. The violin concerto starts out with such a tender and nostalgic theme, you'll have to fight back tears. Its a joy to listen to.The second movement is similar, but the third movment takes a turn towards virtuosity and syncopated rythems that keep you on the edge of your seat and give a satisfying contrast after two sweet, emotional movements.The Cello Concerto shows a darker side of the composer,but no less lyrical. This piece isnt so much sad, but more passionate with a kind of mystierouis quality about it. The Piano concerto is the least lyrical out of the three. Its more angular and modern sounding,esspecially in the finale where the time signature is the irregular 5/4. But in no way is it less great than the other 2 concertos.

It takes quite a lot of strength to pull that ladybug down. Then, after a few months either the ladybug starts to come off of the lever or the lever no longer goes all the way to the bottom, making it impossible to erase part of the screen. And the whole ladybug eraser mechanism is really loud and annoying. The animals aren't magnetized to the top, they kind of snap in and out. So, as others have said, they go from being hard to get out to falling out too easily. We also have the Fisher Price Doodle Pro. The shapes on that slide into the side, keeping them from getting lost. It's really easy to erase, and the screen looks better--whiter and the black shows up better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Shopping","review":"I wasn't impressed with this product and feel there are definately better ones out there.

Less than one month after purchase, the magnetic field no longer erases. The ladybug still moves with sound, which my son loves, but he can't do anything with it now because the screen stopped erasing. I put trust in my purchase because of the \\"Parents' Magazine\\" name.....I am very disappointed now! Don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"As other reviewers said, the toy is disappointing. On the surface it appears very cute, but is very hard to erase (even for an adult!) My greatest disappointment was in the terrible noise it makes when the mechanical eraser creeps back up on its own. (You can't test this out before you buy because of the plastic covering, so the buyer has no idea). I've been trying to find toys for my son that aren't so noisy and was very upset at this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not kid-friendly","review":"I totally agree with the other reviews. We received this as a gift. My 18 month old loves drawing on it - but he cannot clear the screen or get the stampers out. My 4 year old can barely clear the screen! Our Magnadoodle and Doodle Pro work great.

We received it as a gift and it was immediately rejected by her. The lever to pull to erase your drawings can't be pulled by her and I have to use a lot of effort to pull myself. Once you pull the lever to the bottom it automatically creeps back up itself; so it makes a mechanical noise which scares her. Then the cute animals at the top which makes shapes can't be easily gotten out and once they are out she can't \\"snap\\" them back in so if she carries her drawing somewhere all the little animals fall out. And last, the connecting string to the pen just reaches the edges. If your child can actually draw with the pen up straight then you will have no problem:) Even though this one was recommended for a younger age than some of the Fisher Price ones, it isn't worth it. The intention is great, but fails to work for an 18 month old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady bug is even hard for me!!!","review":"Just purchased this for my 2.5 year old for Christmas.

I agree with others that the ladybug \\"eraser\\" is too difficult for a young 2 year old child to operate. The ladybug is operated by pulling it down to the bottom of the board. The ladybug then retracts with such force that it will catch anything in its way - particularly little fingers. My 4 year old child had a painful pinch injury while playing with this toy. We have since taken the toy away from the kids.Other issues with this toy - there is a very loud noise generated by the \\"ladybug eraser.\\" And the animal magnets are not housed very securely at the top of the unit.I would strongly recommend that you make another purchase until the company decides to un-mechanize the \\"ladybug eraser.\\" Until then, this toy is a potential hazard to children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"I bought this for my 18-month-old niece for Christmas as it *looked* sturdier and more toddler-friendly than other magnetic doodle boards, and I trusted the Parent's Magazine brand name - that'll teach me not to deviate again from my usual practice of checking the customer reviews here first. As others have reported, the ladybug \\"eraser\\" is difficult for even an adult to pull, and makes a terrible grinding noise when released. I'd try the advice given below about removing a gear to fix this flaw, but since the board has already lost most of its magnetic function after less than a month there's really not much point. I'm disappointed that Parent's Magazine would give their name to such an inferior product, but after other recent bad experiences with the \\"second generation\\" of their toy cell phones (with the multicolored print exterior as opposed to the original solid red or black versions) I suppose I shouldn't be too surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kid's loved it, while it lasted.","review":"The kids really liked this from the start. They got it at their first birthday (twins.) But they could not use it independently and still can't at 2. They can't get the ladybug to erase. It is hard even for me. They can't always get the puzzle pieces out. But the deal breaker was that it lost its ability to stay magnatized after just a couple of months of use. The lines just fade away in seconds. I guess it is good, though. Then they don't have to bring it to me to erase! They used it for a while dispite, but now the lines they draw don't even show up at all. I think I might get them a regular magnadoodle this year because they liked it so much at the start.

I was standing in the store looking at two of them and chose this one over the other because of the brand. However, I am very disappointed with it, primarily because of how light (vs. dark) the writing/drawing appears on the screen. Not only is the color very light, it also erases very easily (even without using the ladybug eraser).

My 20 month old twins love drawing on it but they have to come to me to erase it. There is simply no way they could master it themselves.

They are not in stock now but after playing with it for over two years I would like another one to keep on hand at my house. I hope they become available soon because I would also like to buy two more for my new granddaughters. There is no mess to clean up and the stamps on the top are great to help draw into the pictures.

The only thing that made this EP worth two stars is that they cleaned up a lot of the rough edges from Baldurs Gate, and increased Experience points to a point where your fighter and like one other class can go up a level.

I took a month off from the track to study this book. When I returned, my play was much improved. While Modern Pace Handicapping is not the path to instant riches, it certainly points the way to more success. My most satisfying success so far was on Breeder's Cup Day, 2002. By using Brohamer's pace numbers, I saw that Volponi was a better horse than the experts were giving him credit for, and I bet him to win the Breeder's Cup Classic. He won at 43-1, and paid $89. Not bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for serious handicapper.","review":"If you want be a winning horseplayer you need an understanding of pace.

Sure it may use the official rules, but this game seems to run as slowly on my PIV 1.3g as it does on my PII 300m. What's up with that? I'm sure Interplay would blame it on both my hardware configurations.Further, I love role playing games as much as the next guy, but why do these people say they're going to use the official rules, and then try to make this game seem like a real-time game. The game is turn-based. Why not leave it at that? You can hit the attack button all you want in Baldur's Gate, but you never know when you're character will actually attack. Am I missing something or does everyone else writing reviews for this game work for Interplay?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reality Check","review":"Let's be serious. The idea of a good computer game from TSR is enough to make any D&D fan take notice, and they came SO close. But they failed in the most important part of it all. D&D is all about interacting with other players, and the multiplayer aspect of the game is simply terrible. It's impossible to do anything if you are not the main character, (the idea that there would even be a main character in a D&D game is insulting to all the players of the real game,) because whatever he does screws up whatever you are trying to do, even if you're not even on the same screen. It's not fun to follow someone else around the screen. Single player play is fair, but again, its all about playing with other people.

Just thought I'd chime in with the chorus. This is the MOST ADDICTIVE computer game I have ever played (and I've been playing them since you had to spend hours typing in code from magazines to play simple DOS text only games). I don't get into to the shoot-um-up games; I like story line and puzzles to solve, etc, so I usually play adventure games. I played D&D years ago and so enjoyed a return to the RPG format when I received this game as a gift. It's the best of all worlds. The Tales of the Sword Coast pack adds more depth and challenge - puzzles and better side quests. Some parts of the game do move too slow and the monsters tend to get more numerous rather than more complex as you go through. My only complaint is the abrupt ending. You finally get through this horrible battle and the game just stops. You can't even plunder the bodies much less have closer to the quest. All-in-all its worth the money and the hours-upon-months you'll spend playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best hack-and-slash RPGs ever","review":"As I mentioned in the summary, this game is in the grand style of RPGs, and it even manages to sneak a not embarrassing story line too. The gameplay is a good execution of more-or-less real time, and the mechanics are classic D&D. The main character is customizable, and he/she will meet many other kindred souls who can join you. With the numerous side quests, wide variety of supporting characters, and well-balanced selection of magical trinkets and critters, this game is, I believe, the standard for RPGs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldur's Gate","review":"A lot of fun for RPG players. The graphics are a little dated, but that doesn't really detract from the total story of the game. In fact, story is the key point of the game and it has a lot of it, enough to keep any player busy for hours.

If you're into exploring a realm and discovering it's secrets then THIS IS IT. The multiple choice dialog approaches real Role-playing. Rules, items, character classes, etc, come directly from AD&D.As the main character in the story, you've got a series of tasks to complete. These major plot sequences help you discover your hidden past and possible future. Many minor sub-plots fill the story out with lots of flavor. The outcome of some encounters depend upon your characteristics or maybe who's in your party with you.Magic, weapons, items, strategy, diplomacy, tactics, personality... it's all there. This software is very true to it's genre. I can't wait for the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent game!","review":"After this game I played Diablo.Diablo is not a bad game,but Baldur's Gate makes it look like Pong.This is the best AD&D game iv've ever played (and I play a lot).Baldur's Gate is about a kid (played by you) who grows up in Candle keep,under the kind tutelage of his foster father,Gorion.After a couple of years growing up,Gorion wants to move away.You don't know why.In about 20 minutes into the game (that's how long it took me)Gorion gets killed in a horrid battle by mercenaries.You must avenge him.But,after traveling and making friends (and making enemies),you find out your dark secret.Very addictive game.Yet the computer was going through hell.That's the only problem.Buy this if you liked Lotr!(Lord of the Rings)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAY BE A GOOD GAME BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW","review":"When I received this game I opened it up and right away started installing it, but wait in all the excitement i didn't notice it being in the cardboard CD holder and because it was the installation wouldnt work why?

I was wrong I only got to the mines (one of the first levels) and kept dying. This game has a good story and characters but it takes forever to grow a level (get stronger) and the levels are close to impossible. If you want a real RPG get Diablo 2 it has great multiplayer and loads of fun. Or for those of you that cant play M rated games you should get Final Fantasy 7.

Even with the patch, it crashes constantly. Everytime I am just starting to get the hang of the controls, it locks up and shuts down, (usually right before I am about to save my progress).

I looked at the screenshots, I read the reviews, but I didn't think the game was for me. I was into shooters...I couln't be bothered with these so called R-P-G's. Then the price dropped below 20...and my computer gaming was never the same. This is by far one of the best computer rpg's that i ever played. The character options were so vast...the companions were plentiful, and the weapons were totally awesome. I spent a good 60+ hours with this game, and even then, once I was finished...I started another character and played it again. No other game had that kind of power over me. If you still haven't played this game...get it now. There are even user-made upgrades that improve the graphics if you have the sequel. This is one game that should be in everyone's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tip Your Hats","review":"I have been a gamer ever since I could think enough to be one, and Baldur's gate is quite possibly the very best game in the world today. To be a proper PC gamer, you have to be one who cares not about graphics, or animation stylings, but storyline. A true PC gamer sees the true worth of a game in the emotion which you percieve in playing it, and the true feeling of joy in the playing. GAMING SHOULD NEVER BE A CHORE. That is the thought of a true PC gamer. And this game is a wonder of the PC world. Of all the 30+ pc games, 5 xbox games and 15 gamecube games that I own, few have even begun to give me the same feeling as this, and none have ever completed it. Though this game might not be a graphical wonder, it is a 2-d world that is still more beautiful than any 3-d attempt. This game is bursting with replay value, and is never a bore or a trouble to play. It is my greatest game of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for RPG fans","review":"The best fantasy CRPG I've played since I got Realmz for the Macintosh (from Fantasoft- check it out, all Mac fans) It had a few annoying bugs but this probably had more to do with my cobbled-together $300 PC than the Software.

The game is by first of its kind. It is the first game with the DND name to be in 3D. But what makes the game so special is its fantastic story line. The story is brilliantly thought up and flows wonderfully. The game also has very real NPC's with actual backround stories and everything. The game also has hundreds of monsters to fight and even more things to throw at them, including spells and numerous weapons. This is a great game for even those who have never even played Dungeons and Dragons before and I highly recomend it to anyone with any intrest in roleplaying whatsoever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic start...","review":"This game is a fantastic start to a very enjoyable (and long) saga...that of the Bhaalchild traversing Faerun, ever pursued by his/her destiny.The game is highly enjoyable and the graphics and gaming engine are superb.However, the game loses much of its fire after its sequel is sampled. Shadows of Amn is even better, and the improvements are very tangible as everything is heavily complexified and the game becomes more challenging and engaging. I advise that gamers play this game to see if they enjoy the setup and type of game, and then delve into the far richer Shadows of Amn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game that started the legend","review":"Already has all the elements that will make bg series such an absolute game.

I was planning on using it to run my drill press and was most interested in it because I thought that it could switch off more quickly than the two push buttons on the drill press itself. No matter how careful you are drill presses occasionly grab the work piece and fling it and I wanted a way to get away from the press and switch it off as quickly as possible. I was expecting the foot switch to work like a deadman switch where the instant I took pressure off the foot controlling it the circuit would be broken and the drill press would stop. Instead, this switch, once acitivated by momentary foot pressure, stays on by itself until you hit the foot pedal again.

But the real focus of the book (or at least Lyle's attention) is off-the-field - especially the interaction with Yankee owner George Steinbrenner and Lyle's demands to salvage his professional honor and career. In a sort of sad post-script Lyle got his wish and was traded to the Rangers, yet never reattained the form that made him the Cy Young winner in 1977."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book That Started My Love For Non Fiction Books","review":"What can I say?

Now I know why. Although there are some entertaining parts in general the book is only average as a written work and the content, as one reviewer noted, is first person whiny. Sparky Lyle should have stuck to pitching and focused more on being a competitor. The book is filled with contradictions as he relates hsi values as an athelete.

All the sabertooth cats do is move from one scene to the next, slaughtering an amazing amount of people along the way. There's no personality to these cats that makes them realistic, or makes them scary. Is you want an idea of how this book should've turned out, read \\"Ghosts of Tsavo\\" by Philip Caputo, which is a non-fiction account of man-eating lions in Africa. Now that's scary.If Rovin just stuck to a more realistic picture of his monsters, this could've been a far more thrilling work.

The author apparently hasn't studied the very real oppression of women during earlier time periods in history. This is junk social science, and, horrifically has been given credibility it does not deserve. Admittedly, the premise is unique. The 'academics' behind the premise, however, are weak at best, and downright dangerous at worst. Connections are drawn with no grounds other than the author's personal claim that various advances in industry or science are related to anti-faminist attitudes and have sexual undertones.If you like this book, you'll love the equally distorted sexual references in Spinning Straw Into Gold (by Gould)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring ad nauseum","review":"This is, without a doubt, the most boring book I've ever read.

The dance instructor has such a heavy accent, it's near impossible to understand her. What WAS understood wasn't spoken loud enough, my tv was at top volume. She is not upbeat at all and acts like she wasn't paid enought to make this video. Her attitude and tone of voice is all the same- dull. I am annoyed at amazon for recommending this.

I would not recommend this tape.I ordered two tapes.

I stuck it out and after finishing it I decided I really did not like it. I feel as though I was reading two entirely different books - one that was a supernatural Stephen Kingesque novel and one that was a coming of age chiller/thriller novel. Frankly I didn't \\"get\\" all the Parson character/Devil stuff.

I can hardly wait to see who in my book club got through it and what they thought of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is one of my most favorite books. Phillips is brilliant with language and tone, in the tradition of such Southern authors as Faulkner and Styron. She really makes you feel hot and sweaty as she describes the summer in West Virginia, and she does a wonderful job at placing you inside the minds of these children, all who are hurt and disturbed to varying degrees, but still ultimately triumph over evil.I love books such as this one who tell a good story but in a non-linear way, and give you credit for having a brain to figure things out that are implied rather than thrown at you. If you want that you can read King or Grisham, but I'll take Jayne Anne any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and Slow","review":"Did Phillips even know what she wanted to write about when she started this book? She sets up an interesting situation and then proceeds to waste time with verbal gymnastics. What little plot there is is completely disjointed and moves at a snail's pace. There is no connection, no growth, no logic between the opening and closing of the novel. Furthermore, the characters are flat, unbelievable, and rather dull. Phillips introduces themes of violence, religion, sexuality, and family and never develops or connects a single one of them. At the close of the book the reader is confused, not because of the depth or range of Phillips' writing, but because the author herself was clearly confused as she wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeless \\"Shelter\\"","review":"After having tried on three separate occasions to work my way through this book, I am left with one question: how many trees were sacrificed to satisfy the author's need to spew self-titillating and turgid offal?

Once you get to know the people in the book, you don't even have to read the title of the chapter to know who is talking. She writes from the perspective of Lenny and Alma, two sisters at camp, Buddy, a small boy who follows them around, and Parson who lives in a shack near the camp. Throughout the story they are beautifully linked together.

The problem is that the cards are cardboard so the letters just fall right off. They could have at least lined the slots for the letters with metal if they wanted to keep the cards made out of cardboard to save money.That said, it gets played with almost every day, and my daughter really enjoys just taking the letters and the cards out and putting them back in again, and everything has held up incredibly well.

Author Tom Bisio comes to his knowledge not just through hard work and training, but via real life experience as a martial arts competitor and teacher. Bisio breaks down treatment into its essential, practical components which allows for coaches, instructors and competitors to actually use the information that he has to share in real time. He explains in depth why the early, proper treatment of injuries can save an athlete or martial artist from a lifetime of pain and struggle. And he does it in a no-nonsense, practical way that removes the cloak of mystery from Chinese medicine and reveals it as the practical, age-old science that it truly is.A great, in depth book that anyone who has even a remote chance of being injured should have readily at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than I Expected","review":"I'm hampered by a connective tissue disorder named ELS and so I searched high and low for remedies for \\"sinew or soft tissue injuries\\" online.

Bruises that go away in half the time, a run in with a deck board across the bridge of my nose that healed in 5 days! (Hit/Fall wine and medicated pearl powder).

I certainly believe Western medicine has its place, but Western doctors were worse than useless to me in this case. The exercises in this book have been instrumental in getting me back on the mat again, and in putting my body back in balance so I don't risk such an injury again. It's also a great resource to have in the dojo for first aid--over the years I have seen bits and pieces of the stuff in this book used by various teachers (e.g. cupping, moxibustion, plasters), and having it all together in one handy volume is priceless. I'm so grateful to Tom Bisio for creating this book--and for helping me put myself back together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real treasure!","review":"I bought this book since I wanted something to guide me in treating my own sports injuries. I did not know how informative it really is considering its low price. Since trying several of the remedies on myself, I have also treated friends' injuries as well. It is a true treasure of information on Chinese medicine that everyone should know, or at least have access to in this day and age. I have had much better success with these remedies and prevention methods than with typical \\"Western\\" treatments such as \\"R.I.C.E\\". Of course I will always rely on X-Rays and other Western diagnostic methods, but I find this book to be a great way to blend the benefits of both Western and Eastern medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction and \\"one-stop\\" reference ...","review":"Tom Bisio has put together a concise, but comprehensive overview of martial arts medicine from the traditional Chinese perspective - a veritable goldmine of information that can be applied to the needs of anyone who's engaged in any kind of sport or performance activity.

If you hair is medium brown, use the medium brown color, it is an exact match. I also recommend reading reviews before purchasing any product. Oh, and the price for this product is very reasonable. The salon where I get my hair done recently started carrying hair mascara and their price is $24.00. Buy online!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cover your gray review","review":"color is good and true to the packagingproduct feels a little greasy at firstbut blends in well with little effort"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not match medium brown hair","review":"I ordered this product before and loved it. This time, however, the color doesn't match my hair - it seems to have an obvious red tint and really doesn't look brown. It also made my hair look greasy where I applied it. I wonder if they changed something about this product because it matched well the first time I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energetic and Inspiring","review":"This DVD of Beethoven's Missa Solemnis is dramatic, well sung and, especially, well conducted. Von Karajan's conducting is masterful and powerful. What he is able to do with the orchestra is superb. His is an energetic and inspiring reading of this monumental work.

It was sharp and quick.But now the wheel will barely move. Additionally, the clear material that makes up the wheel is disintegrating, \\"rubbing-up\\" the way rubber glue does. The is no apparent way to take the mouse apart to see if there is a way to free up the wheel.I can't believe that this technology is being made useless because of something as simple as the poor design quality of the wheel. And because of that, the mouse, charger, and USB receiver are headed to the landfill after a very short life. What a waste of resources."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfort with a cost","review":"This mouse has a very comfortable feel to it but does come at a price. The mouse is indeed rechargeable but when you need to recharge, it begins to be very annoying when the mouse will not sit on the docking bay right and charge right. It is also very difficult to keep it charged because any movement where the mouse is plugged in at will know it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I should have listened to one of the other reviewers regarding this item. At first I was pleased because I have big hands and this is the first wireless mouse I've ever used that feels ergonomically correct. However, all the pros of this mouse are immediately negated due to the fact that it refuses to seat correctly in the charging pad. Very poor design. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recharging cradle doesn't work","review":"This would be a good product if it didn't fail at the recharging. The cradle portion is so poorly designed the mouse recharging contacts can't maintain contact with the cradle contacts. This prevents the mouse from recharging. The recharging option was one of the main reasons for getting the mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"As others have stated, this mouse is difficult to charge as it does not sit correctly on the charger. Worse, it does not hold a charge for very long so if you don't constantly recharge it, it dies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saw, fence flex","review":"This saw has proven to be wonderful so far. It was relatively easy to assemble with pictures augmenting the assembly manual. Some of the steps weren't as clear as they should have been, such as missing the mention of when to use a washer. An exploded view would better show how some of the pieces are to fit together. I was impressed with how the motor attached, using pins, that made it a lot easier to hold in one hand while trying to attach it to the base. I agree with previous reviewer about the far end of the fence deflecting slightly under pressure. It seems as if this may be remedied by spacing the opposite flange out with a washer. The fence is still smooth and accurate though. This saw is very quiet compared to the direct drive models."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got caught by a bargain","review":"This was a lot of saw for the money so I dove in. Had it a month, used it twice, the fence broke where it clamps to the rail. Bought a 50 inch fence that doesn't shift an eighth to the right when set. Running with dado blades, saw stopped. Wasn't motor. The arbor seized up. Could spin it backwards but not forwards. It tightened like a screw. Maybe there's something I don't know but it seems that that is one thing a table saw should never ever ever do. Unimpressed and worried what's next. Should have spent the extra for the 2hp General."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Saw-Terrible Fence","review":"I purchased this saw because it looked like a good saw for my money. Assembly was a breeze as well as alignment. Saw cut extremely smooth until one day the locking handle broke on the fence. Apparently it is made of a very poor quality Chinese cast metal. Upon calling for a warranty replacement I was informed that it would be at least six weeks before I could get a new one. That is not what a professional woodworker likes to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent prosumer saw","review":"Overall a great saw at it's price. I've ripped 2\\" thick red oak on it and it didn't break a sweat. It's steady without having to anchor it to the floor and once you calibrate the fence, cuts are dead on.My complaints are exactly the same as ones already stated here. Fence tip deflects, it looks really bad when your feeding the material, but the cuts always come out true so I guess it does not deflect where it matters. The guard and splitter are junk. I tried to be good and use them for a while, but all they do is jam and get in the way.If you've got a small shop, get the optional wheel kit. It's hard to find, but worth it when it's time to clean up and move the minivan back in the garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is one of my favorite. It does a good job of showing that God's general revelation to man exists in many cultures independently. The evidence is compelling. My conclusion is that the notion and understanding of God is something that transcends culture in general. It must not be the case that the notion of a monotheistic God developed out of any single culture, but rather is shown to exist in many independent cultures. Now, God's special revelation seems to have been communicated through a specific culture(s). However, God's general revelation seems to be independent of culture, which is what we would expect from the reality of God. The evidence tells me that God isn't something made up in our minds. Rather, God is a reality that has an affect on our minds and being. This is consistent with a God that transcends culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Stories","review":"The book had many amazing stories related to people all around the world who testify to a belief in a God that they do not know but seek an yearn to know.

Rarely can we know how God might have prepared our neighbor for His message if only we will be faithful to be His servant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book covering certain historical around that which is recorded in scripture that provide corroberative evidence to the truth of scripture."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah we like this one","review":"this book is well written and I really enjoyed it.This book compares weird tribal religions, myths, ancient and modern cultures with the teachings of the Holy bible. The author puts up a very convincing arguement that the God of the bible has influenced and guided thier beliefs so that when the Gospel finally reached these cultures it would have a fertile soil.As a young Christian this book blew my mind, It was this that caused for the first time a gaping awe of the gnarlyness, power and wisdom of god. some times It had me in tears of joy, sometimes singing and praising God at rush hour in buchanan street bus station (Glasgow).This book Rocks and if anyone was thinking of buying this book I would say \\"do it\\", infact if they were unsure and I had the cash I'd buy it for them, (sadly I dont)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought this book because of the reviews. . . .","review":"and I wasn't disappointed.This book is a truly fascinating read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eternity in their hearts","review":"My son read this book for a book club.

Overall, he is very glad he read the book and would strongly recommend that everyone else read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provacative View of the Vietnam War","review":"Michael Lind would seem like an unusual person to reinterpret the titanic struggle over Vietnam. He is a writer, poet and left-of-center journalist who feels that despite the enormous cost in lives and material and the deep flaws in American policy, the war still served a purpose. Lind views the war as part of the Cold War and feels that we were sure to lose some battles in the fifty-year campaign to contain Communism. He divides the war into two distinct phases, an overwhelmingly guerilla insurgency in the years before 1968's Tet Offensive, and a more conventional, territorial land war that began after Tet. Lind believes that the strategy employed in the first phase was horribly misguided, and that afterwards, Congress and the American people had lost faith in the entire sorry affair. The Necessary War is a well-argues polemic that challenges conventional wisdom."},{"rating":"1","title":"History written by a loser.","review":"From Lind, verbatim: \\"Who won and who lost the Vietnam War?

I am a college student taking a Vietnam Era class and I have read many books and documents on the different aspects of the Vietnam War most of which are excellent but this by far is absolute junk. The only reason I finished the book was because I had a research paper to do. This book make conjectures that are so far fetched that you can not even argue them because you are too busy scratching you head. A big one that stands out is when he says that the domino theory is not real but then gives you his own version of the domino theory and calls it the \\"Bandwagon Theory.\\" It is astonishing that this book is still printed.

He wanted roles to show his range as an actor. Abbott said, \\"Call me when you're ready to get back together.\\" Costello never called. He probably wished he would have. His last movie, his only starring film without Abbott, is an embarrassment. You can almost read Costello's mind' \\"what am I doing in this piece of junk? \\" Poor Lou doesn't get a laugh in the whole film and he just looks sad and lost. He used to be able to sell an audience the most ridiculous situations. In this, he can't even sell walking down the street. Costello never lived to see the premiere.

Pappano's experience with operatic works is evident in each work, masterfully building up drama and intensity, for example in R&J Overture and Francesca. 1812 Overture's choral part has lovely subtlety as well as glorious sonority. Only drawback is that the finale is rather flat, with all percussion instruments muffled in the background, and bass drums are used instead of real artillery. Ormandy (choral version) and Solti's recordings of the work is far more powerful and exhilarating."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY old software","review":"Could not get it to work on a Windows XP box.

The only reason I don't give it a five star is that it's not for the vast majority of readers. It's about an extremely insular and bizarre group of bricklayers living in an isolated town in England.

The folk stuff is almost pathetic (but still good for a laugh), although the opener \\"Ruby Red\\" is a fantastic piece of morose mock-folk. \\"In My Shadow\\" is wierd, and comes and goes much too quickly.

I like how it has a speedometer at the top of the pedal, and how it has a shifter, something the official Microsoft Wheel doesn't have.It doesn't have a huge deadzone as other reviews say, in fact it is very precise. It works excellent in the two games I have for XBOX 360, Midnight Club: Los Angeles and Forza Motorsport 2. If you know anything about racing games, you will know these games are on different ends of the realism spectrum. This is where the steering wheel's built in sensitvity settings come into play. The only complaint I have about this wheel is the suction cups are terrible. I've tried it on multiple surfaces, including glass, wood, and marble. On all these surfaces, it sticks for a few seconds and then lifts off when you move the wheel a little bit. To fix this problem, I went to the local craft store and bought new suction cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. Read a glowing review.

(one complaint: too centered on the English-speaking world) Convincing arguments that Charles I had everything going right for him, that the American Revolution was a sheer fluke that almost nobody wanted, that Britain should have allowed Germany to win the First World War, and that the Soviet state still had many decades of life ahead of it when Gorbachev arrived, are presented with gusto. Other essays are not really counterfactual at all, and should not have been included.

The only problem I find is the uneven quality of the essays. The best by far is Ferguson's paper on the First World War. Some essays are almost boring. The essay on Nazi England is just an overview of the people who would be sympathetic to or aligned with the Nazis. It does not provide any interesting arguments.

I'll never EVER buy Baby Trend again (I had a BT stroller and the wheel won't stop squeaking)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well constructed","review":"My mother bought me this bassinet/pack and play for my 2nd born. I have used many versions of the pack in play (I have a 5 year old as well) and have to say that I thought the Baby Trend version was really aweful.When we were putting it together the first time, we noticed the vibration mechanism did not work. I calld baby trend and they sent me a new one, no questions asked. THe replacement broke after 3 months with VERY lite use. The Matress is also oorly contructed. Before my baby reached the weight maximum of the bassinet attachment, it started to bow in the middle. Also, the \\"slats\\" that make up the matress do not seem to stay put and end up overlapping. This tends to make it rather uncomfortable for baby. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I have use GRaco pack in plays in the past and wished I had gotten one of those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way to clean it!","review":"My son is 6 months old now and we have used this product since he was born. It is beautiful and has wonderful features, but there's no way to clean the changing table or the mat that's used for the bassinet/play pen pad. It has been great for diaper changes and naps downstairs. We noticed when it got dirty the first time that the pad on the bottom was not able to be washed because it has what feels like cardboard inside and there is no way to remove the cover. The changing table attachment wipes down easily, but the fabric around and the straps are not removable. I was hoping to use this again when we plan to have more children, but I think I will have to buy another one. I just don't feel comfortable with being able to only spot clean everything! It really is beautiful, but why would anyone make anything for a baby that you cannot wash!? If anyone has found a way to clean this, please let me know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"im due in march of 06 and got this playpen as a babyshower gift i loved the colors (green and blue) since it matched the babys room..but putting this thing together was the hardest part it took my husband around a hour to put it up and there was parts missing like the battery door and the things that clip the organizer to the playpen..and i dont see how this thing can be considered portable?? with our 2 year old son we had bought the clarion graco playpen its similar to the colver one and i loved it.. it only took 1 min flat to put up..and never had a problem"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just registered for this product....","review":"I don't actually own this product yet, but registered for it yesterday.

They instructed me to pack up the playpen and return it to the store for a new one.Not wanting to risk getting another lemon I purchesed the Laura Ashley Pack and Play - it was more money but it was well worth not having to deal with the hassel this item gave me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Center, HOWEVER....","review":"This is a very nice Center. THe colors are very light and soothing. I bought it for my daughter and eventhough it has blue in it the colors mesh nicely with white, baby blue and seafoam green.

I enjoy the containers that fit in the front of the unit they hold baby diapers, powder and other accessories.he only BUT for this product is the SET-UP...it was a bit difficult for my husband and I to set up, in fact it took so long that we haven't taken it apart yet to travel anywhere. My mother bought the POrtable Pack 'N play yard for her house and it is a lot easier to set up and take down! but for the one time set up in my livingroom it is a perfect place for my baby to rest when we want a change of scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"So far I'm frustrated!","review":"I just spent the longest time trying to put this thing together. The instructions were put together terribly and I spent about half an hour trying to find Figure 4 until I realized they made a typo and wrote it as Figure 5. My hands and whole body are sore from putting it together and I had to redo the instructions a few times before I could get it right. Only now am I reading the reviews and see that many people have the same complaint. Wish at this point, even though it is so cute, that I would have gotten something different. I even have to go back to the store to look and make sure I assembled it correctly. BAD INSTRUCTIONS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"Overall I really like this product. When I first got it, it was a little difficult to set it up. However, now I have no problems at all setting the pack-n-play up. I love most of the features that it came with. The music and vibration were things that I never used because the music was too loud and the vibration wasn't powerful enough. I did really like the light that it came with. It came in very handy when she was nursing late at night. The first time I tried to fold this thing up to take on a trip it took me hours to get it folded up small enough to get into the bag. The rails would not bend tight enough to fold it, but with much work I finally got it to work for me. Also, I agree with one of the other comments about the bag not being big enough to fit all of the accessories in. As a whole I think this is a great product, and I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for two story homes","review":"We live in a two story home and this playard is perfect for downstairs. Instead of going upstairs everytime baby needs to be changed or sleep, everything that is needed is available downstairs in the playard.

The changing table and iPod hookup is what got me. The bonus is the storage area for diapers, wipes, powder, pacifers, rattles. Plus there's an additional pocket on one side. The negatives of this item is that the frame is a bit too wide to fit through standard doorways, so you need to partially collapse it to get from one room to another. Also I was hoping to be able to transport this for the 'grandparents'; however it is too heavy to take apart and put together regularly. Both sets ended up purchasing smaller pack n' plays for their homes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots To Offer","review":"This is a really neat product, but it is NOT easy to assemble - the instructions are pretty skeletal and pictures are not very useful.

What a horror show. It does not stay together, keeps falling apart, so flimsy a pokemon figure causes it to topple over, pieces of it all over the toy room. It is expensive and really, just an utter piece of junk. What were they thinking when they made this? Did they not test it out? Anyone can plainly see how useless it is.

My 6-year-old son decided to spend his birthday money on this Pokemon toy. Despite our unsuccessful efforts to talk him out of it, he insisted this was what he wanted and it came home with us. Oh brother, what a piece of junk. Very flimsy plastic pieces that don't securely fasten together, poor instructions and one Pokemon rubber toy is what you get. Of course, it looks impressive on the box, but once it's together (loosely-fitted together, that is), you have a poorly designed, poorly made toy. You also get a cardboard cutout of a Pokemon hospital that you fold together (woo hoo) and some cardboard backing that requires using your own tape to secure to the back of the toy. Only one thing was no surprise in this surprisingly bad toy: our 6-year-old becoming bored with it in a couple days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Piece of Garbage","review":"I purchased one month ago from Toy's R US.

The expected romantic misunderstandings take place with neither party revealing their feelings until the end after they have saved Catherine's brother with a little high seas action in the process.Not bad as young adult romances go, the continued enforced guilt of Derrick got a little old after a while. Yes, he'd been a pirate once, but get over it. Catherine was your typical perfect heroine, pretty and brave and stubborn, with little personality.While the book was the usual fair from this genre, it was a good effort and more enjoyable than most which is why it got a higher rating than I would normally give.

They are light-weight, though. So together with the bad sound you won't notice when they fall off and you step on them - no difference either way. I also doubt that they are \\"sweatproof\\", as only the rubber pieces that touch the ear are \\"washable\\" with a wet washcloth - the actual drivers have large openings where sweat will run in (yuck).

Oh, good lord, why did I continue reading this book? When she finally decides to kiss him, he becomes a live man and the rest of the book is made up of her pretending to be sassy and independent, but then caving in to his demands the minute he gets forceful. The storyline is very predictable, with her brothers getting all stupid and protective over her even though she's supposedly A Woman of Independent Mind. Ugh. I guess I should have listened to my spidey sense when it started tingling & taken this book back to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open for improvement","review":"I've enjoyed other stories by this author but this was definitely not one of them. I researched and found out that this was her first published story. Reviewed by others, I can only tell you why I didn't care for THE STONE PRINCE: Katie and Jorlan were shallow and confusing. The story made very little sense though I thought the idea was a novel one.With very little chemistry between any of the characters I think there are much better books to read than spending your time with this one.

You have the male lead who's basically \\"I male. You female. Have sex\\" and the lead female who tries to convince everyone she's strong and independent but succumbs to his every whim. One reveiwer wrote that she's \\"tough as nails\\" I believe, but I just couldn't see it!

The presentation of life on a whaling ship is far removed from the realities of whaling ships, according to history, but that's what literary or cinematic romance is all about.I agree with the U.K. reviewer regarding Betta St. John as the native girl.I find many MGM films from the early 50s to be notoriously dull, but \\"All the Brothers Were Valiant\\" is escapist entertainment at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best Star Trek game ever","review":"Fun puzzles, great voice acting, great lip-synching, and most emportantly -- REALLY GOOD WRITING.

In Browne's book, he claims to be an expert about a lifestyle he knows little to nothing about. He discriminates against other sports, offering poor examples and support for his arguments.

Maybe he should do some research into a broad range of sports instead of focussing on skateboarding and beating it like a dead horse. I would rather watch TV than buy this book.

Much of the negative reaction to it seems to result from comparing it to de Bernieres's earlier works. One of my favorite authors, a Scot named George Mackay Brown, wrote lyrical, serious works set in the Orkney Islands of Scotland. He also wrote children's books about the tribulations of Fankle the cat. To criticize Fankle's misadventures in his household for lacking the depth of, say, a magical-real B/brown study on the nature of war, would be ridiculous. So it goes for some of the attacks on this book. It's fun, it's charming without being cloying, and, for all its probable embellishments, it goes a long way toward highlighting the life of a dog who clearly meant a lot to a lot of people."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie","review":"After seeing (and thoroughly enjoying) the movie I was excited to read the book to get a more in debth look at the characters. However at just 115 pages I don't feel like I got nearly as much from the book as I did from just seeing the movie. This is odd because it's usually the other way around.

It is great having music without bad words and beats that hurt your ears. Her instructions are easy to follow and she does not look like a tramp in her outfit. Many of the songs played inspires your soul as you are working on the body! Each segment focuses on a different area, so if you really want to work on one area, you can do it daily. I like the choice to vary the areas you work on! The main thing is, if you just want to walk, you can in any weather in the comfort of your own home! I highly recommend this video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"This is an excellent DVD workout. And I LOVE the cooking segment at the end of the DVD to guide on great ideas for breakfasts. It's so cool to see Leslie cooking! I also love that the DVD is broken up into five one-mile walks and they are a good workout for being one mile, especially if you're just starting out. Or you can do all five miles of workouts, one after another as you get stronger. Give it a try....I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better walking videos","review":"This video is quite good for a walk at home. Leslie is slightly annoying, but definitely not unbearable. There are 5 walks on the video which is nice to switch it up. There is a classic, 14 mins - arms, 14 mins - legs, 14 min - abs, 14 mins - fast walk, 12 mins. They all use a lot of the same moves, but they do emphasize what they say they will...except the abs could have been done a lot better. Over all a great video. They are short walks so you have time for them everyday and being able to switch it up keeps the boredom down. Great for beginners or if you are more advanced it is still a good pace and you can add your own twist if you need more of a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to stick with it!","review":"Finally I think I have found an exercise regimen that I can stick with! I am a very busy working mom of 3 and I have tried different DVD's and other work out routines (resistance bands, etc.) I really like this DVD because if you don't have a lot of time you can just do one mile. With the warm-up and cool-down included it takes a little over 20 min. and definitely gets my heart rate up! If you feel up to it you can keep going and do more miles, each mile has a different target area (arms, legs, etc.) For the price I would recommend giving this a try, especially if you have found it hard to stick to other work out routines or if you find it hard to fit exercise into your day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I was looking for a low impact video that I could do early in the morning before going to work. I have had back surgery (twice) and my surgeon said walking was the best thing to do. This video is just what I was looking for. I can customize my workout with any combination of 5 different 1 mile workouts. If I don't have much time, I can choose the fast paced 12 min. mile. If I have more time, I can choose 2 or more one mile workouts. I have been using this video almost every morning for about a month and I feel better, have more energy and more strength in my legs not to mention I have lost a few pounds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great exercise dvd","review":"Love this dvd, wish I had brought it first. I have other Leslie Sansone DVD but this one beats them all. It is a perfect starter in a collection of Leslie's dvd's. It takes you thru her routines step by step and the pace is slower. That way you can build up to the faster pace miles in some of her other DVD's. So if you are just starting out on a walk at home program make this your first of many dvd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"five mile walk","review":"This is a great work out video for someone who has not worked out for sometime. Due to my work schedule I never was very dedicated to working out and was very out of shape. Since I have retired i have a little more time to work out. I only do a mile a day but it really makes me work up a sweat and I feel it all over my body. I like the fact that it works on different areas of the body everyday. I highly recommend this work out even though it is not strenuous you can feel the difference it makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to the Leslie collection","review":"I recently rented this from Netflix to see if I'd like it. I do. It's great to be able to do any one of the five separate miles or combine two or more of them. Plus it has a separate warm up and cool down in the menu, so you can easily select what you want for the workout. I kind of miss the collection of \\"walkers\\" she has in the Walk Away the Pounds collection -- it's fun to watch the exercisers - helps to pass the time. But, as others have said, some of the quips and comments become a bit tedious after hearing them so many times. After reviewing this DVD and doing a couple of the workouts, I decided to buy it. It will be my 4th Leslie DVD (plus her yoga DVD), but that's o.k. It's good to vary them to keep motivated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leslie Sansone: 5 Day Slim Down - A Mile Each Morning","review":"Excellent 5 mile walk from Leslie! I have several other DVD's from her and this is one of the best. Very challenging with some great new moves added! Only drawback is that it takes 80 minutes to do the 5 mile walk with the warm-up and stretching.

Great addition to my work-out routine when I can commit that much time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 14 minute mile workout!","review":"Loved the routine, loved the pace, loved Leslie, she is very easy to follow, very encouraging and fun. I am doing one mile each morning before work and its exactly the amount of time I have to spend, but you can also do as many miles as you want, each routine is a little different and works different parts of the body, its not just walking!

Leslie Sansone's Walk At Home: 5 Day Slim Down - A mile for each morning offers something for each muscle group. I have been walking with Leslie for the past couple of weeks doing the warm up, classic walk and cool down. Now, I am walking two miles. I like that we can pick and choose which miles we want to do. Variety. I have always hated exercise and lacked motivation. Leslie is very encouraging and motivating with her bubbly personality. I enjoy walking with Leslie in the morning.

I have inflamation in the joints in my chest and a little scholiosis(probably not spelled right)in my neck, so floor excercises are uncomfortable for me. Maybe once I get stronger I can do the floor excersises, but now, this dvd is perfect for me. She is cheerful - I could see how any more and she would be annoying.

You can pick and choose what area you want to concentrate on each day and do as little or as much as you want.

I like the way you can pick a mile that targets certain areas of the body. I only gave this a 4 star because I really didn't care for the one on one with Leslie through out the whole video. There are no group participation. I know alot of people think that is so much better, feel it is more like a personal trainer, but I enjoyed watching the group better. I think with a group the time goes by much faster. That's only a personal opinon though. I still would have bought the video even if I would have known this. I do recommend this video to anyone. A piece of advice, but it from Amazon......best price and fast delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic workout","review":"I bought this because my VCR finally died and I could no longer do the 4 Leslie Sansone workouts I had and loved. This one wasn't bad although I do prefer when she has other people working out with her. This one was just a solo Leslie for all the miles. I didn't feel like the arms and stomach ones did much work on my arms or stomach. I did like the legs section. Overall though it's a good basic walking workout.

To me itjust doesn't make a good mix to hear smallchildren singing about grownup topics.- majority of the songs were non religious(obviously a matter of personal preference)A lot of people cited liking this out of nostalgia. I too remember fondly \\"All I want for Christmas was my 2 front teeth\\", however this rendition just didn't live up to my memories.If you want a lovely Christmas CD sung by children, look up\\"Frosty\\" on Amazon.

I would like to have seen more discussion of other languages, though (Scheme?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for anyone interested in Falconry!","review":"As a young falconer of 13 myself, I found this book extremly interesting, with a lot of useful information. The book covers every aspect of Falconry Management and Practise, from choosing the right bird for you, caring for and training of your bird, through to invaluable help on health problems (particularly how to avoid them!). Although the book is mainly aimed at Sparrow-Hawk Keepers, much of the content is universal to all birds of Prey Enthusiasts. Advice and Information on keeping Birds of Prey varies considerably from book to book and person to person, so it is always a good idea to read as many books as possible about the subject. You can then make up your own mind on which methods suit you. Other good books a have read on the subject include:- Falconry Art & Practice - Emma Fords O for a Falconers voice - Roger Upton Hakwing Ground Quarry - Martin Hollinshead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Construction","review":"The headphone jack is soldered directly to the circuit board.

If you already have previous versions of EndNote, e.g., 6.02, DO NOT upgrade. EndNote 8 is slow and unreliable and a waste of money. One area that I constantly run into trouble is the connection of EndNote to the PubMed server via the Internet. EndNote crashes frequently, and it seems to do so when Palm Desktop 4.2.1 is also running. If EndNote is finally connceted, it takes twice as long to download literatures as does v. 6.0.2. It is very frunstrating that new versions of the softwares do not aim at making themselves easy and reliable to use. Instead they add features that seem to benefit very few users.

The depiction of the teeth-baring, donkey-like, and definitely not cute pooka is quite sinister--I thought my 3 1/2 year old would be afraid of it, but she's in a bit of stage where she's intrigued by evil characters lately. The story itself isn't too scary, but in the end the moral basically seems to say that O'Rourke shouldn't have taken pity on the cold, hard-working pooka, that his one act of unselfishness backfires.

This is particularly alleged for his part at Gettysburg but visiously-so by a few of Longstreet's contemporaries after Lee, who never publicly made such charges, had died. So, the author challenges the reader to consider the effects of politics that followed the war and resulted in Longstreet's \\"tarnishment.\\" This book prompted me to read \\"Lee and Longstreet at High Tide\\" by Helen Longstreet, his second wife. With an obvious love-interest in preserving his reputation, she nevertheless makes very convincing and record-based arguments that basically support this book. I recommend her's as follow-up reading to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apologetics: Justifying the ways of Longstreet to man","review":"This book reads like the doctoral dissertation of a graduate student: copious footnotes carefully documenting statements, and a thesis with \\"point\\" to be made. The writing, however, is not bone dry like many academic endeavors are, and this book is nicely crafted. Longstreet probably alienated many people with his irascible nature, but I do think he was justified in saying the same things that Lee himself said about Gettysburg: the decision to make Pickett's Charge was Lee's, against Longstreet's advice, and Lee properly took the blame for the defeat. Civil War enthusiasts will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent text","review":"A must have surgical anatomy atlas especially for orbital trauma.

The older lens is no longer sold separately by Canon, but is still in their \\"beginner\\" package as of 12/04.

Also, this lens has plastic lens mounts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera for the money.","review":"I recently started a small photography business doing Black and White shots of kids in their natural environment.

I am taking my first real photography class and this camera is perfect for such a class and for taking photos once I've finished the semester. I don't have to spend precious time trying to figure out which knob to turn or button to push. A quick read of the manual lets you know the basic functions and the camera really does a lot of the brain-work. The manual mode lets me fool around with things to get certain moods or feelings and the pictures are turning out great. A lot of the students are having a hard time reading their cameras' meters, but this camera's meter is really simple to read and very easy to see. The price was great and the quality is fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than good enough","review":"After researching several cameras in this price range, I bought the Rebel T2 last month. It has met my expectations and perhaps then some. After recently trying out a friends camera in the 150.-ish range, I partially regret spending what I did. It all comes down to what you need, want, and how many bells and whistles you like. For the money though, compared to the competitors, I still think I made a good purchase. After all, if I use it for ten years, which I most likely will, I will have surely got my moneys worth.

You can also find this info. for free online. Yet, her books are designed to sell her Crystal Star line of products. You can find products way cheaper that are just as good. There are questionable rituals such as the vitamin c flush. Though vitamin c is an important vitamin, in mega doses as she prescribes, vitamin c can kick start the free radical process, which you don't want.

The most frustrating part of this game, was the terrible camera angles that you couln't control. The graphics was decent, it could've improved if it had better lighting/shadowing effect. I had trouble with depth and distance perception because of the lack of lighting/shadowing effects (I had problems judging jumping distances and height). And one other thing, the game was really short, it took less than 2 days to finish (this includes eating, sleeping, and other required activities).All in all... if you wanna play this game, go rent it, its not worth purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"Toy Story 2 is a great movie, but not a great game! The graphics are barely decent, it's too hard to jump high, you can't fly, and it's too simple. I'm no super-beat-a-giant-game-in-two-days person, but this is simple! I beat it in one night! The graphics are so lame it's funny. During the last levels cutscene with Woody and Andy, Woody looks is a limp lifeless pile of pixels waving his arm! You also have to waste a giant chunk of your memory pak to save the game, even though all the cartridge needs to save is the number of tokens you got. This game is better to rent and beat, rather than buy and keep. ... Most of these games are ones that people bought instead of rented, and it was such a short game, they sold it ... for a refund. And what is the major game there? Toy Story 2, of course. Buy some good stuff at the same price like Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"This game is alot like other adventure games.You have to rescue Woody from Al.You're Buzz Lightyear,and you have to destroy evil toys such as robots and helicopters.Another object of the game is to collect Pizza Planet tokens.You get them by doing certain tasks.In every level you have to rescue 6 of something(ducks sheep).You face bosses like Zurg.You also get certain items as you go around.You can get super lasers,batteries Buzz tokens and coins.This game is frustrating because some of the jumps are hard to do and that can tick you off."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good","review":"I bought the game the day after I got a my nintendo 64. I was really excited. But... the graphics are disapointing, you can never tell where you are going because the camera is all over the place, and Buzz is hard to control. If you are older say 11 or above you could probably play this. But kids at that age are not interested in that type of game. Now a little one who's going to really want it is going to get very frustrated with the game. It's VERY disapointing. Little kids will not be able to beat the some-what difficult levels.

While it seems apparent that developer Traveler's Tales tried to make this game good, they weren't successful. This game feels bland and stale because the levels are dull and uneventful, full of too much repetition with the platforming, the controls don't feel intuitive and kinda suck, and the game feels like it's on life support. The lifeless feel of the game are the stupid enemies, the worthless challenges, endless coin collecting, and no level feels alive, it just feels like a braindead game. The highlights of the game are the decent shooter controls, some interesting sections of levels, and some okay graphics. Buzz Lightyear seems fully aware that he sucks on this game when he says \\"You're mocking me aren't you?\\" because he's an idiot and can't jump certain distances without falling endless times. Plus the game's camera rotates itself for you which is a real pain. Only watch the Toy Story movies, just don't play the games."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor offering for younger players","review":"I bought this game for my son, 6. The graphics are dismal (comparedto SuperMario 64 - which he just loves). One is apt to feel sea-sickwhen playing it. Camera angles are poor. Fine control of Buzz's movements is poor.

The replacement unit that Haier sent pumps out cold air for the first 20 minutes of operation and then the compressor turns off never to turn on again. Two broken A/C units in a row. That has to be more than coincidence. When I did a search on the internet I found many other extremely negative reviews of this Haier model.

My negative opinion is because(1) I find the unit noisey compared to several other units I have, but(2) my biggest complaint is that it regulates very badly: it's solid state/remote control with a readout(nice features), but if I set it at 72 or 74F, it will cool down to at least 64 - 66 before shutting down the compressor- way too much swing under my desired setting.

Neither the Pilates DVD nor the Yoga DVD are truly for *beginners*. If you have NEVER done pilates- if you really want to tone up but are out-of-shape, this DVD is NOT for you. I didn't realize that I had purchased yet another Elements DVD, and I will be more careful NEXT TIME. If you need any sort of modification, she barely addresses this. I think ELEMENTS has gotten truly CONFUSED about the word _BEGINNERS_ - both on their beginning yoga DVD and most certainly on this one. If you are wanting to tone up using pilates and have anything like fibromyalgia - or are just wanting to START a program to tone up in the privacy of your home- I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS ONE.

The only pain you have is the good kind, a little muscle soreness from a good workout! I have been using this video for 6 months and it still challenges me! This video has changed my life and it will change yours too! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely LOVED it!","review":"I've been a fan of Brooke's for years -- I've done numerous Pilates dvds and have only been able to do Pilates with Brooke, thus far, with her books, flash cards, and CDs (in the Pilates Body Kit). I've loved her from the start and have been hoping for a dvd.I did this one today and just loved it! Don't worry that it says it's for beginners if you've been doing Pilates for years. This is a solid Intermediate Pilates workout. It's approachable for Beginners, but isn't broken down slowly for explanations like most Beginner Pilates dvds. It flows wonderfully, is full of challenging exercises, and is a pleasure to do with Brooke. Just wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for me....very clear...well rounded","review":"I am a beginner using Pilates. I had already used 2 other Pilate DVDs I'd purchased elsewhere and was enthusiastic about the method but wanted something that was alittle longer and well rounded. I read some of the other reviews. Brook's instructions are VERY clear and concise and she reminds you all the way through how to stay focused and how to do each stretch correctly which is so important. This is my favorite by far. It has been a good stress reliever and I'm amazed at how much flatter my abs are and how toned my legs have become in such a short time---about 8 weeks. I've got 25 lbs to drop and I'm 54 years young."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners!","review":"I bought this DVD looking for a good introduction to Pilates. I dance, walk, and do yoga, so I am somewhat fit, but I am new to Pilates.The first half of this video, Pilates-inspired cardio, is a nice 18-minute routine. It's a little too short, but it does increase the heart rate while toning and lengthening muscles. It was an accessible, enjoyable workout.Most of the DVD is a \\"beginner\\" Pilates workout. I was clearly going to end up frustrated and/or injured, so I stopped. When I told a friend who is a Pilates instructor about the exercises, she agreed that they are not moves for Pilates beginners. She mentioned that some of the exercises, particularly the Scissor, could cause low back injury.Proceed with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging and not too long","review":"My Pilates teacher suggested Brooke Siler's books as a good way to practice at home. I was a little put off by the idea of \\"cardio\\" Pilates, but once I did that section I enjoyed it and felt like it was aerobic without sacrificing the idea of concentration and core. Doing both programs (the cardio section and the mat section) gives a good total body workout without wiping you out for the whole day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Perfect~","review":"I've tried a few different dvd's for beginners pilates and I just happened to run across this one...let me just say, after a couple months of doing this particular dvd, eating healthy, I have lost 11 pounds. AND I feel great! I catch myself staying in good form all day. It is so simple to learn and while its tough at first, it gets easier everytime. I simply cant say enough good. I will never try another type of pilates. I'm excited to go to the next level :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've been using this workout pretty regularly for about three weeks now, and I'm begining to see and feel the difference in my body. The exercises are toning and challenging. The instructor (Brooke Siler) is great, she doesn't \\"push\\" you verbally, but makes you want to try harder anyways. The scenery is also quite lovely (if you have time to look at it between roll-ups), and even the music was nice. I hope they make more like this one in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Element: Pilates Weight Loss for Beginners","review":"I found this workout to be pretty boring.

It's a great start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner DVD","review":"This was my second pilates dvd and I really enjoyed it. I found the routine easy to follow and challenging. I look forward to trying more of her advanced workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This Pilates workout is challenging and yet not too difficult as to make you upset and give up. I've played it several times and haven't gotten tired of the exercises or the instructor, who is nice and real. It's nice having an instructor who has had kids and can still stay in shape.The video has a great setting (as do all of the 'elements' videos). It overlooks the ocean and is just serene. Turn down the lights and light a candle and you could be at a spa.The workout is great for your abs and legs, especially. You'll definitely feel it the next morning, but the workout is easy to follow and enjoyable. After just a few uses, I can already feel myself becoming more flexible. I love this video and it pairs well with the 'ballet conditioning' video from Elements (although that ones a little more difficult).It's a great combination of strength, flexibility, and agility."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pilates DVD does not deliver at all","review":"the dvd does not deliver (let alone weight loss) - very little content, not much to go on in general, only two short sessions, if you decide to call standing and mat workout different sessions; annoying music (would like to turn it off), poor screen resolution, i do not recommend this video"},{"rating":"1","title":"I never received this product.

I was bored!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Favorite","review":"This is a narrated video, and lacked excitement. I was not impressed with explanations, or lack there of.

And I am sorry but I felt like this dvd was just way too easy. I felt no burn while I was doing the exercises and my heart rate barely went up I didn't even break a sweat. I wouldn't recommend it to people who want a really good workout. I think this more for people who are completely out of shape who can't do much exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for true beginners","review":"I thought these were very challenging exercises and not well suited for beginners.

The case I received was neither premium or leather and certainly not the \\"top grain lamb skin with superb craftsmanship\\" as written in the product description. It was some sort of plastic material that had been melted along the edges as a finish. It's garbage but for $14.99 it does serve its purpose which is to protect my phone. If you don't have high expectations its fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of God don't buy this camera","review":"I purchased this camera last year and was very happy with it until recently. For some reason I have trouble when loading a new or partially used roll of film. The letter 'H' appears n teh LCD screen and all the functions do not work. I've had to remove the battery a couple of times to get it to work (I don't know why this works) but lately it hasn't worked on the first few trys. Canon has not helped with this at all. This camera is a complete waste of money. If anyone can tell me what the problem is or recommend a better APS camera I'd appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"36hrs","review":"All of the ratings I've come across were excellent for this elph...unfortunately I would have to strongly disagree. I bought the camera specifically for a trip to Europe and it broke on the second day. The 25 shots or so that I did take were ok, but with no consistency. Half of the pictures were beautiful the other half were out of focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"good customer service","review":"I've had the Elph 370Z for nearly two years and I like it quite a bit. Six months after I bought it the LCD screen died. I was able to drop the camera off at Canon in Irvine and within a week it was fixed, free of charge. The photos i have gotten are better than I would have expected from a camera that only uses 22 mm film. The small form factor is the nicest feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible camera, Worse customer service","review":"I used this camera once and it took relatively good pictures. However, on my next trip, the camera's internal memory stopped working (this is a problem that other people I know have had with the camera). Worse than the camera's malfunction, however, was the company's refusal to service the camera under warranty. Moreover, when I sent the camera back, they refused to write a letter justifying the lack of service. I would not buy a piece of Canon equipment. Save some money and buy an Olympus Stylus, which has served me quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it and went digital","review":"We are headed on vacation in a couple of weeks and I thought it would be a good time to get a lightweight compact camera. I had heard good things about the elf, and although I hadn't ever tried APS film I thought this would be a good time. I shot 3 rolls of film, in all kinds of lighting conditions. I tried indoors, outdoors, sunny days, after dark and cloudy days. I have to tell you that repeatedly it felt like the pictures were over-exposed. The elf's ability to balance exposure to suit a setting really goes haywire when it has to balance higher contrast. The red-eye feature didn't work so swell, and my pictures just weren't up to par. We are returning it and going digital. I bought the digital elf and shot several shots, printed them and they give me the pictures, color and resolution I am looking for. I think this little camera was a bit overhyped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent, but...","review":"My wife and I bought this camera two years ago, before our first child was born. We've been very happy with its performance, and found the picture quality much better than other cameras. In the last few months, however, the camera no longer accepts new rolls of APS film. Instead, it changes the cartridge from \\"new roll\\" to \\"exposed,\\" without taking any pictures. We brought this camera to the camera shop, and they told us that it was a common problem with this model, and that it would cost [a lot] to have it repaired. We then called Canon, and they did not admit or deny the history of this problem. They just told us that the new Z3 did not seem to have the same issues.Overall, we really like this camera. We're probably going to try the Z3, however, for our next camera. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware of this camera!","review":"I received this camera as a gift 2 and a half years ago and loved it during most of that time. The problem with this camera is that once the warranty expires, the camera will soon follow! It started flashing 'H' (meaning the camera no longer works) shortly after the warranty expired. Good luck getting any help from Canon, after months of trying, they wouldn't help out at all. They won't even tell you what is wrong with it unless you agree to pay them for repairs! Search the web and you'll find this happens to everyone. This camera is junk and you should avoid it like the plague..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent features!","review":"I replaced my Pentax point & shoot with the Cannon Elf and I'm glad I did. The regular/wide angle/panoramic shot selection is fabulous! The red-eye reduction worked great as well. The fact that it is so small is a definite plus also. The only thing that could be improved upon is that the zoom feature. I would have liked it to be a greater range so you can get even closer on far away subjects."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELPH 37OZ is the best!","review":"I would like to say the the Cannon ELPH37OZ is worth the money.

Pay the extra money and get this one rather than some cheap inferior camera"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design VERY POOR QUALITY","review":"This could be a great product, but it is a piece of junk. I bought one and returned it because the earphone jack caused the sound to come on and off. I bought another one from a different vendor, thinking it was unlikely I would get the defect a second time. WRONG. Same exact problem -- the ear phone jack is bad. Now all of a sudden the thing is turning itself off and then on again. And forget about getting ANY help from TrekStor at all. I plan to use this one until it dies, which will likely be next week, because it is too much of an aggravation to return it, but I won't be buying any more TrekStor products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blues that Rock!","review":"Maybe the others who reviewed this never played the cd.

The new CD, Deleware Crossing, is even better and gets five stars, why don't you have that one for sale?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Wolfe HOWLS!","review":"I challenge anyone who \\"gets\\" the blues to not love this cd. It has everything one could ask for and more. The blues aspect of this cd is very strong but also the vocals,lyrics and music are wonderful. On top of all that, it is a pleasure to sit back and listen to Mr. Wolfe's guitar playing. (If one can actually sit back while listening) If he doesn't move you, then you better check your pulse. I am looking forward in the future to purchasing any of Wolfe's music. I recommend that you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't always trust the reviews","review":"This is fairly standard blues fair without a great deal of ability or originality.

The best track is BLACK NIGHT ( an old standard ) and even that is nothing special. The original material makes you wish for more covers as they never reach any hights.I can see why there are many ... copies on the second hand market, mine will go the same way again as there are so many outstanding CD's in this genre and this is definitely a very weak effort.P.S.... yes I listened to this CD about a dozen times before writting this and yes it is as bad as that.P.S.

He likes this big Thomas puzzle because, at age 4, he can do it all by himself. The pieces are big, which not only makes it easier to grasp and manipulate, but easier to comprehend the shape and the picture pattern as well. Of course, he likes that it is Thomas, and he even likes the \\"cool\\" box it comes in.So this puzzle has a lot of replay value, because whenever we start a puzzle session, he will eventually move to this one to show mommy and me that he can do it all by himself, and that makes him feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book About Panama with Substance!","review":"Lindsay-Poland has written an exceptional book that brings to light fascinating information about US activities and motivations in Panama. Anyone interested in Panama and/or US-Panama relations must read this book.

The book is factual, insightful and enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative but too angry","review":"Very well researched but the author obviously has a chip on his shoulder. He takes every opportunity to blast the U.S. Government (sometimes rightfully so) but the book would be much more bearable if he would just present the facts without taking every opportunity to play-up how the upper-class Americans oppressed, exploited and took advantage of the lower-class (Indian and African workers). I was looking for a book that presented a comprehensive history but the author is just too angry to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disappointment","review":"Why can't some people write honest and balanced history?The author has obviously done a lot of research, but his vitriol and one-side interpretation of virtualy every U.S.-Panamanian event diminishes the effect his book could have had.What a shame.

The beauty of Rob E is how he gives you a Breaks feel while bordering the funky stuff with trance overlaying. The album maintains a flowing sense of freshness.

The controls are so lousy that performing simple tasks such as running straight across a beam or board is very difficult. The camera almost never lets you see where you are going, so you fall off objects this way too. It's way too frustrating to play because even completing these tasks isn't rewarding, you just move on to more. You can't see where you are going, over jump objects all of the time, and fall from places that are a pain in the [behind] to get to anyway. If I want a game that's difficult, it should be hard to figure out or there should be tough battles. Walking and jumping should not be the challenge.

But after some coaching from his daddy and myself, he's become quite a player. He's jumping around and climbing ropes and all sorts of obstacles.

This was a great purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"murky mirror","review":"Wanting a better close-up bathroom viewer, I ordered this mirror. All was as described in the product description.....A handy add on for makeup. I found the mirror glass to be murky and had a \\"grayish\\" cast. My old mirror gave a brighter reflection. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor design","review":"This product is very poorly designed and poorly made. It does not function well. Motion too stiff. Mirror magnification too extreme. 5x or even 4x would be enough. With 7 times you must get too close to the mirror to make it useful. The mounting screws are wrong for the job. The philips head is easily stripped. Badly made, badly designed. Had I known I never would haver bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Mirror","review":"Can't say enough about how pleased I am with this purchase. I only received it yesterday and I love it. It is heavy andwell build. The nickel is beautiful. Not to mention how wonderful to see the back of my hair without having to hold ahand mirror. Don't know how I got along without it. Worth every penny. Can't go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice value!","review":"I ordered this mirror because I needed it to see to be able to floss better! LOL.

This mirror was very easy to install. It is sturdy and uses very little space when folded away. It's perfect for me.

Great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"An OK mirror with a tight scissor and easily unscrewing nuts","review":"The mirror is well designed and functions properly (which is difficult not to do for a mirror). However, the scissor may be too tight if you plan to constantly pull the mirror in and out. Also, the nuts on the movable parts get loose after you moved the mirror in some direction (for instance, if you rotate it, the side nuts may get unscrewed without weekly? tightening)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The back of my hair looks great!","review":"The maintenance man in our building quickly installed the mirror for me.

Whether shaving or putting on makeup you will love this mirror. It's right there when you need it, but out of the way when you don't.I should add that while it comes with all the hardware necessary to mount it, you will probably have to make a trip to the hardware store if you are mounting it to sheetrock. Not including the trip to the store, it only took me five minutes with a drill and some expansion bolts.Oh, yeah. The magnifying side can be a little scary but you'll get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mirror","review":"Bought this to replace the IKEA one that looks almost exactly like this. Do yourself a favor, spend the extra ten bucks and get this one. It is more solidly built, more stable, and the optics are infinitely better. Not simply that the magnification is a gazillion times stronger (slightly exaggerated), but it has a bigger surface and even on the 1x side, everything is so much more crisp and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnification too much","review":"In our last home, we had a similar mirror from Ikea that was 3x in magnification. We found this was not enough. When we moved, I ordered this 7x mirror. In construction, it is similar to the Ikea mirror.The reason I removed one star is because unlike the Ikea mirror, this one constantly unscrews - this is just from me pushing it back to shave while my wife pulls it forward to put on contacts and make-up. This was never an issue with the Ikea mirror. I finally had to use some Loctite Blue to prevent it unscrewing.I have not removed any stars but 7x is way too much magnification for shaving. I can only see one side of my face at a time and I have to close one eye to do that. The curvature of the mirror distorts the reflection too much. I would suggest a 5x mirror would be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mirror","review":"Installed easily looked great out the packageCons:-once installed the swinging motion of the arm cannot be controlled, it either swings all the way forward into your face or goes all the way back. I had to use a wrench to hold it in place while I use it. since im a guy i only use it when I line my beard up, which is about once a week so its not that big a deal for me.Pros:-magnification is great clear mirror dual sidedness is a definite plus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Delivery was very fast. This is an outstanding product. The unit is very strong and made well. I recommend this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good extension and size, but poor hardware","review":"This mirror has a nice long extension and is large in diameter. It was easy enough to install with one caveat. The plastic screw casing that goes into the drywall to hold the screw in place was too short (sorry forgot what those things are called). Once I put it in and it was flat against the wall, as soon as I put the screw in, one pushed in all the way and was gone. The other screw went in, but would not screw in all the way and seemed to spin. It was as if the screw was too small for the hole in the plastic.Luckily I had others in the house and got long ones (almost 2 inches) and plugged them into the existing holes. They worked fine and since the internal space for the screw (in the plastic) was tight, the screw went it fine with a power driver and stayed in.It would be helpful if the directions told you what size drill bit to use for the holes in the wall. I just started smaller and went up to the right size eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scissor way too tight","review":"Scissor mechanism is very tight and requires too much force to adjust mirror.

The extension from the wall is just right. The nickel finish matches all of my other bathroom accessories. The only down-side is that the 7x mirror shows all of my fine-lined wrinkles!! LOL Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little mirror","review":"I'm near sided and needed a mirror that would come to me in the bathroom. This one does the trick. I use it everyday.

I could cut my own hair using the mirror because I could see the back of my head perfectly. This round mirror is nicer looking than the square one, but it doesn't extend out from the wall as far, so I can no longer cut my hair because I can only see one side of my head. I'm going to order a square mirror and see if it still has the longer extension."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jerdon JP2027N-8-inch Wall Mount Mirror, 7X Magnification Nickel","review":"The description and the actual product matched perfectly and the price was realistic.

Ok, I thought, these things happen. I was not too happy about the 8 hours it took to fix my machine and get everything cleaned & reset up.Then another virus got past the firewall, not so much as a bleep. The computer was scanned by Micro Trend and it showed no virus. There was NO doubt that there was a virus on the machine and after doing a little research on-line I found it was an older virus (from 2002 I think), so my Micro Trend should have had the virus definition for it & should have found it.I uninstalled Micro Trend and installed McAfee.

Probably most copies sold sit on shelves and just look good. It was supposed to be the first in a series but it happens to be the only one ever made. I appreciated it for the number of writers that were included. Seldom will one find as many diverse opinions on the socially responsible investing (SRI) industry inside one cover. At this point there is nothing of value if you want \\"new\\" and \\"up to date\\" info. But from a historical perspective, it is a significant work. I suppose my only real criticism is that the editor gave it a \\"positive\\" tenor. The SRI movement has negative aspects too, but for some reason no such submissions made it into the finished work. I'd say it was too positive and could even be accused of being a marketing tool to talk-up things, generate their own excitement and hope it spills over to the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tool for the job hunter","review":"This is a great book by Tom Jackson.

True, that means I'm not a true yogi. I just like the exercise part of yoga.This DVD doesn't do it for me. I did the PM segment, and there was a whole lot of breathing and a little stretching. It was SO slow, that instead of feeling relaxed, I started feeling uptight that it wouldn't move on.For true yogis, this may be a great DVD. If you're like me, and you want a little more exercise and a little less meditation, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Element: AM & PM Yoga for beginners","review":"Yoga has always seemed rather \\"new age\\" for my taste, so my decision to try this DVD was a whim. However, after spending time with both the AM and PM yoga programs, I've decided that I may have misjudged yoga as a practice. I found both the AM and PM programs to be easy for a beginner to follow without being condescendingly simple. I always feel energized after the AM program and feel like my muscles have gotten a challenge. The PM program is relaxing and really helps me distance myself from the stress of life and work. I'm always ready for a good night's sleep after this program. As a yoga instructor, Elena Brower is informative yet very soothing. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has considered yoga but doesn't know where to start. I've thoroughly enjoyed having this one and use it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gentile Inspiring way to greet and finish out your day","review":"I purchased this DVD with a little trepidation, as I've never been very good at Yoga. As soon as I put the DVD in I began to feel a little better, as the instructor, Elena Brower, introduced the program and explained the purpose of the different segments.The AM section does exactly what it claims, incorporating movement between various poses to add a small bit of aerobic exercise in. By the end of the AM section I felt charged and fully awake.I would recommend this DVD to anyone looking to add Yoga into their fitness routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Yoga sessions","review":"If you want a little yoga to start your take with serenity or calm you down at the end of the day, this video may be just what you need. The difficulty is medium. It's soothing and easy to follow. If anything is too difficult you can easily moderate it to fit your body.Yoga is relaxing and soothing to the body. Although there is a religious reference to Yoga, most of us simply do it because 'it feels good.' I would rather spend the bulk of my exercise time on something that burns more calories, but you can't beat starting or ending the day with these stretches. aahhhh. The counter to all the stressful things I put on myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"AM Good, PM Mediocre!","review":"The AM portion of this DVD was great, but the PM version was pretty blah. I understand that yoga is about breathing, but JUST breathing? I thought stretching was involved, too. I've used it once. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it and its practical!","review":"Easy to read. Somewhat repetitive. Talks about how to be a female dominant. Proper spanking and caning techniques. She addresses the five most common male fantasies in the bdsm world and talks about the emotional side of it, which is something that is lacking in many other books. Overall, great book, especially for beginners like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading!!","review":"If you are looking for a manual on what to learn to be a mistress then this book can definitely help you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysoginistic. . .","review":"Most of this book is tainted with this woman's petty revenge fantasies. She can't seem to seperate the idea of a well balanced BDSM relationship, founded on ideas such as trust and respect, from her indignacy at her perceived \\"second class citizen\\" status because she is a woman. I know several very self possessed dominant women in my circle who were aghast at the lack of respect represented in this book for the submissive partner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I wasn't entirely impressed with this book. I was looking more for advice on when to punish a submissive, scripts, stuff like that. Everything in the book is basic knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Intro to D/s","review":"If your lover has asked you to engage in BDSM or erotic roleplay and you've never really had an interest yourself OR you are the lover and you're looking for a little intro book to help out your would-be-domme, this book could be helpful for you. The author has put in considerable effort to explain the why's and how's of Dominance/submission - and tries to make it seem okay/\\"normal\\" to someone who may be nervous or concerned about engaging in BDSM or erotic roleplay.However, if you have even the slightest dominant inclination, interest or experience, this book will be a waste of time and money. If you are already into BDSM and feel good about it, then you've already passed this book by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent with a smile","review":"Few books about this topic are as humorous, insightfull and acurate. Mistress Lorelei has written a book that has a decidely female perspective to it (grin) yet bares the poor males inner thinking with cunning precision. It is almost like a licence to exploit men, who will gladly surrender to any Female knowing how to apply the subtle art of Femdom as described by Mistress Lorelei.Whether you are involved in the scene already or are getting to ready to join, you will find invaluable advice in this easy to read, decidely erotic and non-threatening book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mistress Manual: The Good Girl's Guide to Female Dominan","review":"If anyone has any questions, doubts of how to do femdom, or where to start a scene, this book tells how.

This book will show you how to have fun with female dominance"},{"rating":"1","title":"a very limited view","review":"this book was very disappointing, it is a very limited point of view written for a committed male/female couple and no one else, also only talks about \\"domestic discpline\\" not really about the BDSM mindset.

It's everything the author says and more but most importantly (for me)- it is one of the few books that stresses that this should be done for the couple's MUTUAL pleasure. I also think it may be the only book out there that comes from a mongamous loving relationship viewpoint - not that is the only way to go in this lifestyle but very rarely talked about. It's fun, HUMAN, and very very helpfull. I have recommend the books to others - no complaints so far. Screw the Roses is the best book out there. This, IMO is a close second.

You can record off of CDs, you can mix up already made riffs, or make your own, and you can make a 3D movie to go with your music. Defenitely the best game of 2000 so far.

Memorize a few button presses and you can be putting songs together in no time. Pick from hundreds of melodies, bass lines, drum parts, sound effects, and percussion samples and paste them together to make a song. It's that easy. You can even create your own riff if you've got the patience for it. Then you can even create your own music video to along with your song.This game did not recieve as much attention as it should have, but I strongly reccomend it. The only two flaws are the slowdown that occurs from time to time, especially during the video editing, and the songs take up an enormous amount of space on your memory cards."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music creation","review":"I thought that MTV Music Generator was a good product. The part where you can record from your own cd is good but when I use the sample in my own riff, it always speeds it up so fast that you can't even understand it.

I listened to a few of the songs from his \\"Live from Jerusalem\\" album there on Mp3.com and, when I was amazed by what I heard, googled him, discovering that he's been discovered by enthusiasts of 'outsider music' and, following their suggestions, I eventually found this page.There are many glowingly exultant 5 star reviews of Tom Arico here -- and you may ultimately agree with them. Or, perhaps you'll agree with the buyer from London who lamented her foolishness in believing those glowing reviews at face value.At any rate, I STRONGLY SUGGEST that, before you spend your money, you listen to some of his music...I found it, well, let's say, highly entertaining (but couldn't in all conscience give it anything but the star rating above.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One born every minute","review":"Whilst looking for the song Laurie by Alessi, one of my all time favourites, I stumbled upon this album. Ignoring one rather caustic critique, I absorbed the positive comments made by the other reviewers, to the man waxing lyrical about Tom Arico's unique style.I took the plunge and ordered and I have to say that I have to agree that in his field, Tom has few peers. He has taken the rulebook and tossed it out of the window. Who was it who said that you could need to at least be moderately talented in the singing department to knock out an album? Musically, my renderings on the kazoo are all that I can think of that might be compared unfavourably to this album. Self-confidence is something that Mr Arico cannot be short of although I doubt whether the queues to his concerts stretch around too many blocks.A fool and his money are easily parted and on this occasion the fool is me.

There are plently of good musicians in the world. But I have never heard any music that affects me as deeply or feels as timeless and spiritual as the music of The Preacher. The poses, the overwrought emotionalism of so much music has no hold in here. The young, enchanted Tom Arico merely stands on a portal to the otherworlds and sings like a yogi on a moutaintop, in a cave, at the edge of a great forest, on the bank of a babbling brook. I cannot write what this album sounds like, only that I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great resource for first-timers","review":"This book provides a good basic set of data and student comments on most of the colleges we're considering. A good companion is \\"Students' Guide to Colleges,\\" which covers only the top 100 colleges, but is brutally honest. This Insider's Guide tends to present a pretty positive view of each college, although it provides a little more insight than just looking at the college's own website or viewbook. The Insider's Guide has colleges grouped by state.

The Stone Balloon, a historic University of Delaware Bar and Music Hall, announced more than a year ago that it was going to be knocked down and replaced by condiminiums on Main Street. This was true, and it was closed for the spring, and camera crews were there at the beginning of the summer to see huge bulldozers knock it over.

No other work of Thoreau's better exhibits his discipline as a writer and his devotion to the natural world. In the Journal can be found the fragmented foundations of masterpieces such as Walden, A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, The Maine Woods, and Cape Cod. But what is perhaps more interesting to a reader of Thoreau's Journal are his thoughts and insights on topics such as friendship, love, religion, nature, bravery, heroism, war, slavery, the art of writing, and, most important to Thoreau, the art of living. Anyone with any interest in Thoreau will find his Journal to be an invaluable aid in understanding and following the life of one of America's most profound prose writers"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Three Mystery's in one","review":"Wonderful mystery book for the young investigator you have to keep your eyes open the whole story.

I had, hitherto now, really relied on the DJs from the United Kingdom for my musical enjoyment, and with the exceptions of Deep Dish and Danny Tenaglia, I have largely given US DJs a pass.

Plenty good enough for a home workshop. Only drawback I found was that the zerk fittings on the aluminum wheels (yes these castors are greaseable at the swivel and at the wheel) were not tight and when greased and one stripped right out of it's hole! After I tightened up the zerk fittings and used a little more caution the rest seemed to be just fine. Brake functions very well, and is positive and the castors swivel/roll very nicely. Overall, very good castors for the money and I'd still buy/recommend these units for home/workshop duty."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"After buying a dozen or so contemporary Kindle books that were under $3, I'm going to stop buying these cheap books.

When I complained to the company about the product, they were a bit resistant to accepting it back & I had to pay $10.00 shipping to return it. I just felt that using it on a tool that was spinning @ 11K RPM's wasn't a good idea. On the plus side, the arm seemed to be fairly stable but after opening the box & looking at it's construction, I just put it back & started the return process. Another thing is, they ship it without any washers that are most essential if you were to try to use it because I'm sure the vibration would cause the bolts to loosen & cause more problems or injury."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass on this - not a quality item","review":"I rarely use this because of it's rickety feel.

However, this does make it a \\"masterpiece\\". It is true, progress must always come from change, and \\"Dr. Octagonecologyst\\" is indeed different. But juvenile, egocentric fantasy (If you want real science fiction, science fiction with a purpose, read Stanislaw Lem) and childish humor are not progress.

Some songs after it that I thought about the lyrics, I think they tell a very real story. \\"Half-alligator\\" is a SKK cover, even improves that before the time. But after that all this I think that Dr. Octagon needs a better assoli of guitar, or at least one, I mean please.

I did enjoy it; it provides quirky beats along with interesting/strange skits. However, alot of the lyrics don't rhyme, which is one thing I do like when it comes to rap. The lyrics are essentially incomprehensible. Yes, it's English all right, but nothing he seems to say makes any sense, as there is no real, general theme to follow.

That says something by itself -- what other rap album could stand alone on solely the background beats? \\"Blue Flowers\\", \\"3000\\", \\"Dr. Octagon\\", and \\"Girl, Let Me Touch You\\" stand out, but almost all the tracks are excellent.

When listening to some of the dirtier songs, all rectums, juicy brown booties and cirumcision talk, you get the impression that the album's a one trick pony. Then listen to 'Biology 101' and he sounds like he's studied quantum mechanics for the last ten years! If this version omits Biology 101, you're really missing something. It's all good - the choruses admittedly get repetitive (especially Earth People), and the porno skits are best skipped, but it's worth the price alone for the truly demented lyrics about horses loose in hospitals, rectal rebuilding and Keith demanding us to touch his delicate instrument.

This is not available i don't think on amazon but you can get it through their website. Midnite has many albums which vary somewhat in style and i've found this album to be the most like \\"Unpolished\\". Although i don't think its quite as good as \\"Unpolished\\", its most definitely worth checking out and is very good. Also don't miss \\"Ras Mek Peace\\" which was recorded only using two mics and contains no added effects.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lebbey Polaris Drinking Glasses & Tumblers","review":"I also purchased these glasses, and have only a few left!! They go into the dishwasher in one piece and come out in a few pieces. They look pretty enough but because the bottom is so heavy when they are in the dishwasher, due to the water pressure and the weight of the bottom they tip over onto the other glasses next to them, so if you are not able to secure them into your dishwasher so that they will not move, or anchor them with another bowl/or something so that they will not move they will break!!!!! They are awful!!!!!! What happened to the good old days when the glasses used to be durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break very easily!!!!","review":"I really like the look and feel of these glasses. The base is very stable and they have a more expensive look. However, the upper part of the glass is EXTREMELY thin and breaks very easily. I broke one glass when I tried to dry the inside with a dishtowel! The short glasses are much more durable. All but two of the tumblers are broken, thought most of the short glasses are still usable. Above all, don't put the tumblers in the dishwasher. It's very hard to get all the glass out when they break. I'm shopping for some different ones right now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what was expected","review":"These glasses were not what I expected nor how they were described on amazon. The base was way too bulky and large. They were rather ugly. The body seemed thin and would break easily. I found nicer ones at Walmart for only $9.99 so I returned these to amazon. They came with both sizes, had a better design and seem much more sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice set of glasses!","review":"I'm really happy with my purchase of these glasses. They are a bit heavy so if you're not into heavy drinking glasses then I wouldn't purchase these. The weight is also all at the bottom of the glass which could be ackward for some people. I however love the style and really enjoy using them. They look and feel like expensive glasses and they were right around $20.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine glassware","review":"This is a fine set of glasses.

Don't waste your money if you intend to put them in the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin. Cracked after 2nd wash.","review":"I loved the look of these glasses, and at first really enjoyed them. After two washes, the top of one of the drinking glasses cracked.

Since I've had them the rims have cracked on 3 of the glasses, and I've since had to discard them all.Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"If you like spilling your drink all the time, these are perfect. Yes they are attractive, I love the simple lines and the curve at the bottom. They are heavy making them feel nice in your hand. However, I am constantly knocking them over, spilling their contents, and even breaking them. If I hadn't ordered them on line, I'd have returned them. Maybe soon they'll all be broken and I'll be searching for a new set. I say keep looking, they just aren't stable enough to be practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"The glasses are great--the packaging was not.","review":"My advice--do not order this item. It came in an oversized box with little padding between the Libbey box and the big box. The big box was very cheap and thin. No surprise then that one glass was completely shattered. The box came dented in in many places; there was not one mark labeling it as fragile or glass. Poorly done Amazon; a first for me from them. Now I am trying to find a way to get some kind of small credit for the one broken glass, and there is no such link."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Damaged","review":"These glasses were a Christmas gift for my sister but unfortunatley they arrived broken and she just threw them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great glasses!","review":"I bought these for my office and like them so much, I am buying a set for home.

All too often, they make assumptions about what a child knows and is able to do or what a child is actually feeling and why. Such assumptions can wreak havoc in the lives of the thousands of immigrant children who come to our classrooms from their home cultures each day speaking a language other than English. Eva Hoffman's book, more than any other work I know, allows a teacher to learn and FEEL what it is really like to make that ultimate journey from the culture and language of one's birth, of one's heart, into the English-speaking world.

More geared towards girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fabulous historical fiction novel!","review":"This is a great historical piece of literature. You feel like you're in the medieval time period as you read it. The descriptions are wonderful! This is the story of a young girl who helps a midwife deliver babies. She's called the midwife's apprentice, however, that's not the only thing she is called. Her names consist of girl, Beetle, and Brat. She sleeps with animals in barns and wears old rags. People torment her with names and threats, but she holds her head high and believes inherself. Eventually, she wants to deliver a baby all by herself, but the midwifee tells her she's stupid. However one day she can't find the midwife so she tries to deliver the baby herself but she just can't do it. She has failed and she runs away believing she can rid herself of her problems. This book teaches you not to run away from your problems. It's great historical fiction and is easy to follow. It's a great book to read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midwife","review":"Who lives outside in barns, begging for food? Well, in a book called The Midwife's Apprentice, Alyce, aslo known as Dung or Brat does. Since she is starving, she asks people for jobs she can do. Aluce finally convines a midwife, called Jane, to give her a job. Alyce also tells Jane if she works, she wants food in return. Jane agrees to the deal, and that's when Alyce journey begins.I didn't really like this book since it was boring. Even though the book was dull, I think Karen Cushman did a good job of expressing emotions of the characters, like when boys called Alyce names. I also feel a connection to the book. When Aluce didn't do an important assignment, she felt ashamed. I feel ashamed when I don't do something important properly. Karen Cushman has also written other books like Catherine Called Birdy.Really, I wouldn't reccomend this book to to anybody since it was boring. But I think people could learn from the moral of the story: which is hard work pays of."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!","review":"A heart-warming story about a young girl who learns to believe in herself and find hope to live in Medieval England.

Alyce who was poor, homeless and nameless got a chance of a lifetime to be the apprentice of the crabby, mean, Jane Sharp. Alyce she runs away from her mistake and doesn't fix it. Never the right choice. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes this kind of story. It's a very good book!. I give it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gross","review":"I though this book was gross because when Alyce was trying to help, that lady gave birth she was really screming.I learnd that dung is a good to sleep in because it provides heat really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Both my daughter and I loved this book. It is well written, captures your attention at every turn and the character has a very realistic voice. There are wonderful lessons about finding your way in the world and getting back up no matter what life throw you. I can't recommend this highly enough.I would recommend adults read this first and then read it with your child. It was set in the middle ages, and contains some intense scenes ( She is a midwife's apprentice after all).This book lingers with you long after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! In the town where Beetle lives, Beetle is treated as a noone, but only until Jane takes her off the streets and hires her as her new apprentice.

It's a great book and it deserves to be read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Midwife's Apprentice","review":"The Midwife's Apprenticeis a great book! this book is for forth graders, fifth graders, and sixth graders. I personally think its genre is historical fiction because it took place a long time ago but the characters are not real. This book takes in the Middle Agesin a little town. Its about a midwife and her apprentice! They make medicine and deliver babies for women. I thought it was really well written because some I understood every word. It got m attention because some parts were really exciting. Karen Cushman is a great writer. she makes it hard to put this book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Midwife's Amazing Apprentice","review":"I am writing this book review, because it was assigned as a class project by my teacher.In the book The Midwife's Apprentice a cold frosty evening a girl with no home, no parents, and nothing but the name Brat finds a place to sleep in a dung heap. When later that evening the midwife finds her and not only gives her the name Beetle, but she also becomes her new apprentice. One day she messes up on an important task and runs away. She also gives herself a new name, Alyce.I rated my book a 4, because it was good more towards the middle.I would recommend this book to anybody who likes to read books or read books like this one in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong storytelling!","review":"A compelling story about a young girl lost - no name, no parent, no shelter, no food, no age. She stumbles across a greedy midwife, who is kind enough to offer the young girl food as long as she works.This was a fast read (I read it in 45 minutes) and enjoyed it thoroughly, especially when she gave herself a name. This should be on everyone's reading list."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"If not scholarly in its authenticity...\\"","review":"This is a fun book, not too long for your average 'chapter book reader,' that takes you to a different time and place.I'm not sure what the time or place is -- the landscape is medieval Britain, as advertised, but the characters are most definitely not -- but the psycho-cultural inaccuracies are usually easy to overlook, and you get a funny, colorful, interesting book filled with details of what para-medical support was available at the time for pregnant women.Cushman is at her best with intelligent, feisty, growing young women, and this book is true to that vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for young kids","review":"This book is about a girl that lives on the street and doesn't have a home. She gets teased alot by other kids. Then one day she meets Jane the midwife, who needs a helper. So the young homeless girl finally had a home and a place to stay and keep warm. This book is a very good book for young readers. It has a good story behind it and you could really learn alot about caring for others if you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book with a purpose","review":"this book was one of the best i ever read. it portrayed life in the middle ages as it was for many of the common people. it wasnt to detailed, and kept your interest the whole time. it was about a girl called beetle, who later called herself alyce, and her quest to become a midewifes apprentice with a place in the world, and a place she could call home."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a snore!","review":"This is an extremely tedious novel. it is about a girl who helps out a midwife but then goes and runs away to an inn. It is an elementary book. This is not interesting because all the girl wants to do is make a name for herself. You cannot relate to her at all because she doesn't do anything except chores and, well, midwifing. She doesn't think about anything else throughout the whole book and when you're done you can't believe you wasted your time on such a boring book! Sorry, Amazon, but this book is not worth your money. If you're just DYING to read it get it at a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed","review":"I was disappointed by Karen Cushman's work. I think she could have done alot better, as she has done in the past. I read this book expecting alot better then what I got! Still, my time reading wasn't wasted; I learned something about midevil times, and it was very nice for some short reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The medieval Story","review":"I though this book was okay because,Alyce was so poor then she became a midwife apprentice The part I dislike was when Alyce was always picked on."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was boring.","review":"Maybe because I am a boy but this book was boring because the plot wasn't really on the story. The author tried to tell us too much about potions and stuff. The beginning of the story was really disgusting when Alyce was sleeping in the dung heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's printed on!","review":"I thought this book was vulgar and very inappropriate to its intended age group. I would label this book \\"cruelty as entertainment\\". To name just one (of many) of the troubling scenes in this book is the childbirth scene in which the mid-wife wants to collect two fees from birthing mothers, but intends to leave one baby to die unborn.The language and subject matter is too mature for this age. Some themes in the book are cruelty to animals, disrespect for life, lack of good moral characters.I think, in a time when our youth are struggling to find a healthy self-image and healthy relationships with others, this is a book that should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This book tramatised me. I read it when I was in the fourth grade. It was the worst book ever. I recomend no one reads it. It was a waste of paper and ink."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Catherine, called Birdy","review":"Though not as clever or witty as CATHERINE, CALLED BIRDY, THE MIDWIFE's APPRENTICE is a more serious and lonely story of a girl without the priveldges of a princess-as Catherine has- but is more down to earth and meek, making her a more delecate person to read. While I was dissapointed to find that there was no little romance story twisted in, this book was quite capable of keeping me awake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gOoD, hEaRtWaRmInG sToRy","review":"this book was sort of short and sweet. i don't like being bogged down in a 300 page book, so this was an awesome light read. i think that any girl from the ages of 12-14 should read this. in the book, it is about a girl with some troubles that she works to overcome. but i think it has an underlying message. it really hits on the note of not giving up. i learned from this book that the worst mistake you can ever is not being thrown down by defeat, its letting yourself stay down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Midwife's Apprentince","review":"The Midwife's Apprentice is about an orphaned girl, forced to live by herself, nameless, except for Beetle. She meets a midwife named Jane Sharp, and becomes her apprentince. She meets new people, and actually some kind people, although most are cruel. She finds a cat, whom she names Purr, and a man who accidentally calls her Alyce, and she talkes the name. I thought this book was okay. It wasn't great, but it was semi-amusing. It was a little too short, though, because I usually read books averaging 100 pages or longer. It was very nicely written, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique blend of piano, electronics, and feeling","review":"It doesn't have to be raining to enjoy Color Theory, but it is preferred. Brian Hazard (aka Color Theory) reintroduces the long-lost art of singer-songwriter for the piano (and accompanying electronics). Themes range from melancholy romantic musings in \\"September Spoke In Red\\" to the more upbeat gaity of \\"Heart Like A Doll\\". All the songs deal with love (either lost or gained) in some way, but there is considerable breadth and interest in the way they are presented. The performance is great, as Hazard has a very pleasant voice that wonderfully accompanies his deft piano arrangements. This is a great CD to listen to and relax, unwind. This isn't to say that it is all slow,...... oh, quit listening to me, just buy it already......"},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll blow you away!","review":"The lyrics, music and voice behind 'Tuesday Song' will definitely blow you away.

Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just so so","review":"I didn't find this pillow to be of much support or use in my pregnancy. The velcro came unattached fairly easily, and it got shifted into a million wrong positions very easily as well. I purchased a full body pillow that curved at the top and bottom for support, and while it was a space taker in the bed, it was much more comfy and useful than this thing. This ended up accumulating dust under my bed instead of actually being used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like sleeping in a jail","review":"I tried this around 5 or 6 months pregnant and found it left me in even more joint pain than the over-sized body pillow I was hoping to replace.

In 40 years of personal record-collecting and appreciation of recorded music, I would place this album on my top ten favorites list of all time. I simply never tire of listening to this visceral, heartfelt rendition of the blues. He never puts a note wrong. Even after playing this record perhaps a thousand times, it still sends chill up my spine.Johnny himself was never able to top this material on subsequent recordings. This record is a watershed in the history of recorded blues music, at least, the Texas blues genre as performed by white people. And, no one is more white than Johnny Winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play it loud","review":"The album that started it all (along with the PROGRESSIVE BLUES EXPERIMENT). Is it worth it? Yes.

Why would anyone ruin the music of Ode to Joy with such background noise? I wouldn't waste my money or time listening to this CD. There are professional versions of Symphony No. 9 available elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the passion, not for CD quality sound","review":"I appreciate the many reviews espousing the tension, dynamics and passions of the performance, but for the uninitiated like myself, hearing coughs, hiss and static on a CD is a disappointment.If you want a crystal clear version of the Ninth to enjoy at home.. look somewhere else. And if you ever find one let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Construction dvd for 2 year old","review":"Our two year old grandson is nuts about construction....big trucks, bull dozers, etc. We ordered this dvd for him. This dvd is better suited for older boys, probably 4-6 years old. He will watch it for a couple of minutes, but there is too much talking and too little action for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"good edition of an Orthodox classic","review":"This is a very readable translation of the Ladder. I found both of the introductions scholarly but easy to understand. I think they do about as good a job as possible of setting the Ladder in a context that modern Christians can accept. I noted that one person did not like Kallistos Ware's introduction, but I thought it was quite good.The translation by Holy Transfiguration Monastery is more formal, but it is a beautiful hardback -- one of the nicest I've seen at that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This is an excellent text from one of the great figures in Orthodox spiritualty. The directness of the writing is effective and Climacus draws the reader closer to God through his own spirituality. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had made several attempts to get through this book but found it depressing. Then I read the beautiful Holy Transfiguration Monastery translation and finally was able to find this great work as a spiritual guide. Most of the depressing nature of Paulist Press version was in the mistranslation of several key terms used in the spiritual life. One simple piece of advice: Get the HTM version instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fulfilling work... wonting translation.","review":"While no objections can be made to this work itself (the 'Ladder' is one of the greater spiritual texts in human history), it is this particular translation of the text that must be criticised. This edition is wonting in the original tone of the Greek, little of which has been preserved in its English rendition.Perhaps more upsetting is the 'insertion' into the translation of much Western religious sentiment that is not apparent in Maximus' original Greek. This is fundamentally an Eastern text from an early period, and its translation 'into' a modern Western framework does a great injustice both to the text and to the reader.Only one star for this volume: those who are considering reading the 'Ladder' would do themselves much better to find one of the various other translations available, such as that by the Transfiguration Monastery, or HMC Press (the latter available hereon Amazon.com)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this toy for my son thinking it was a great alternative to the original \\"Operation.\\" Boy, was I wrong.

The story states that (at the time the balloon was noticed) \\"there was no wind.\\" The answer is based on the idea that there was no wind to blow the balloon from one yard to another and therefore it had to be planted there.

It a good 'monster'-type story, despite Anderson's horrendously forced dialogue. But it has almost no elements of Star Wars, some bordering on the line of obscenely un-Star Wars-ish. My biggest complain may be regarding Dorsk 82. The idea behind him was by no means bad, but Anderson's writing turns him into an annoying, craven fool. Sometimes I wished that Leviathan would just step on him and put the reader out of his or her misery.The art's good, although once again, not Star Wars-ish. It worked far better in the 'Tales of the Jedi' series than in the modern SW universe.You wants real 'Star Wars' comics, see something like the X-wing Rogue Squadron comics, especially 'In the Empire's Service' and 'Mandatory Retirement'. You want a story transplanted to the SW universe, read this. I'm grading this as a Star Wars comic, and as a Star Wars comic its just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Bad As It Gets","review":"1) This is the thinnest plot I have ever seen.

Nothing is ever explained, nothing makes sense, the characters repeat themselves constantly, and the whole point seems to be to make Dorsk 82, who never really shows up again anywhere else as far as I know, feel good about himself. And I'm not even sure he does that!2) Luke looks like He-Man on a bad day, and I originally thought Leia was some totally new character. Does Dorsk 82 have to be drawn *shaking* in every frame?

Read at your own risk!","review":"I first found this series in the library and I have since bought them all so I could introduce the books to friends.Literate and funny, the characters are both eccentric and believable. This is the first book of the series and a worthy read. Trouble is, you may be completely consumed with them until you've read them all. The series captures all of the nuances and eccentricities (good and bad) of small town life in general and Montana in particular.Unfortunately, I think the author has abandoned the characters and series, but I hope she returns to it at some point in the future. Until she does, enjoy them all (I think there are five books in the series)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Dancing or Get Out of the Way","review":"Louie DeVito compiled a dance album that won't win awards for originality or introducing cutting-edge grooves, but it does the job nicely. Tracks of note include Amber's \\"Yes\\" and Deborah Cox's \\"Absolutely Not,\\" both of which were remixed by Hex Hector. Dee Dee's \\"Forever\\" is bursting with an energetic thrust too infectious to resist, and Kim English also shines with \\"Every Day.\\" My only complaint is that many of these songs have already appeared on a dozen other compilations. For example, do we really need another collection that has \\"One More Time\\" by Daft Punk? This single is getting so overexposed, I'm starting to dislike it. Nonetheless, if you're looking for music for the gym or are looking to light things up at a party, 'Dance Factory\\" will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"DF is consistent","review":"DF usually puts out good albums.

The music is very Euro trash '96 from some of the cheese merchants in Ibiza that year.This cd has became my fastest coffee coaster - hope you don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up to my expectations","review":"First off, I like to say Louie Devito is one of my best dj's around. But this cd was not like I expected. Underground volume 4 was faboulous. I couldnt stop listening to it till now. The songs from this track sounds like other remixes. You might as well download the remix from the internet and make your own mix. To me it sounds like remixes from radios. It was too ordinary"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh...not another \\"mix\\" by this guy...","review":"Plain and simple...Louie Devito is a horrible DJ. He doesn't even deserve the title \\"DJ\\" or even the 1 star I was forced to give this poor excuse of a cd. Some decent songs are featured on the mix, but Devito makes it clearly obvious he doesn't know a thing about the art of beat matching and it would be nice if he mixed together more than the last three seconds of the songs once in a while. I have yet to hear any semi-decent albums from this guy, they're all very cheesy, and extremely commercial. Don't waste your time, or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"uhm...yippee?","review":"dood.... this is for beginners who are into techno/trance. this got so dman annoying, i will never want to see this cd again.

If you don't have it, check it out. Not every song is great but on the way to work today, tracks one through six gave me chills. It's been a long time since a CD did that. If you like this CD, be sure to check out anything on the \\"Neurodisc\\" label. Enjoy the music!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Skool","review":"Is this a joke? Just look @ the track list. These songs are so old the cheese is starting to smell. I saw Louie DeVito spin LIVE in Hartford, CT 2 weeks ago and he was one of the BEST shows i've seen. I thought this CD would reflect some of his new mixes. I've had every single track on this \\"new\\" CD for a long time. We want NEW stuff Mr. DeVito. To sum it up in one word ... Disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Louie DeVito Needs to give it a rest!!!","review":"This CD is an insult to music fans and DJ's around the world. Devito is the Back Street Boys of DJing. He simply takes top 40 dance tracks, puts them on a cd and calles it mixed. I am glad he saved New York the embarrassment of using the City's name in the tile as he did in the past. He is the poorest reflection of the whole NYC dance scene. He must have a great marketing team for people to by this [stuff]. This guy is a joke!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A flowing trip.","review":"A creative odyssey that breaks all the rules but somehow still works if you are open to something totally different. I can see how some could say that it is incoherent at times but if you really listen, everything fits beautifully and is actually quite mesmerizing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool idea, usually successful","review":"The concept behind this album is incredibly cool, but not so easy to pull off. One one hand, the results can be something like \\"Dream,\\" which really flows well and has a nice sound to it. On the other hand you could get ambiguous weirdness like \\"Infinite Cow,\\" which, I'll admit, I still sort of liked. Overall, I really enjoyed the quirkiness of this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Uninvolving","review":"\\"Dream\\" remains a great (if lyrically obtuse) number, but nothing else here quite matches up. The few times the music seems to take hold, the lyrics seem to intrude - on \\"You Create the Reason\\", they seem downright clumsy. This might appeal to some, but I guess I'm not in that some."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"The songs Dream and Planet unknown are very good songs. It's different from other songs that I've heard. The song Planet unknown seems to talk about time travel and a warning to us from the future that at the current rate that we're going at our planet will start dying off soon if we don't do something about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original -boring!","review":"I bought this Cd because I liked the single \\"Dream\\" and because Carl Stephenson was a part of Becks hit \\"Loser\\". I was pretty much dissapointed because the songs just drag on even though they are very original. I need something that will make me move (not move my hand to change the track). The only time I will be playing this CD is if I feel like listening to \\"Dream\\". Better luck next time Carl \\"loony\\" Stephenson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!!","review":"The title says it all - Math is Cool! Students love the fun challenges presented in this book.

I will not make that mistake again with any publisher/book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"Of all the McCaffrey novels I have read, this one is a total waste of time to read. This book is only worth anything to a compleatist fan who has to have every thing she's written.I have 1000+ SF/Fantasy books in my personal library and only a rare few are of such dubious quality that I have re-sold them to a used book store or amazon.com's Marketplace.....this book is one of those rare few.The plot is not well-developed, and quite contrived. It reads like something a grade school wannabee would turn into their teacher.....To me it seems that Kilgore Trout spent more time writing 'Venus On The Half Shell' (7 days BTW, and it's funny and good) than McCaffrey did on this piece of dreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it were longer","review":"I wish this book had been a full length novel -- with sequels!!! The book \\"Coelura\\" was so good,I couldn't put it down.I only wish that there had been more of it and that Anne McCaffrey had decided to make it into a series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characterization in under 80 pages.","review":"Although this is one of her shorter books, Anne McCaffrey creates a new world of body-heirs and womb-mothers very effectively. She maintains the intrigue and suspense from the opening words to the final pages. Although more could have been written about the central characters, The Coelura's terse style was a refreshing change from the verbosity present in most books in the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short story... too short.. could have been beefed up","review":"The girl is not being forced to marry, her father requests that she considers this suitor who turns out to be a real looser. She blows him off and decides to go hunting for awhile. Then she meets someone much more interesting, by accident. Given the fact I'm a major \\"ROWAN\\" series fan, Anne McCaffrey must have jotted this down in half an hour or less. It could have been so much more. Elsie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inmagative and entertaining, well worth your time!!!!","review":"I have read this book numerous times over a six year period and it still is wonderful enough to experience again years after. Definetly a worthy additon to McCaffery's extensive collection. In a colorful and furturistic world A.M. never loses site of of her characters. Lady Carrisa is a high born heiress who is struggling for independence and happiness. In her struggle for love she encounters a mysterious man and a secret that will forever change her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb product!","review":"This item is awesome! It opens easily with the zipper and will fit most carriers. We used it all last year with a graco snug ride. We live in Iowa, so we had to use a blanket over the opening when it got really cold. It was awesome for taking her in and out of the car. If you use the fleece part as the inside, the outer part is super easy to clean... our daughter spit up a LOT, and it just wiped right off. It is not super thick, I would say it is good as the only thing down to about 40 degrees or so. It stood up really well. I just gave another one as a baby gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So convenient","review":"- So much easier than trying to struggle with a coat/snowsuit- Fits my european brand car seat just fine- If my son is asleep when I get home, I can just unzip the cover to keep him from overheating, and let him finish his nap- I thought the nylon would be a little more like Gore-tex \\"wind-stopper\\" material, but it seems to keep the wind out just fine anyway- Overall, a great purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I had hoped...","review":"I got this cover after a child carseat inspector told me that the one I was using (the Bundle Me - which i love!) was not safe for the car seat and instead i should have one of these shower-cap type covers. I liked this at first, but now I notice that my DD turns her head and ends up underneath it - when she's fussing and i'm driving it makes me very nervous. I started taking it off once I get in the car. I miss my Bundle Me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!","review":"I wouldn't recommend this product. It's flimsy and not at all warm like I would have thought it to be. It also doesn't fit the Graco Snugride carseat tightly, so it \\"falls in\\" on the baby's face. I had an old no-name brand car seat cover that was much better. Too bad I let someone borrow it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I ordered this over the jj cole one because you did not have to put it under the baby... safer.

Its been quite useful for our newborn. If you are looking for something afordable for a carseat cover this is your product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very warm looking","review":"I guess kiddopotamus changed the design of this item. They used to make them in soft, thick fleece. Now it's thin and cheap looking. I think this would be good for protecting baby from a draft but definitely not good for warmth. You'd have to put a couple blankets over the baby inside to make sure he or she is warm enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I purchased this item right before it snowed and I'm so glad I did. It fit great on the car seat and it keeps my son very warm.I just loved it. No more trying to carry him and a bunch of blankets into the store.I wish I would of had this with my older children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conversation Starter for Small Groups","review":"I have read MacDonald's books in the past, and found them very thought provoking. This particular book is especially useful in Small Groups. The group I am currently leading reads the book together at the meeting, and discusses it as we go along. There are discussion questions in the back of the book, but we seldom get to them. One caveat; this book has undergone a few updates. Although the different versions can be used together, it is much easier (and less distracting) if all are using the same version. If buying it \\"used\\" this might be something to watch for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine's already in order. How about yours?","review":"If your world is topsy-turvy, this is a great read for you. I found it only so-so. For those who need some order in their \\"private world,\\" give it a read. For those who are plugging along just fine, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordering Your Private World","review":"This book is a must read for everyone caught up in busyness. It starts slow and the early chapters might turn off those with deep beliefs in striving to achieve - but read on. Everyone must set priorities that are realistic and in accord with one's gifts. Those priorities must (absolutely must) include family, spouse, and spiritual concerns. Chapters 9 and 10 are where the rubber hit the road for me, and I am using hindsight to make that judgment. Sixty to Eighty hour work weeks don't cut it and put me out of touch with God and family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homophobic and convoluted","review":"I give this book two stars for it's guidance in leading a life of accountability. I give this author no stars for being a homophobic who believes homosexuals are pawns and spawns of Satan as he so brutally quotes in his book! To say that homosexuals are possessed by Satan is about as good as the author saying he is the \\"source\\" of a great walk of faith. Mr. Mcdonald, care to share any of your skeletons with the buying public?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Awesome!","review":"If you are a Christian still trying to \\"find themselves\\" and need a little \\"fuel\\" \\"reassurance\\" \\"it's okay to be me\\" kind of push -- this is the literature for you!

This book crosses every barrier, every thought process, every reasoning mindset to the point of, \\"okay, I see myself.\\" Don't miss this blessing that has changed the lives of the Connecticut State Missionary Baptist Convention's \\"Commission On Women In Ministry\\" and is still spreading, one disciple, Rev. Tracye Colette Chisholm-Penn brought it to class and taught from it giving full credentials to it's author and oh -- how our lives have changed!

He's a master teacher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent life lessons","review":"I have read this book every five years for the past fifteen years, and find it exceptionally helpful each time I do. He offers advice from great accomplishments and failures of his own and others in history. He is well read, and inspires readers to be as well. There is much to be learned from those who have walked long and closely with the Lord. The wisdom he passes on is essential to living a full life in Christ. Great book. I loved this book as a young undergrad, and having reread it recently, I love it as a seminary-grad as well. If you ever feel burned out, overwhelmed, or imprisoned by your work or ministry, do read this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A helpful book","review":"I just finished reading the first edition of this book. I found it helpful. I appreciate his breadth of insight from the lives of many whom have gone before us. I would agree with the critics that it is disturbing that shortly after the publishing of this book, MacDonald reveled he had an affair. I found his treatment of the Bible to be light and not central to what he was saying.But all in all I was challenged. One example of how this book has pushed me is the personal assessment of one's outward orderliness as a benchmark for one's inward order. I think if you took one look at my man cave you would know I need to spend some time cleaning things up. I also appreciated his take on productivity and sleep. He encourages rest in his last chapter, but encourages hard work in pursuit of order in the other chapters. I think that is helpful.Rob[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful, helpful, Christ-centered","review":"This is a wonderful publication. Gordon MacDonald speaks from years of experience in his own Christian walk. His writing style is very approachable, and everything he says is relatable to a wide audience. This is not a \\"how to\\" book, but rather a picture of what he sees as an ordered private world. I highly recommend this for any Christian seeking more order and peace in their private lives, even if you don't feel the pressing need to re-order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Discipleship from the Inside Out","review":"This title is the second I've read by Gordon MacDonald, and I was so impressed that it certainly won't be my last. MacDonald approaches discipleship from a different perspective than most would do -- discipleship is not found in greater effectiveness for ministry, but in greater purpose for living. He doesn't tell the reader how to do what he/she is doing better, but to discover WHY it is being done. MacDonald calls believers to search their hearts, seeking godliness above busyness. This book is an excellent read for all Christians, but especially for church leaders and pastors. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Minute Solution","review":"This workout is great but is not for the beginner.

Similar to the Playstation version, Tony Hawks puts you in control with an aresanal of moves and tricks.

The gameplay is great and the graphics are awesome. This game is great for boarders and non-boarders. If you skate, the game is unblievably real, and the moves are great.

Anyway, the game is cool and it is definaley a buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is That Tony Hawk?","review":"Okay. This game ... If you think this game is good, play Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 and see what you think after that. This game lacks good graphics and doesn't have enough tricks to keep you awake. I mean, come on! One lip trick?! Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 has plenty of lip tricks, grab tricks, flip tricks, and specials. Plus, on Pro Skater 2 you have the ability to decide what tricks are performed for which button. If you are a true Tony Hawk fan, don't get this game. It will upset you to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPEND!!!","review":"Finally a skateboarding game for N64, and it's ...! This isnothing like the PlayStation version.

Everything's intact from the PSX version; they even have a move simulator(very cool indeed). However, although the gameplay is as smooth as a skipping stone, the music was apparently forgotten. This was the key to the PSX classic, and instead they have instrumental (mostly) versions of SOME of the songs. Indeed, I was dissapointed with that, but otherwise this is a great game. If you have DC or PSX, get those versions instead of this relatively weaker version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Fun One","review":"When it comes to the Nintendo 64, there are a few staples that you need to have in your collection. Any of the Tony Hawk games should be one of those titles. Basic controls and levels advanced enough to where you don't beat the game in 30 minutes, yet easy enough that someone can quickly learn the controls and learn to play fast. Great game to relive my past gaming experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"best game on the n64","review":"all you can say for this game is wicked its totally cool from warehouse to the streets of san fransisco its an all out radical game"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS GAME!","review":"I have always wanted to try skateboarding, but I was afraid I would end up lying at the bottom of a halfpipe bleeding to death.

I followed the instructions accordingly and the broth came out HORRIBLE. You could taste the \\"complexity\\" of the spices and a hint of fake beef, but the combination together gave the broth a \\"dusty\\" taste (for the lack of a better word) then leaves a slightly bitter after taste. I thought it was worse than the beef-flavored instant ramen broth.I tried again with some store-bought, low-sodium beef broth. Hopefully it would bring more \\"beef\\" taste to it. The broth came out overly salty and even more \\"fake-beef.\\" Terrible.I tasted the powder by itself and it does taste a little \\"dusty.\\" I think perhaps if you make REAL beef broth and use the powder instead of buying 5 different spices, it would be quite handy, but I'm not sure how to get rid of that \\"dusty\\" taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one box","review":"The web site descibe the quatity as 8*42, so it suppose to be 8 box of pantiliner, and each box contains 42 pieces.

See the little rubber feet on the corners? These actually suspend the cutter an 1/8\\" or so above the floor. Which causes the entire cutter to flex when the necessary downward pressure is applied. Which leads me to #2, the base. It's a very thin metal, about 1/16\\" +/- and worsens problem #1. #3 is the circle cutter. Novel idea and selling point but is effective only if your tile is made of clay...... soft clay. A decent starter cutter would be a Plasplugs or Hyde."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor quality, poor performance","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. I saw this as a closeout in a tool store and bought it because it was a traditional style with hole cutter. After I got it home and set it up, I messed up my first tile and that was enough. Score performance is poor due to binding rails and shifting tile, making the score line waver. Breaking ability is also poor with lots of flex in the base that causes the tile to break incorrectly.Overall, a very poor quality piece of junk that delivers poor performance.

Hedy Lamar is beautiful as ever and great at slinking and pouting around the tropical set. But, unfortunately for Hedy and for Walter Pidgeon, none of the characters or the plot are complex or compelling. Hedy's character is banal and evil. The young Brit is just an unsympathetic fool. Walter Pidgeon is given a little more to work with, but it doesn't save the film. The film is worth seeing, by the way, for the vision of Hedy in skin-revealing attire. Just don't pay much for the privilege."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Collection of Old Sexual and Racial Sterotypes","review":"\\"White Cargo\\" is a controversial 1942 hit that remains one of Heddy Lamarr's most popular movies. Set in 1910 Congo, Lamarr plays Tondelayo, a half-Egyptian, half-Arab temptress who seduces and antagonizes the white leadership of a British rubber plantation. At the time of its release, \\"White Cargo\\" conflicted with the Motion Picture Production Code's ban on miscegenation and filmmakers changed Todelayo's ethnic identity from black African in order to avoid code violations. Today, the film plays like a collection of old racial and sexual tropes that have long fallen out of favor and are often offensive to contemporary audiences. Tondelayo is not a well-developed character, but an erotic superficial cut-out whose exotic sexual power drives men to their ruin. Ultimately, \\"White Cargo\\" is a film about forbidden sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"beyond shock, this is disgusting art house cinema as its most excessive","review":"I wish I could find something positive to say about this film, because I will be labelled ineffably square if I didn't like it, but I am afraid that I cannot recommend this to anyone but the fanatic art house crowd. This is the kind of thing we saw in high school to prove we were cool, a license to adolescent snobbism.Is there a message? Is it just absurdist anarchism? Are we supposed to want to disrespect all order? You got me. Masquerading as avant garde, you get scatological re-birth, rape, any bodily function associated with dirt or sex mixed, basically. You get screams about about capitalism, show biz, communism, etc. It is simply bizarre and I did not care to seek deeper meanings. I did not enjoy any of this either, saw nothing redeeming in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely disgusting. Criterion should be ashamed","review":"This review is for the Criterion collection DVD of the film.Sweet Movie, directed by Dusan Makavejev, is one of the most controversial films ever released and contains explicit scenes of sexual fetishes which cannot be described here. The sexual content is so explicit and outside the mainstream, the movie is banned in the United Kingdom and many other countries.The film is about a group of people who go on journey down a river on a large boat and do various things. The first half of the film is not that bad except for the first 15-20 minutes. But the last 20 minutes of the film were so bad, I had to skip parts.The only reason I watched this film is because I watch every film Criterion releases on DVD.The special features are an interview with the director and a film scholar named Dina Iordanova. Also, actress Anna Prucnal sings a song featured in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, that really sucked.","review":"first, a little about me. i love things that are weird, original, creative, sexually explicit, subversive, and substantive.i was led to believe (from other amazon reviews) that Sweet Movie was worth seeing, if not owning. well, i bought it and was completely bored and unsatisfied. sure, there were a couple neat subtleties in that hour and a half, but mostly it was vague, nonsensical twaddle (with annoying singing)!why this is a Criterion Collection film, i have no idea. i own a number of Criterion movies and really enjoy them, but this is extremely crappy.Darrick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seems","review":"This movie is not as great or as shocking as billed.

Sweet Movie's political tone is sometimes shaded by overt displays of nudity, grossness and comedy, but pushing past all that you can see someone who loves his country, while hating aspects of it's ruling class. Watch this movie with an open mind to what it is trying to say. Don't just look at what's on the screen.Personally I enjoy Sweet Movie for it's over-the-top-ness. I enjoy the exploitation tactics used by the director to illustrate his points. If you cannot stomach outrageous displays, then stay away from this movie.

The writing is clean and in places, funny. I thought the ending was maybe unrealistically dramatic, but the novel was still satisfying as a whole.Parents especially will appreciate eight-year-old Emily's struggles to work out her place in the world post-divorce, and Bev's clever solutions for dealing with Emily's insistence that she'll only eat food the color that she is wearing.Of course, not once do the financial implications of giving up a big city corporate law career versus the difficulty of making ends meet as a lawyer in a tiny town come up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the agravation to me","review":"Jill Strathern is an attorney who catches her husband doing the nasty in his office.

I rather liked this story, and yes, there was one paragraph where I actually laughed out LOUD. Unrequited love, passion, anger, pain, sorrow, it's all in her story!

Upshaw shows grace and control without sounding as if she's being held back. This is a perfect genre for her unique voice.One of the things I love about Upshaw's voice is that it is not typical of most classical singers, and she is able to easily cross over into mor epopular styles. But this recording establishes her finess in the purely classical style as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, fervent Bach, but the Purcell songs are a bit prettified","review":"Amazon's reviewer seems to have zoned out on how Dawn Upshaw pronounces words, missing most of the musical value here. Her singing of the Bach cantata, 'Mein Herze schwimmt in Blut,' is very moving. She is deeply involved, and her voice extracts the deep reverence and religious passion that makes this music so great. I'm not as convinced by the Purcell songs, however. Upshaw has chosen some of the most famous, and set against great singers like Battle, Baker, and Ferrier, her rendiitons seem a little shallow and prettified. She's considerably more tuned in to Bach, which is good enough to make this a memorable CD, if not her very best. Things would be much improved if the conducting by the (totally uncredited) conductor weren't so limp."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and great recipes!","review":"I've had success with all the recipes I've tried thus far.

I wanted to send them back, but shipping for return would have cost almost as much as the glasses cost me originally. I gave two stars, because the glasses were great but unusable.

Pleasant looking, they would be fine for iced tea, or cocktails. Nothing wimpy about these glasses but you don't get the feeling they belong in a truck stop diner. I like them. Libbey seems to feel they are indestructible because they are packed and shipped in the flimsiest cardboard box with nothing to keep them from rattling around in their little compartments. Just one step up from a manilla envelope. So, it's amazing only one glass was broken in route. I tried to get them to send a replacement but got another entire carton.

For the price, top notch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle with care","review":"Received these glasses from our wedding registry. We choose them because we have children and thought the heavy base would be best to prevent tip overs. During the first year we had been using these glasses, we broke all but 4 (and I'm not holding out hope they will last another 6 months). The glass only needs to be gently tipped over or knocked against another item in the dishwasher and it is cracked or broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile","review":"I've broken two of these glasses in less than a month, most recently tonight when I picked up the larger glass full of milk and the entire bottom fell out.

Be careful with these glasses -- they may look like a substantial glass, but they're very delicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need to be thicker glass","review":"I have had them about 4 months now. They tend to break in half when I put them under the ice dispenser of my fridge. So you stand there looking at half a glass wondering where the hell the rest went. Sad yet kind of entertaining in a weird way as you never know when it will happen only that it will. 4 down so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Break Easily","review":"These are nice looking glasses, but they break fairly easily. We've had these glasses for 3-4 months, and in that time about 5 of the tall glasses have broken. They have either broken while being washed by slight banging against other dishes or by being tipped, etc. We have other glasses that have lasted us forever. These just seem to not be durable at all. Especially not recrommended for use with children. We very very rarely use the 8 small glasses. They just take up space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap price, expensive quality","review":"Bought these as my first set of everyday-use glasses in my first apartment. So far, I've had them for a few days, and I only have good things to say. For 20 dollars, I can't really imagine that you can get a better set than this. I'm surprised by the quality heft the glasses have - the bottoms are heavy and they feel much more expensive than they are. A simple, classy design means that they'll goes well in any kitchen or dining room. I don't imagine they'll survive if I drop one on a floor, but I don't expect that out of my glasses. If handled with reasonable sensitivity, I'm sure these glasses will give you more than your money's worth.The bottom line:- Simple, classy design.- Great heft; they feel much more expensive than they are.- The price is right. With free shipping, I don't imagine there's a better deal out there.

There are many playing levels and game options, the graphics are great and the natural backround sounds really add to the realism of the game. At about 1/2 the price of the 2007 version of the game, it's a real bargain at under $10. I was able to convert the course disc to a vertual disc on my PC hard drive using Alcohol 52%, which allows the game to run a little faster and is much more convenient than having to run the course disc from the CD/DVD drive.The only negatives are that the commentary from Gary McCod and David Faherty isn't always in sync with the shot that was hit and it would be nice to have some additional \\"name\\" courses included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Golfing Fun","review":"Major complaint is that competition while you are working your way up through the ranks is not very good.

Nice heavy bottoms will prevent most tip-overs. These glasses also come in the original manufacturer's box so you can give them as a gift and claim you bought them at some big department store! Packed well per Amazon, nothing was broken or chipped. I am very satisfied.Update 4-09Still love these, have not broken one yet!

There is some \\"flashy\\" steps at the end that can spice up the basic moves that are shown at the first half of the tape. The very beginning shows a dance routine to demonstrate what can be done with a Tango even though the more flashy steps are not taught in the video. Which is disapponting for the more advanced dancer but one can review the tape and disect the steps. I don't recommended this for someone that has no patients.

Great video, and pilates is a great way to keep in shape. Don't forget your cardio though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I didn't get this from Amazon, but it is one of my favorite pilates videos. This is great for beginners as she tells you alternatives but it's also good for someone who has been doing pilates for a little while and wants a new challenge. I have a few other 10 minute solutions pilates videos and none of them compare to this one. She goes rather quickly, so it was hard for me to keep up the first couple of times, but now that I'm used to it I'm thankful as I don't feel like I'm wasting time to listen to instructions. The arms section is still very difficult for me. She recommends using 1-2 lb weights but I just do the motions empty handed. The stretch section is a great way to either cool down or do a relaxing workout when you're really not in the mood for a heavy workout. She does a small warm-up at the beginning of each section, which is nice if you like to do them one at a time but she keeps them short so it doesn't hinder the workout if you're going through all 5 of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is great for all levels!","review":"OK - I think it is great for all levels - not everyone does. I am a beginner at Pilates and feel very comfortable with the instruction. It is super challenging and pushes your muscle groups to the limit, but you can actually feel yourself getting stronger and progressing. I LOVE LOVE LOVE that you can pick your own workouts and the DVD allows for a super transition between vs. other DVD where if you do 2 of the workouts you start all over form the beginning with warm up - this is seamless. I will be getting the rest of the 10 minute solution DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe I'm just no good at pilates","review":"Maybe I'm just no good at pilates, but about every other time I tried to use it, I hurt myself.

I have another Suzanne Bowen abs DVD that I absolutely love, so I immediately bought this DVD when I saw her on the cover. I love this DVD!

The exercises combine ballet and pilates movements and are completely different from those on Suzanne's other 10-Minute DVD. You can build a customized workout using any combination of the five workouts, focusing on upper body, lower body, abs, etc. The fifth segment is a nice stretch sequence that balances the workout well.Suzanne Bowen is a terrific instructor. She explains the importance of form while still maximizing each 10 minute set. This workout is best suited to intermediate or higher exercisers. I would particularly recommend it as a way to balance weightlifting workouts, as it tones the body without stressing joints and enhances core strength."},{"rating":"2","title":"great workout!","review":"This DVD is a great workout divided into 10 minute segments which provide complete toning and shaping of core areas, including tummy, butt and thighs, arms, and legs, as well as stretching. Easy to follow, and no extra equipment needed (except a light pair of hand weights, if you like). All 5 segments equal a perfect 50-minute workout. Over the summer, a group of us got together to exercise over our lunch hour, and this was our favorite DVD by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent workout","review":"LOVE Susan Bowen, I have 2 of her tapes.

I have lost 30lbs going to gym and doing cardio but I needed a seperate exercise for muscle toning. I bought this dvd a few weeks ago and finally started using it about 2x/wk in the last three weeks and I am very impressed with this dvd. The instructor is very charismatic and to the point with directions. The exercises are challenging but addictive; I can't stop with the first segment. I feel empowered when I'm done. I could already see my muscles toning up. I also notice that my posture has improved without trying. I also bought the other pilates dvd by ana caban, the beginners mat workout but I definetly prefer the 10 minute solution. It is more challenging and trains the entire body. A+++++ for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"overall, good","review":"I place myself at a medium level of fitness. I always do all workouts but like the structure of 10 minute workouts.

Mine worked well in my tests and is a bit louder than some. Decent value for the price, I think. This design is a bit different than most others and well suited for hanging on a tub or basin (or whatever) to prevent overflow. Can also be used for leak detection, but the wire is very stiff, so in some situations the simpler, \\"just sit it down on the floor\\" designs are easier to use.

It is not a robot at all. It is a remote control car that you place a little taped together carboard piece on top of. You punch out the cardboard, tape it up (the tape doesn't hold, so we hot glued and it still didn't hold)and stick it on top of a premade remote control car. It has nothing to do with building a robot. It's more like folding a paper airplane. It was a joke! My son has just finished an electronics kit and wanted to move onto building a robot. I didn't think it was going to be a real live walking and talking robot - but I thought he'd learning something about putting a robot together. Not true. I would not recommend this to anyone - unless you're looking for a remote control car (and in that case spend your money on a better one somewhere else).

As for the performance, the SFGMC is overall stunning with its sheer number of voices, but doesn't always follow the music as it's written. Considering that the music was commissioned by this chorus, I would consider that a flaw in technique. All the solos in this performance are dead on.

I especially like \\"I Come From Good People\\" and \\"Dance On Your Grave\\", and \\"Marry Us\\" in particular gave me goosebumps.Unfortunately some of the choral diction is unclear, and since a libretto is not included (a poor decision with a piece such as this), you're on your own.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Freaky green eyes - as good as Big mouth ugly girl?","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It was well written, though quite drawn out at certain parts. After reading Big Mouth Ugly Girl, this book slightly dissapointed me. I very much enjoyed Big Mouth Ugly Girl, and was highly impressed by Joyce Carol Oates work and her using ambiguity in the book. I was hoping that Freaky green eyes would be like that, but it was not. However, I did enjoy Freaky Green Eyes. Joyce Carol Oates portrayed the character of franky and her alter ego,\\"freaky\\", very well. The character of Freaky/Franky is a very understandable character, that you get to know through the book. Unfortunately, you might not always like her, and might, at times, become exasperated with her inability to see what is going on, but over all, I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy Fantastic Book","review":"When I bought this book, i was just expecting a normal teenager's family diffuculties.

This works great, is easy to install and fastened solidly even though the inside of my tub is slightly curved at the end where I wanted to install the bar. It arrived with a slight scuff on the top of the handle, but I was planning to cover that with some non-slip tape anyway, so I didn't care.

I was concerned with her ability to safely get into and out of the tub. The item was a very quick and easy install. No special tools or ability required.

An important part of having aging people around.Super product for such a reasonable cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I am gearing up for knee surgery and bought this item to help me in the shower. It clamps easily to the tub and is very sturdy. I like the fact that I do not have to install a permanent rail in my limited tub/shower space. An added advantage that I did not expect is that I can adjust the position of the bathtub bar in such a way that it will also help me to get up from the toilet, eliminating the need to buy toilet safety rails.

It easily slips over the side of the tub and is easily tightened with the oversize knob.

It is attractive and well built; it does what it claims and is easy to install and remove. It is slippery when wet and you might want to consider wrapping non-skid tape (we used silicone tape) to prevent wet / soapy hands from slipping off the grip.I only gave it 4 stars because in the other reviews and product information it was unclear about how it fits older tubs with beveled edges. It is not designed for and does not offer an adapter for beveled edge tubs. If the edges of your tub are NOT SQUARE you should not order it with the expectation that it will be as sturdy.If you are handy you can cut a shim to fit the space on the non-square side as a 'hack' support for the bar, but this is less than ideal and you are taking a risk no matter whether or not you can make it \\"fit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly metal, with rubberized pieces that really grip the walls of the tub. But slippery metal top.","review":"You can read the other reviews telling you about whether or not this bathtub bar will fit your tub and, if it will, how sturdy it is.I just thought I would mention that after buying the product, I decided that it was just too likely that, with wet/soapy hands, I might lose my grip on the device when getting out of the tub. So I purchased some bicycle handlebar tape and wrapped it around the entire metal handle. The particular handlebar tape that I used was this:Stella Azzurra Eleganza TapeYou could use other less expensive handlebar tape for the same purpose.By the way, I placed the bathtub bar (on the outside tub wall, of course) midway between the head and foot of the tub. I put it there so the device could be easily reached irrespective of whether I am getting up from a bath or stepping out after a shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't fit","review":"I agree with other reviewers. Despite description, did not fit our tub. We had to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy but check your tub","review":"I ordered this because it looked like the sturdiest product of its type and was not disappointed. It seems to be well made and when properly installed should support the weight suggested.However, the description doesn't indicate that the clamp won't hold if the sides of your tub aren't straight. The sides of my tub slant downward for about 6 inches before becoming vertical. As a result my husband could not find any way to tighten the clamp so it wouldn't slip.If you have a straight-sides club, this product should be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.

It's awful if you're making a lot of sushi at once. I prefer larger sheets so I can roll and cut many pieces of sushi. I will not be buying this product again because of this. It was however delicious Nori and good quality rice and very quick to do. It's just no good if you're looking to make more then 10 pieces, plus that causes it to actually take more time then it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"something bad happened here","review":"The salt had separated from the rice, or something weird happened to this product.

I won't order this ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sushi your way","review":"It's a quick, fun way to have sushi your way. You put the 'stuffing', anything you like into the roll.

Granted it is very sticky, but they do call it sticky rice now don't they? Throw some cucumber or something else in, and you have sushi. For best results, spring for some real nori, such asEden Sushi Nori, Toasted Sea Vegetable, 0.6-Ounce Packets (Pack of 6), as what's included are small strips of very thin seaweed."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best meal on the go!","review":"I was a little skeptical about this, after many bad microwavable rice meal experiences, but this was really good!

Planning on keeping them at home, work, and in my backpack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll-----the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it (commonly called sushi vinegar)--------the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling-------I have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant---------the soy sauce is OK but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sushi"},{"rating":"1","title":"No easier than regular sushi, just more packaging","review":"I suppose if you're really on the go and feel like packing all your sushi innards and taking them to work is easy, this could be helpful... But the tiny seaweed paper trips were too small, and it really didn't feel like it was much easier than just doing regular sushi. There is a lot of packaging for all the little pieces.I can see how it could be fun for a bunch of little kids to make a mess, but not for two adults to sit down and have a meal together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sushi Making One Bite At A Time","review":"I purchased this product (3 packs) to make Sushi for our family of four. The Nori or Seaweed Wrap is very small, a little less than 2\\" x 4\\" which makes it very hard to make a simple California Roll with crab, cucumber, and avocado. Once rolled it wasn't quite big enough to cut, but also made a much bigger single piece of sushi. The sticky rice was exremely sticky and we had more rice than what the 10 sheets of Nori could take. Don't recommend for family dining unless your family is looking for a snack and some sticky fun, however, may be perfect for the single person with time to play or only likes a single item in their sushi.

It's well paced, well played, well sung. Jonas Kaufmann is an ideal Tito. His voice is not only beautiful and flexible, it's also ample, retaining warmth and sweetness when he sings out. The character of Tito is too good to be true, but Kaufmann makes him intense, noble, and beliveable. Vesselina Kasarova is riviting as Sesto. Her voice is gorgeous and multi-colored, her technique exquisite, her immersion in the role complete. If you think great singing-acting expired with Callas, this DVD will change your mind. Liliana Nikiteanu as Annio, Malin Hertelius as Servilia, and Gunther Groissbock as Publio, have luscious voices and dramatic talent. Nikiteanu is particularly touching. The only disappointment here is Eva Mei as Vitellia. Her slightly tart soprano suits the character's vengeful moods, but her lack of tonal warmth deprives her great aria of pathos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help!","review":"This book was of extreme help to me in many places.

However, season 5 is a huge disappointment so far. I think the writers lost their touch. The episode with the film crew following the police around was just stupid and the Captain's fawning over them downright embarrassing. Monday night's episode with the Santa also left much to desire.

Mostly because of the interplay between the 4 main characters. Eachshow is an enjoyment to watch but I had to catch up on the story line.

The graphics are mediocre, while the playability is absolutely horrible. I took this game back and exchanged it less than an hour after buying it. It ranks among the worst military shooters I have ever played along with the Delta Force games, the Clancy games(The Rainbow Six series that is), and others. Don't waste time or money on this ... game. It's disappointing that no one seems to be able to come up with a good 1st person military adventure shooter game. The only two decent ones I've seen recently were Medal Of Honor and Return To Wolfenstein. Again, don't waste money on this awful game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible...Major let-down","review":"This was the worst game I have ever played before.

Complete waste of time and money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME","review":"I hate this game so much I have to write another review. All these people who love this game must have been living in a cave for the last 5 years playing Pac Man. Thats about where this game stands- The graphics are so absolutely horrible I can't bear to think of it. The game is full of terrible, terrible voice overs and cheesey little cut scenes, and your soldier runs like he just learned how. On top of that you have voices of other characters that were rendered by Speak And Spell. The developers had a good idea, but failed at their attempt. The quality just isn't there. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY- You were warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best....","review":"I have all of the Rainbox six games and I thought I would give this one a try. I am running 98SE, 1.4 gig Athlon, 512 DDR, Sound Blaster 5.1 live and Nvidia Mx400 64meg tv out card. I also have cambridge soundworks fps2000 digital sound w/sub. This is one of the best games I have ever played. The graphics are superb. You can actually see and hear the rain (with EAX). Thunder etc.. The game runs better with more of the \\"goodies\\" like I mentioned above, but will run on less(of course). I recommend this game to anyone into 1st person shootem up/tactical games. You have the ability to Drive vehicles and fly choppers, command squads etc. If you can think of it you can do it in this game. This game is so much fun(Difficult/Hard, The AI seems to sense your where abouts - I recommend stealth whenever possible) that you may end of running late for work or school when you start playing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bugs","review":"The game is fantastic as for the idea and implementation,but techically it has two seriuos drawbacks:1. It crashes on some single missions (blue screen or even reboot sequence starts on it's own).2. Sound - group leader commands are doubled sometimes, sounds direction may be indictinctive sometimes and there are loud distortions from time to time.Generally it's quite heavy, but it's fun even not in the largest resolutions.Reality level is very high. And I mean not the how the houses look, but characters behaviour, how you see the enemy, weapons performance. For instance you have to reload you weapon deliberatly when your magazine is empty, the game doesn't do it for you and you may get stuck in front of enemy pulling your trigger over empty mag if you don't keep in mind you ammo situation.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serving in the Canadian Army","review":"This game is as real as it gets. Although is U.S. army and I don't know very much about it. I can be a U.S. soldier in this game and learn about the U.S. army. This is the best combat sim ever. 6 stars out of 5. A gotta get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS GAME","review":"My roommates have basically written me off as far as going out is concerned lately. I really got into this game, and played it almost every night after work for about a month. Read the other reviews for the details, but this game is exactly what a game should be, FUN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Realistic, but clunky at times","review":"I appreciated all of the details - realistic weaponry, transportation, missons, etc.. However, the graphics are awkward at times - trees and shrubs look very 2-dimensional. The textures on the figures are good, but their motions seem stiff.Last, the realism (like getting killed in one shot) is welcome, but can get tiresome. It should be a game after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too Buggy","review":"I was quite excited about Operation Flashpoint after playing the demo. It seemed the most realistic portrayl of warfare yet on the PC HOWEVER, after a failed installation I went to various websites attempting to find a soloution. I read through 30 pages of people expressing problems with the patches, installation, textures and various other features of the game. I am sure that for those of you who can install it, it will be nice however, check out the...to see what the people who have problems are saying. I would not recommend a purchase of this game until you can be certain the bugs are fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME!","review":"Reasons to buy this game.1. If you like a game that is FULL of bugs, such as graphics disapearing, men walking through walls, game locking up.Reasons not to buy this game.1. If you like 1st persons shooters, this game is the WORST one that I have ever played.2. The controls are HORRIBLE. The mouse moves very jerky in this game.The reason I bought this game was because of all the good reviews I read on this site. This makes me think that the makers of the game were the ones writing the reviews. I wasted 40 dollars on this game, and I can not even play it (because it is so buggy). I have a nice system Athlon 1600, 512 MB Ram, 64 Radeon card, so I know that the problem is not my machine.I am writing this so that I can save someone the frustration of spending good money on a worthless coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad all the way around","review":"I guess (RTCW) has ruined my expectations of what games are suppose to look like. Flashpoint is a poor game. You can run through trees and buldings. Graphics are weak to say the least. SLow response time on moving and you over run where you want to stop. Gun sights suck and you get killed with one shot but need half a clip to kill them. Save yopur money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dog is still a dog","review":"This game is like going on a blind date. Your friends tell you that she is cute. You talk to her on the phone, and she seems really nice. Then you pick her up, and she's a dog. Shallow, well maybe, but still true. It is a major letdown.This game was the same for me.1. Graphics are not up to par with current titles in the same genre.2. The radio comms are horrible. I can't listen to them for very long before I shut down the game.3. The voice acting (and scripting) is LAME.My final verdict. I should have checked out the demo. And as for my last blind date, I should have demanded a photo.Someday I will learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST A NOTE","review":"RUN, BUY IT NOW! So far OFP is the most complicated game i've seen. Obviously, in the point of a game developer, it is complicated. Combine all those nice shooting games and drama, that's Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis!HINT: This game is not just a fancy shooting game...like Quake! You don't spend hours playing this game jumping like an idiot frog! Serious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"This is one of the best games ever! It is amazingly realistic. If you are shot in the chest or head good-bye. Leg: limp or have to crawl. Arm: lets just say it's going to take a few shots to bring a guy down. The enemy AI is great also. They throw grenades, target officers not grunts, and have very keen eyes. The single player missions are incredible! My favorite is when you land on the beach and have to capture a airport. It's ... hard, but very fun. Anyone who likes FPS should buy this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As A Final Note...","review":"I've already reviewed this game, but I just have to say this was true computer entertainment! The entire game played out almost like a movie. It was so incredibly dramatic, I'm having a hard time believing this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, bad support","review":"This game is very nice. Quite fun. Not enough missions in the campaign. I dont know how cool the multiplayer support is yet though because I cant get any of the upgrades to install. Every time I try to run the upgrades it asks for the cd, yet the cd is in the drive. Oddly the game itself works just fine, you'd think they could write an upgrade that can check the cd-rom drive too. Anyway, beware the upgrades might not work for you.. I'd write to their support to see what the statistics are on this sort of problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, trouble with patches","review":"The game has been very fun and intense to play. The main problem I have is with patches for upgrading the game. I think the problem is with my motherboard. If you use Windows 2000 and have a motherboard with a Via KT133 chipset, make sure you patch your chipset correctly. I cannot install patches because files were damaged during the game installation due to my chipset. Some levels crash during game play because of this problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best FPS's i've ever played!","review":"This is game is amazing, you can play it over and over again without getting fed-up with it. Also, the learning curve is only about 30min to an hour (depends on how much you play Videogames) also the graphics are great. You can see your hands steer the cars, and your feet press the accelrator (does anyone use the brake in videogames?) The best of the game is the realism, remeber when (with enough shots from a pistol) you could take out a tank in a game (delta force), in this game if you don't have a rocket launcher you run like hell cause you'll be dead in a matter on seconds if you take on a tank. This is just one example of the realism in this awesome game. A MUST BUY FOR MILITARY FREAK OR FPS FAN!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"... Served In The Armed Forces","review":"This is the MOST REALISTIC COMBAT SIMULATOR ever made. I spent 6 months in the Persian Gulf with a Marine Rifle Battalion, we were the 3rd Unit to enter Kuwait City, and contrary to CNN and all the critics, it was pretty hairy. This game comes as close as a computer game can come to pure realism. There are 40+ add-on missions to the demo, which allow you to explore all facets of the Simulator. From Armored Combat to Squad Tactics.As for James Cope, you do know you can remap all the controls brainiac. No need for Star removal.THIS GAME RULES!!Semper Fi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it from me, I've played this one for hours on end....","review":"This game is very realistic. You won't have 54 guns to choose from that you're carrying around at all times. Tanks won't always explode when you shoot them. The enemy won't stand out in the open and wait for you to shoot him, and he won't hesitate to pop you from 400 yards without a scope. I've read about every review for this and other war games, and there's definitely a divide between people who like realism and people who like carnage. If you're into unabashed carnage, shooting thousands of rounds every ten minutes, and picking up health kits that restore you to full health so that you can take another 50 bullets in the chest and still run around, then this isn't your game. If you're into military tactics, thinking on the go, and exploring several military roles in a single campaign, then this game is for you. Make sure you stick to what you like, and you'll never feel like you wasted your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Shocked","review":"I'm surprised to find good reviews for Operation Flashpoint. I played the demo and just from the game play this game stinked. Maybe I'm just spoiled with Half-Life's Counter Strike and SWAT 3, but the game play was very poor. Graphics weren't anything special. Kind of reminded me of Delta Force, which is a fun, but outdated first person shooter. Maybe you'll like this game. I recommend getting the demo first to test the game play. After all what good is a game if it has good graphics and bad game play? But this game in my opinion had neither. ;D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good game","review":"first off i am not one of these people who get easily discouraged, However with that said i could not even fishn the game cause it was no fun.

I expected this book to have a lot of information on charmed, behind the scenes stuff, and to have all the spells that they said in each of the episodes. There was some behind the scene type stuff and like 5 spells. It was more for a beginner in witchcraft explaining what certain ingredients are for and where and when to do witchcraft which I didn't expect so much of. I also didn't expect it to be so old, it only features 2 seasons of the charmed show. Now there are 7 seasons, I thought it would have been more updated, it doesn't even have Paige in it!

I am a great lover of the show and I fill this book is not worth the money I paid for it! And would advise others not to waste you money on this book, I wish I hadn't!

It reminds me of Daily Show's \\"America: The Book\\" and is of almost equivalent quality in its writing. The book leads you on a \\"teaching course\\" about how to become a tyrant. It's both witty and wise, and I laughed outloud quite often. A bonus is short history lessons about world-famous tyrants. The drawings are amusing too. It's considerably better than \\"How to Be A villain\\" which I read lately, although unfortunately not as visually attractive (thought the drawings are pretty cute- they should have reconsidered the cover though, \\"How to be A Villain\\" had a cover that screamed \\"pick me up!\\") All in all I think this book deserves more success than it probably had.

I would recommend it for someone who suffered a foot injury and needs to be off it for a while (like myself), but not for disabled/special needs people. It assembles together in minutes and does what it's supposed to and it only costs $30. It's best used in a shower so if you're buying it for a tub, measure accordingly allowing for arm room and stability. Also keep in mind if your tub has an upward curve that would make this wobbly. I'm about 70 kg (well under the bench limit) so I can't comment on the weight capacity, but it holds me up fine.If you are elderly or need it for a disabled person, don't buy this bench- look into commercial quality equipment (like hotels use). It will cost more, but will be immensely safer."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I bought it so I could bathe while recovering from surgery.

(3.5/5)4)Spinning the Wheel = A mellow song. Nice flow to it. Not bad (3.5/5)5)It doesn't really matter = Another mellow song. Kinda repetitive. Okay a lot!! Not my favorite (2/5)6) The Strangest thing = pretty song (4/5)7)To be forgiven = slow, nice song 3.5/5)8) move on = a little different, jazzy (4/5)9) Star people = faster pace, not too funky but nice (4/5)10) You have been loved = kinda like jesus to a child (4/5)11) Free = no lyrics (4/5)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 'miserable' CD","review":"Bought this CD when it came out and like it just as much now as then. Really like the sense of melancholy about it. It's clear George is quite sad and bitter at this point in his life and if you're feeling down, this is really soothing.

Included are the upbeat songs like \\"FastLove\\" and \\"Star People\\", as well as the slower and moving ones such as \\"You Have Been Loved\\" and \\"Jesus To A Child\\". I also enjoy \\"The Strangest Thing\\" and \\"To Be Forgiven\\". Even though George has been a star for 20 years now, I still feel he is slightly underrated as an artist.

The intelligent Jesus To A Child, the first single released, is an underrated masterpiece. The sultry dance track Fast Love, another single which charted pretty well on both sides of the Atlantic, is one song that shouldn't be missed on a George Michael greatest hits compilation.

Therefore, you have to flip through every single resume to find the industry or position you are seeking. Not user-friendly at all!

I think in retrospect that this had something to do with the elusive \\"chemistry\\" problem. For example, while tracks like \\"Starve\\", \\"On my way to the cage\\" and \\"Neon\\" rock hard, tracks like \\"Thursday afternoon\\" and \\"Inhale/exhale,\\" while good, seem a little out of place (and character) for Rollins.

The other one that I bought started to exhibit the same \\"lo\\" issue even though a humidity gauge that I had said it was 65%.

Yes, haier produces junk. I will add this; they don't honor their warranty obligations, and if their customer service weren't a run-around, it would be non-existent. My Haier dehumidifirer died before its warranty period was up, and I followed Haier's instructions for intiating a warranty replacement. It has been a month since they received the package of items they requested, and they still haven't shipped a new unit.

Still seemed to run, with lights and noise but in fact it was collecting no water and we were collecting a lot of humidity and mold in our summer home basement in Wisconsin. I called for warranty only to be advised that since it was a year old they would be happy to pony up some miserable parts but that I would have to pay for the service ie there is in effect no warranty because the cost of service is likely to be greater than the cost of replacement. SO no more Haier of any sort for me.

I was so surprised by the excellence of the recipes that I am in the process now of asking my family to give me other cook books from the Cook's Illustrated \\"Best Recipe\\" series for Christmas.

Surprisingly, she was just as insightful in this area! She really has deeply considered the spiritual significance of biology, and her insights were inspiring and refreshing for me. She doesn't over-extend herself either; even as someone with a world-class education in philosophy and religion I found no weaknesses in her thought (and that is very, very unusual).Whether you are depressed by or afraid of science and naturalism, or if you are in love with them, this is a beautiful, profound (yet simple) book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, nothing new here","review":"Disappointing, nothing really new here.

Pediatrics is one of the clerkships for which Case Files is more suited. Unlike some others, pediatrics requires both a detailed knowledge of clinical topics, as well as solid memorization of things like vaccination schedules and developmental stages. I found that I relied on Case Files in pediatrics significantly more than in other clerkships because I could flag pages for quick reference or memorization when I had a free moment.

At the time, I had no idea they had 2 previous independent releases but from what I hear this album is a revamped version of \\"The Blood Splat Rating System\\" for major label release. Powerman were definitely at their prime opening for the likes of Ozzfest 97, Primus and Limp Bizkit before taking over headlining duties once \\"Tonight The Stars Revolt!\\" was released. If you were to start listening to this band, I would think the time has passed since most of their career gave way to commercial pressure.

I thought \\"Where's the originality? Where's the stuff that made them so cool before gone?\\"Then, last night, I saw them live playing with Pantera.Oh my God. I was so blown away, I appreciate the new album a lot more now, but by no means as much as I love this album. The funk and drive of \\"Neckbone\\", \\"Tokyo Vigilante #1\\" and \\"Car Crash\\" are all amazing. I think I spent all of today chanting \\"Tokyo!

I was deeply disappointed at the result.Although the musicians gave good performances and the sound quality is better than 95% of the reggae and ska albums I have heard, the album is spoiled by poor lyrics and terrible singing.Mr. Lloyd should have allowed the musicians some room for improvisation and kept his mouth shut.

We get to see specific outcomes of events never fully disclosed during the series.There were a few new characters introduced but the development of the regular cast was great. Captain Sisko's development and the insight into his choices I felt were completely in character. General Martok showed new depth into his character but having read the two part series by J. Hertzler, am not sure of some of this character's actions.Overall, a wonderful read and I enjoyed pushing through it quickly.

Hope to hear more from this bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to your CD collection!","review":"This CD was recommended to me by a friend -- I usually don't buy CDs of artists that I don't know much about, but I'm sure glad I got this one!

The performances are simply astounding. This CD set is a must-have for any fan of RENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Day But Today!","review":"Announced today, June 1st will be the final show for this production. I have to tell you, this show, even after 12 years, still hits home and is as entertaining as ever. This album is amazing, but on stage it's mesmerizing. If you haven't seen it, make a trip to NY just to see. You can get great seats as the theater is small and even nose bleeds are good seats. I just brought my 29 year old friend and her 22 year old sister to see it last Sat (1/10/2008) and they fell in love with it.Seriously, don't miss it! There is no day but today people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SHOW EVER!","review":"Ok, so maybe I'm more than a little biased. But Rent's got me hooked like a fish and I can't get free. I haven't stopped listening to it since I got it. It's great. Jonathon Larson was a brilliant man. It's too bad that he had to die so young. And before RENT even opened! Talk about horrible timing! RENT is filled with hope and dreams, with the kind that makes you want to fulfill your own goals. I know that I for one will take from RENT that you should live each day as if it were your last. \\"No other road, no other way, no day but today.\\" And if any of you don't have this CD, buy it! I highly recommend Jon's other show, Tick... Tick... Boom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is amazing","review":"I got Rent for Christmas, and I truly have not listened to anything else since. It captures things that anyone, regardless of color, sex, etc can relate to. It makes you laugh, cry, and sing along. I highly reccomend it. It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"This is one of my favorite musicals. This show has a beautiful message, and deep characters. It's also great for its ability to speak to the current times.

The music and the messages in the music are amazing!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Brodaway CD Out There","review":"Rent is the best Broadway C.D. out there. It has a wonderful variety of sounds. My favorite song has to be \\"Without You\\" followed by \\"Halloween.\\" If you like good rock and roll and a lot of emotional moments you HAVE to buy RENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE!!","review":"This is the best CD that I have ever owned. I saw the play in New York City, but after getting the CD, I realized that anyone could by it and by reading along, follow the songs. The songs were what made up the play so buy it, turn it up loud, and enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its good, but not fantastic","review":"i work a lot in a local community theater, so i've naturally heard this more than anyone who doesn't own it possibly can. this soundtrack is the musical equivalent of a well meaning pop band; the messages are about as subtle as a sledgehammer, but the melodies and lyrics are catchy. this music is not in the least bit challenging, but serves well as a guilty pleasure. none of this applies, however, to the \\"what you own\\" song. i'd be the first to admit to america's numerous problems, but that song is the most bland and stereotypical protest song i've ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rent (1996 Original Broadway Cast)","review":"Perfect combination of rock, musical elements and deep meaning!!Everybody can find something in this album that they will like!Rent is going to bewitch you!

I enjoy just being weird, belting out 'Over the Moon' and 'Take Me or leave Me'. My new ambition is to play Maureen or Mimi when I get older. If you like rock, getting into trouble, and just plain having fun, you greatly enjoy this CD. You have to have the tolerance and a mature mind though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug self-satisfied and trite.","review":"When I first bought this CD I loved it and I listened to it over and over again. Now I can't stand the thing. Can't stand any tune in it. We're cool. We're artists. We got AIDS. So what? I'm sorry that the writer died because there is talent there, but after the hype and the fact that its not Andrew Lloyd Weber wears off, it's a fairly anethesized bit of fluff. It all sounds like Bryan Adams.Good to see as a musical, but don't buy the CD unless you want to hate the characters.Did anyone else notice that that \\"one glorious song before I die\\" that Mark sings to his dying love is the worst of the bunch?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A stinker","review":"I love Broadway shows, but this one just ain't my cup o' tea. Overall very dull and overwrought. Extremely unmelodic. I saw the production a few years ago, and it was perhaps the most endless evening of my life. Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred HOURS long."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 90's classic.","review":"Yeah, we did go crazy over this musical. Great songs, cute Village kidoes singing, drinking, cursing, rubbing...oh, u know how it goes.Good classic, romantic HIV-positive love story.But, itz like the Leon-goat-beard: stuck tight, way back in 90's! A decade is enough to make me feel .... listening to the songs.Of course, if u r a fresh-on-Broadway, please enjoy. They're still playing around Times Sq anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"I have yet to understand what all the hype is about. This musical has nothing but forgetable songs. This is not true Broadway theater. It reminds me of something from off-off broadway. Maybe it should go there and stay. It tries to compete with the rock attitudes of hair, and Jesus Christ Superstar, but fails in comparison. If you want true Broadway music, try Cabaret, Miss Saigon, or Jekyll and Hyde. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly missable.","review":"Emotional claptrap and cheap melodrama masquerading as deep philosophical thought. The main characters for whom we are supposed to feel such empathy are all whiners who could easily go home to Mommy and Daddy while the backdrop consists of the homeless and real outcastes who would all have fascinating stories to tell. The music is either annoyingly raucous or insipid. The plot is muddled and uninteresting. There are some clever touches that put moments of spark into the thing, but in general, I think it should just be put to rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry...just dull","review":"I can't help it. I have tried and tried and I just find it boring. Dull. And not near as clever as people have raved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent? Is it the first of the month?","review":"May god protect us all from the day when \\"Rent\\" is at the top of the charts. It will be a sad day for musicals and music in general. There are some things necessary to a good show-good music, decent dialogue, people who have some idea what they're doing... \\"Rent\\" fails on all accounts. The music is sloppy, the dialogue is horrendous, and don't get me started on the performers. It is my theory that \\"Rent\\" derives its popularity from the fact that it differs in almost no way from the hideous popular music being written today. For the interest of not being stoned to death by the \\"Rent\\" lovers I am no doubt offending, I end my rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's all hope that's not the way musicals are heading...","review":"I got this CD Set quite cheap in Germany (approx. 10$) and I have to say: It's not worth more. Whatever this is, it is most definitely not a musical in the classical sense. If you are fed up with Les Miz, Phantom etc. then get something like 'A new brain', 'Ragtime', 'Side Show' etc. but not 'Rent'. The 'Voice Mail' parts really get on my nerves. This music has been put together for the MTV Generation to get them into musical theatre. Sondheim (worst composer ever) in the 90's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"RENT rocks","review":"Rent is one of the best musicals of all time. The vocals on this soundtrack are amazing. Idina Menzel although not haveing as many songs as other characters still gives an amazing performance as one of the best actresses around today. All of the characters share their feelings with the audience and the audience can feel their pain, love, and full gamut of other emotions. Their friendships and heartaches can be related to by audiences of all ages and places around the world. This is a must have CD for any broadway lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I was blown away by the modern-day take on Puccini's \\"La Boheme\\". RENT has an inspiring plot, clever lyrics, and a talented, energetic cast. The choreography in the show is just great, especially in \\"Tango: Maureen\\" and \\"La Vie Boheme\\", but the CD is definitely worth listening to.I will admit, however, that at times it was a little uneven. For example, the entirety of ACT 1 takes place on a single night, where ACT 2 follows the events of the next year. Despite that, this CD is definitely worth buying, and RENT is still the best musical I have ever seen.VIVA LA VIE BOHEME! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rentfanatic","review":"If you ever see a Broadway play in your life you must see RENT. I have seen it 3 times and can go 10,000 more times. It is so catchy. I went in October almost 5 months ago and bought the cd with every song on it and I cannot stop listening it is excellent.

I love listening to the songs. There is always something new that I didn't hear before and I really love it. People who did not like this show obviously does not appreciate musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern masterpiece","review":"I don't understand how someone can turn an opera (Puccini's \\"La Boheme\\") into an astounding modern-day musical about AIDS, homosexuality, and struggling in life, but Jonathan Larson has managed to do it. Besides having a deep, thoughtful, and interesting storyline, the music in the show is incredibly well done (Mainly \\"La Vie Boheme\\", \\"Life Support\\", \\"Season of Love\\", \\"Christmas Bells\\" and \\"Sante Fe\\" ) Outside of the music, the overall message of living life to its full potential, and never forgetting that there really is \\"No Day But Today\\" is really powerful. It's hard to sum up this entire show in a paragraph, so go listen to some samples, or download some of the songs. Then go and buy it. It's a one of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Engrossing","review":"This is the Cast Recording of the best musical to come around in the past 2 decades, the show that resurrected that one little place called Broadway, and the story, music, and themes that reflect life as many see it.I can not sing enough praises about this show (Granted, the show and the recording are two different items, but you get my drift). I cannot find enough rooftops to shout from, or enough pages to rant about RENT. Everybody, regardless of background or predispositions, must expiriance or at least hear this. It desearves a place on the CD and tape racks of everyone from Paris to Wyoming. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"the music is amazing!","review":"i love this cd, i think this might be my favorite score. Favorite songs are \\"One Song GLory\\", \\"Take Me or Leave Me\\", and \\"La Vie Boheme\\". \\"Over the Moon\\" and the voicemails are hilarious. i would recommend seeing the show first, though. i enjoyed the music a whole lot more after i had seen it; it's easier to understand the story and the characters better."},{"rating":"2","title":"RENT is the Best","review":"When I first heard RENT, I couldn't believe that it was a Broadway musical.This is the first musical that i actually stayed awake through out the entire thing without falling a sleep and the plot line was just wonderful.

It is a must own for broadway and RENT fans! The music is great, the story is great, and this CD is great. The music is very catchy, and has many styles built into it.

RENT HEADS RULE!~"},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE MY WORD FOR IT........","review":"You don't have to be a Broadway fan to thoroughly enjoy RENT. It speaks to everyone, no matter your age, race, sex, religion...it doesn't matter. Every single person is capable of learning something important from this musical: life is short, so make the most of it. The voices and lyrics combined capture the poignant urgency of its message. It's such a shame Jonathan Larson never got the chance to witness how his music changed the world. It's imperative that you purchase this double cd set. I listen to it everyday, 24/7, and I NEVER tire of it. NEVER. The eclectic songs will satisfy anyone's taste in music. If you're in New York, make it a point to see RENT. If not, get thee to NYC, or at the very least, catch it on tour. You're sure to regret it if you don't see it. After all, there's no day but today."},{"rating":"2","title":"This musical and its music are life-afirming, inspiring...","review":"If you haven't heard this musical yet, I urge you to do yourself a favor and purchase it, from Amazon, of course. If you've heard the music but haven't seen the show, don't pass up an opportunity to do so at whatever price. My wife & I live on a shoestring budget, and while I will never get back the $120 I spent to see it, the passion and beauty I fealt can never be taken away. Viva, la vie, Boheme!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My God!","review":"This CD is orgasmic. Favorite song: I'll Cover You (Reprise). Oh my dear lord! I about fall over everytime I listen to it.

You can close your eyes and listen to it and just feel like you are right there watching the show!!! I totally recommend this CD!!!! Jonathan Larson is a genius!!!! (he has a good first name too!) You have to get this CD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, it depends!","review":"I don't like the score of this musical very much, and I was kinda shock that people regard this as one of the best scores ever written in a musical. That was not true, at least for me!!! Most of the songs are dialogue driven, meaning most of the songs are actually just conversations with melody having lots of plots. Even the trademark song of the musical Seasons of Love isn't as catchy as the title suggests, you'll have to listen to it for a while to appreciate the melody. Although I have to admit that the lyrics were great, I just wish they were put in a nicer and quieter melody. Everyone seems to shout!!! If you like musicals like Miss Saigon and you wish to stick with that genre, I strongly not recommend this one, since the music are mostly r and b, and rock opera!!! But if you still wish to see for yourself the fuzz about this musical, I suggest to download first some of the songs from the CD, then decide! Grade: B-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsensical Mish Mash","review":"I had high hopes with all the hype that this cd set would be extrodinary. Unfortunatly without having seen the play it seemed to me a mish mash or moronic singing of lines that incoherantly drift from one topic to the next never fully substantiating their meaning. If your a fan of the show maybe its phenominal but if your like me and havent seen the show dont spend your money on this"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Honest...Quite Boring","review":"I found Rent, for all of its misappropriated horn-tooting, to be quite dull. It labels itself a \\"rock musical\\" and its fans tout \\"Rent\\" to be the greatest musical ever. Well, I've heard better. I cared so little for the characters I actually found myself rolling my eyes just listening to the recording. With only a few standout songs (La Vie Boheme, I'll Cover You, Seasons of Love), the show is unexciting and far to egotistical for its own good. Don't be fooled by friends who will undoubtedly tell you how it changed their lives. Each and every character is stereotyped beyond belief and not in a suitable manner either. And with a yawning plot, Rent is not the type of musical we need to hear. Get a quality cast recording instead (hint: Bat Boy, a true rock musical)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Broadway","review":"I was hesitant about purchasing \\"Rent (1996 Original Broadway Cast)\\" due to the language on the 'listen first' tracks.

I would definitly recommend this to anybody who enjoys musical productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relive the show","review":"This is a must if you liked the Broadway show. Fans who have seen only the movie are missing out on some great songs and arrangements. The instrumentation from the movie is more polished, as are some of the voices. Jesse Martin's voice has really improved with age. However the movie is missing the great transitions and blending between pieces of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Verismo 100 Years Later on Broadway","review":"As Puccini's La Boheme was to Italian opera, rent is American \\"verismo\\" at its Broadway musical best. A supercharged, high-energy cast, with powerful voices to match, make Rent, and this orginal cast recording, an electrifying musical theater experience.It is steeped in contemporary relevance from the ground up and not from the pulpit. Effectively employing the pop musical vernacular of our times, Rent wins over its diverse audiences with wit, charm and poignance. And, like its operatic inspiration, Rent is a Broaway musical to see and hear (on this cast recording) again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best thing that ever happened to me!","review":"I love RENT!

Songs like \\"One Song Glory\\" and \\"Without You\\" tend to plod on forever like Larson is trying to write a musical Chekhov monologue, except he fails very very badly. Somewhere, Giacommo Puccini is rolling in his grave. I hate this show with a burning passion. I hated it. I hated every stupid moment of it. I hated the thought that people would be entertained by this awful piece of poorly-written musical \\"theatre.\\" I hated every single audience-insulting moment of it.

Jonathan Larson is the spiritual power behind the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunner in every respect","review":"...there are musicals that are simply so good, so funny and smart and electrifying and life-affirming..\\"Rent\\" is such an event. Yes, you can pick at the sporadic sentimentality that creeps in now and then in the second half. But why? Why when the overall result proves to be downright magical in its artistic daring and deep humanism? Every song sparkles with loose, jangly wit and buckets of heart. The story glows with love for its characters, while unafraid to lay bare their flaws as well. The whole glorious production, powered by a remarkable cast, captures the heart and engages the mind. While nothing replaces seeing \\"Rent\\", the cast recording is the next best thing. Truly, the highest compliment you can give \\"Rent\\" is that it practices what it preaches. The ultimate message is to live and love to the fullest, for there is truly \\"no day but today.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Will you light my candle?","review":"One of my friends kept insisting that i listen to the music from RENT, her favorite musical, and although I already had enough soundtracks in my collection I went out and got the CD just to get her to shut up, but then I fell in love with the music. Great lyrics, wonderful tunes, and the timelessness of the problems the charecters of rent face makes it a great musical that will indure the test of time. My favorite songs are You are what you on, Were OK, and RENT, oh and of course Seasons of Love. Any musical lover who is looking for a great soundtrack thats not full of slow songs should pick up rent and be prepared to be amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This CD is wonderful!

A fantastic recital disc, which is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Reveiw of \\"The Old Demon\\"","review":"Well, this book, though wonderfully written, is very boring for most young people of today. Some in the older generation may enjoy how the old Mrs. Wang is able to do so much in her old age, but there's no action or adventure that the youth of today long to read about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Demon","review":"It was neat, because of the way the grandma was, she didn't believe in things unless she saw it.

Warning: if you see the cover - you will have to have this book. I was really surprised by the sheer number of \\"recipes\\". The recipes are separate from the project, thus allowing one to concentrate on making the faux surface and not becoming bogged down with making pattern pieces. Every recipe has a great project one can easily change into something to fit personal style. In reading over the first part of the book, it's obvious Irene is very experienced and talented in working in polymer clay. There is so much information she has shared so freely. I got the idea she truly wants the readers to enjoy the PC experience instead of \\"finding things out the hard way\\". The \\"recipe artisans\\" are very talented and amazingly clever. If you don't have time to get involved in a project, reading through this book will give you so much inspiration you will somehow make time for yourself and your clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Resource Book for Clay Artists!","review":"This book was much more than I expected ~ it's a valuable reference and resource book for both experienced clay artists and those new to this media.

Truthfully, I think this is one of the best combinations of romance, fantasy and mystery that I've read. Of course, having cats play even a small role never hurts. Shirley Murphy is able to describe the places in her novel so well you can easily picture them in your mind. I couldn't put this book down!

This board book of the immensely popular Latina explorer is filled with surprises for young readers. Lift 19 flaps to find a trick or a treat. Match the faces in a pumpkin patch. Guess who are the mystery guests waiting at the Haunted House, including the ghost with the orange tail. One of the better Dora stories. My daughters, ages 4 years 8 months and 2 years 10 months, have never met a Dora book they didn't like. This one is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Halloween HIT","review":"Regardless of whether your child \\"knows\\" all about Dora or not, this is a fun Halloween book. Its a lift the flap adventure, and there's all kinds of neat things to find under the flaps. The book design is rather clever, with my kids' favorite part being the end where some of the Dora characters are dressed in various costumes and you have to lift the flap to see who is wearing them. Very cute! It's also a sturdy board book so no worries about having bent or torn pages.

It is the perfect fit for the camera with the 18-55mm lens attached to it. Room for another lens and for the battery charger. A lot of places online suggest the 1500 for the Nikon D3100, but there is a lot of wasted space in those if you don't have a flash accessory & zoom lens (plus they cost a bit more)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pelican 1200","review":"Took this case for my Nikon on an overnight river kayak trip - it got completely submerged in water in my boat after going through rapids - when I got to a safe place, I checked it and my camera was perfectly dry - a bit bulky for a kayak trip as it is a hard case and difficult to open up while kayaking down a river.

It has a hole on either side of the handle for a lock if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the GoPro HD Hero 2 camera!","review":"Bought the Pelican 1200 for the new GoPro HD Hero2 camera system. I was concerned that it may be too small, but I was able to fit everything I needed in it with foam space to spare: GoPro camera, suction cup mount, head strap mount, roll bar mount, various adhesive mounts, spare battery, larger door for dual battery setup, USB cable and an extra SD card. This case gets strapped to the rack of an ATV and endures water, mud, dust and the occasional rock or tree branch. Water and dirt can not penetrate the heavy duty seal, and everything about this case is high quality.

If you want to leave your lense attached to any camera I would reccomend purchasing a slightly larger model as this case is a VERY tight fit. Other than that it is typical Pelican quality, outstanding. The latches are a little bit stiff when trying to lock and unlock them but I am sure that with a little more use they will loosen up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This is exactly what I needed!

In a world dominated by plastic sounding music(Plastic People! Oh, baby now you're such a draaaaaag! Sorry about that, I couldn't resist), it's so refreshing to listen to a group that doesn't sound like it's playing music simply because it's their job. Now while this was an attempt for Muddy to make a comeback, these guys sound like they love what they're doing so much that they couldn't care less if they sold one copy of the album, or even gave a hoot if they were being recorded at all! Muddy had a fantastic musical career long before this album, but in teaming up with Johnny Winter and his crew, he showed the world that Waters hadn't lost his edge but aged like a fine wine.

At that braindead age, I jumped the needle to get to \\"Old Time Rock&Roll;\\". Man, was I dumb.A few years later, I found that album and listened to the song I was skipping. I was blown away. I had to have more and bought HARD AGAIN. Best money ever spent, period. From the opening of \\"Mannish Boy\\" to the National Steel on \\"I Can't Be Satisfied\\" to the ultra funky \\"Cross-eyed Cat\\", this is the shizzle. Muddy's voice is ultra powerful, Johhny Winter and Bob Margolis interplay their guitars seamlessly and Pinetop Prking just about steals the show. Add Jerry Portnoy's harmonica and you get the most fantastic blues album ever.If you like music, you must buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Buffy book yet!","review":"I've read a ton of Buffy books and this one was the best.

But it's not just that one student - everyone in town seems to be acting cranky, and some people have even become extremely violent. Research leads Buffy to an ancient vampire, Helen, born in the days of the Roman Empire, who, true to the violent spirit of her time, has brutally murdered over a hundred slayers over nearly two thousand years. If Buffy doesn't find a way to stop Helen, she and her friends will be the next victims. This was an excellant addition to the series. There was a lot of suspense, and even a few funny lines, in spite of the serious nature of the storyline. I highly reccomend it to fans of the series; however it is very violent, so I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone younger than thirteen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"'The Evil That Men Do\\" is a very good read.

None of the campy \\"Donnie and Marie\\" type soft rock beats heard on most of the other tracks; none of that fake strings sound of that lame '70s ARP String Ensemble synthesizer (that I guess Ranwood dug outta the attic for several tracks, sheesh). Trombone work, however, is outstanding and reminiscent of their classic \\"...and Five Trombones\\" date.Alas, the sun was setting on a great run, kinda embarrassingly on tracks like \\"Jingle Bells\\"--their signature magic just isn't there.

Also, some of my wider blades tilt up a bit, but this can be improved by spacing two pieces wider apart. Would definitely recommend.

Best of all, no clunky knife block cluttering up valuable counter space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great.","review":"Sounds and looks like a great idea, but when I used them they seemed very flimsy and slide around my drawers a lot.

The ending totally spoiled the movie. And if you dont want a spoiler, stop reading now.The end of the movie made it look like God really was telling this family to kill people. I am a Christian, and this movie is totally sac religious. God would never tell someone to go out and committ mass murders. If they had ended the movie in a mannor that portrayed the killers as crazy, it would have been great. If your a Christian, this movie SHOULD greatly offend you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am very dissapointed","review":"Okay, I know many of you think that this movie is great, and I respect that, but this movie was the dumbest movie I have ever seen.

One child is skeptical & horrified by his father's actions, as the \\"Demons\\" look like humans.

I had picked it up at the bargain bin at WalMart, and the film had looked promising, so i bought it, took it home, and in my busy life promptly forgot about it...until last night.

Not for the fainthearted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused message...nothing special","review":"The film in the first half hour to hour pans out well and gets the viewer intrigued in the story.

Don't even rent, wait till TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mediocrity\\" would be a far better suiting title for this...","review":"...this movie shouldn't be even classified as a horror as it fails to frighten or terrorize on both visual and psychological aspects. A crime story with a supernatural twist, perhaps? The plot is slow and very predictable and I am not quite sure if it really did intend to provoke those few laughs from the audience. It shamelessly exploits the \\"God told me to do it\\" phenomena and to compare it to \\"The Shining\\" would mean an insult to a truly great film. It left me dissapointed in anticipation of something really scary and I would've felt cheated if I actually had to pay to see it. As for Mr King's endorsement I think his critical judgement has become a bit cloudy, perhaps due to that unfortunate and tragic accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"McConaughey's cute, but Paxton does not deliver","review":"First of all Bill Paxton delivers his lines like he is made out of stone. He is unbelievable at best. Secondly, what is meant to be a plot twist fizzles and leaves the audience still wondering what happened. We are supposed to believe that Fenton, who is so against his father's killings, grows up to be a serial killer. This just doesn't work. The only thing that would have saved this movie is if Matthew took his shirt off."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"Okay I agree that this was masterfully acted and written but the content was the most disturbing I've seen in a while. If you're looking for this okay, but the review I read made this seem like a Sixth Sense or Others type of movie and that it is not. I couldn't sleep. Call me a wimp but this movie's vision of God's avengers just doesn't jive with me and my understanding of God. The scariest thing is I could see somebody twisted out there really believing this. If you think you want to see this please do society a favor and pay attention to the R rating. Do not let your impressionable teens watch this. God forbid they get the idea God really wants these type of avengers. I work in the Mental Health field with teens and believe me they could totally turn something like this movie into a \\"holy crusade\\" for themselves. Anyway, think over your beliefs maybe even pray before watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Voice Can't Be Wrong","review":"Expecting to see a \\"triller\\", this movie was anything but. The kids should have stayed the main focus. What was the message? It's alright to kill if you hear \\"the voice of God\\"? The ending was too obvious - give the audience a little credit. It reeked of the Andrea Yeats murders with reverse parts for the kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Paxton is no actor (or Director)","review":"Bill Paxton appears to be constipated as he attempts to act. He is not fluid nor is he believable. He's got to be the worst working actor in the business (except for perhaps Adam Sandler). You just want to shake him or something everytime he speaks.

The O'Leary youngster was exceptional, but...The message of this movie is that there are demons on this world, and God can give any one of us a mission to destroy them. This is a message that it frightens me to hear at this time, with fundamentalist religious fanatics all over the earth running around killing people. The guys who killed 3000 people in New York were as religiously committed as the hero of this movie. And we have people in this country running around attempting to murder people, abortion doctors for instance, who believe they have a mission from God.I don't believe in censorship, nor have I ever thought that the material our entertainment industry gives us is damaging to normal minds. But a disturbed person can find a message in almost anything, and this message is NOT subtle.It might have been okay if the demon-killer had been damned, but I am very sorry that this film ever hit the screens."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unethical film ever made.","review":"This is the worst film ever made.When you read this review, you're going to think I'm exaggerating. Then you'll see the film and realize I'm being even-handed:This movie promotes the idea that atheists are demons, and that people who murder them with a lead pipe and an axe are doing the work of God, so much so that God will literally help them personally in their murderous effort.Now let me make this clear: I do mean \\"demons\\", that is literally the term used in the film. And I do mean a lead pipe and an axe. And I do mean that you literally see supernatural events occur that are presented in the film as the work of God, asisting those who murder atheists.

It JUSTIFIES the grisly slaughter.It is like a documetary about Hitler that first shows in horrid detail the killing of 6 million Jews and 7 million others, and then says, \\"But it's all right, because THEY DESERVED IT.\\"To be fair, the acting (particularly of the older son as a boy), the directing, the dialogue are super.All the more reason to give a shudder and avoid this apology for self-righteous killing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Frailty\\" An Appropriate Title","review":"Where to begin? This movie has so many problems, beginning with a widowed father (played by director Bill Paxton) who suddenly becomes deranged before the viewer has a chance to even learn about the character. Follow this with an angel popping out of a muffler, an axe and gloves glowing from the beam of a heavenly light from above, a contrived \\"gotcha\\" ending, and an inexcusable character twist for the FBI agent (Powers Booth), and FRAILTY dissolves into psycho-babbling nonsense.One of the reviewers has tagged this movie \\"a thinking man's horror film.\\" I would respectfully disagree.

He tells his kids that he is just trying to protect them, but what he is really doing, is slaughtering innocent people for the fun of it.

Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly frustrating","review":"\\"Frailty\\" had great premise, great story, great acting... then about 20 minutes before the end, it totally shot itself in the foot.Someone said once that good directors start with the supernatural and slowly and subtly build to reveal the reality underneath (think Hitchcock's \\"Vertigo\\"). Bad directors go the other way around. Well, this is a perfect example of bad directing. The ending was disappointing, nonsensical and, I felt, a major cop-out.It's still worth seeing if you're a fan of dark psychological thrillers that make you ask questions. But it's not for everyone. You might love it, but then again you might hate it. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked me in and sucker punched me","review":"So...this movie, frailty. i liked the idea. Hell I even liked the movie or at least I liked it until the end. It's one of those movies that is just so great and then they throw a twist in and your left sitting there thinking What The F**k!!!I have to admit, I didn't see the twist coming. It surprised me. But it sucked because it ruins the whole movie. It turns it into this religious piece of crap that doesn't really make you think it just basically says that it's okay to kill a bunch of people as long as you say god told you to do it.I think I'm rambling... that is because I did like the idea behind this movie and the acting was great, there were even some really creepy scenes and a lot of tension, but the plot twist at the end ruins it all.... The cheesy flashbacks to the murders... the justification... I just didn't like it.I wouldn't recommend you buy this movie. I never will because the religious overtones turn my stomach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I'm a big fan of thriller/horror type movies and I figured that this one would be great.

I don't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"high hopes","review":"A motherless family whose widowed father goes insane and gets his children to help him kill in the name of God. Needless to say, I had high hopes for this movie. The true horror in the film is the repeating of the word evil that makes me think of G. W. Bush. I have been told that this is what his childhood was like minus a few blows the head and the occasional line of coke. They must have cut that part out. The producer couldn't get the rights to the Bush story so they changed the names and released this. The similarities are undeniable. If you like disaster stories like Armageddon or the current administration you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Paxton's Egomania","review":"Forcing two competent adult actors to overact so intensely that they telegraph the \\"twist\\" ending with every nuance, while keeping himself at a safe distance stiffly chewing the scenery like a godzilla beaver hovered over two naturalistic child actors. As for his direction, I understand Paxton may have lacked the money for crane, dolly, or handheld shots, but his refusal to pan, zoom, jump cut, or come up with a single interesting angle or establishing shot would be unacceptable even in 1950. Just one more bland clumsy atheist's demonization of all fathers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Horror Classic","review":"For a horror film in this day and age, they are few and far between to find great ones.Although, I'm a Horror Film Fanatic. I see every horror film that is released in the states.Frailty is a homage to great classic horror films. The intensity of the film is overwelming. It's low-budget but it works because it's the simplicity that makes it scary. It's not glamourous or pretty. But, it's a horror film. In my mind pretty horror films never work. It's gritty, it's mean, but it is something that could take place in any neighborhood in America.It's simple but real.All of the scares and emotions are real.A great film and a Horror Classic. I saw it in an Independent Film Theater and bought as soon as it hit shelves on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy And Disturbing","review":"FRAILTY is the outcome one would get if filmmakers adapted Stephen King with success(MISERY notwithstanding). Bill Paxton's directorial debut weaves an intricate plot in which a widower believes that God is instructing him to \\"destroy\\" demons here on earth, which happen to be taking on human form. He enlists the aid of his two very young sons to carry off his mission. The story is told through flashback by Matthew McConaughey(who plays one of sons) to FBI agent Powers Boothe, who is the investigator in charge of the \\"God's Hand\\" killings case. Paxton directs the film with classy understatement--there's very little blood, and the ax murders committed by the father are alluded to and not shown for gratuity's sake. And the though some may figure out the \\"God's Hand\\" killer in the end, there are still a couple of surprises that may shock some. All in all, a wonderfully acted, well-made thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best this year!!!","review":"A real noodle twister!I love when the story starts and ends now days as well as goes back in time, and then culminates as it is being told by one of the main characters. Like Interview with the Vampire. Really weird movie I would say, just the kind I like, makes you think at the end too. Also exploits the values of good and evil in all of us. Extremely good performance by Matthew McConaughey and an even better one by my old favorite Bill Paxton for whom this was his first directorial effort. I remember him well from Aliens 1 and The Abyss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sick and twisted movie","review":"Frailty was to me a very intresting movie with some great actors in it but overall a sick and twisted plotline to bring the people into to see the movie. I personally loved the mixture of horror, and suspense triller elements thrown into it. But like some people your either going to love the movie or dislike it. I have now watched it twice in my lifetime, it is a very powerful movie and will keep you guessing but a few people didn't like the ending because in the end it will make you think was he really doing God's work by being the God's hand killer or where you what the heck is this ending for. I personally enjoy the whole moving inculding the ending to it because I like to think at end of some movies to see if I was right about who the killer is and or so forth. But if you need a good horror suspense triller movie then pick this movie up and be prepare for a very sick movie but with a great but twisted plotline."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Horror Films I've Ever Seen","review":"Frailty may have a stupid name but it is a great horror film and it isn't excessively gory.The movie is about an adult FentonMeiks(Matthew McConaughey) telling an FBI agent the story of how his father (played terrificly by Bill Paxton who also directs)believes God told him to kill demons,who end up being real people.Fenton doesn't believe a word his dad says,however Fentons younger brother Adam believes all of it.The film is also a film you want to watch,you can't stop staring at the screen and be thinking whats gonna happen next.The scene with Bill Paxton and the angel is awesome,the effects are wild.The ending couldnn't have been any better although it is semi predictable,now the film which isn't scary at all is still a terrific movie,even better than most gory horror films such as \\"Wrong Turn\\".The acting is great I think it's amazing that Matthew McConaughey or Bill Paxton didn't win any awards for the film,but i'd buy this movie any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, yet you can't turn away","review":"This movie is more of a physcological thriller, the story is told in narrative by Matthew McConaughey, flash backs to the time he was young and lived with his father and younger brother. I felt so disturbed by the father turning into for better lack of word, a fanatic demon killer. The transition is overnight, so you are left asking yourself is he crazy, he must be. Then he includes the boys in his crazy mission. At this point you really start to feel sorry for the boys, but then the movie takes a twist, that I didn't see coming. Everyone did superb acting in this movie, and I was quite surprised to have liked it so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! -[...] - @tss5078","review":"This is a great cast in a terrible movie. McConaughey goes to the FBI with an eyewitness account of a notorious murder he witnessed when he was a kid. From there the whole movie is done in flashbacks, similar to The Usual Suspects. Sounds pretty good right? Nope! In The Usual Suspects, things happen, you were drawn into the story. Frailty doesn't have any of that. It's like watching one of these lame reality shows, that takes place inside some families home. Until the end nothing happens! ...finally you get to the end and you see something! My reaction to it was, 'that was it, that's what you were building up to this whole time!?' The trailer, the description, and the cast might suck you in, but seeing this movie is a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda Good, bu kinda stupid, 3.5 Stars","review":"Frailty, I will admit is better than most of the modern horror films out there, but at the same time it's kind of poorly acted and lacks a little common sense. The ending is predictable, and the music is bad. Frailty is about a guy who murders people with an axe because he thinks they are demons. It's not gory (sorry gore fans), and Bill's preformance is somewhat laughable. No offense though, I've seen WAY worse!(ala Scream and Jack-O) Anyway if you are thinking about seeing it, than go right ahead, but don't expect to much, because this movie doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISTURBING","review":"...I for one, love thrillers and somewhat horror movies, but this one crossed the line (I guess i'm not your average Stephan King lover)..This movie really puts you in a mental shock, who can think or come up with such a story?I have to admit though, that the acting was top class.. Paxton does a great job being the loving father and a loyal Christian, the kids too are superb..But I will never watch this movie again, and nor would I recommend it full heartedly to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"An above average horror/drama","review":"I really liked this movie. It poses an alternate view about our beliefs about life, and about religion. It shows how the majority isn't always right, and just because \`something' isn't the norm, or is unacceptable, doesn't mean that \`something' is wrong. Anyway, a good movie that will make you think about your own religion and the afterlife. My only minor complaint is I do not like it when a horror movies don't show the blood scenes. We all know what I'm talking about. You see an axe life up in the air, maybe a shadow on the wall, and a splatter of blood. Other than the cut violence editing scenes, it was a good movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the Frail (of mind)","review":"An excellent film, with respect to acting, script, production values, and theme. The theme--a timely one--is the narrow divide between religious enthusiasm and murderous psychopathology devolving from presumptive or perceived evil of \\"the other.\\" A horror-suspense drama, to be sure: even as rabid sectarian violence so much in the news is horrifying. However, unlike this film, which keeps the auditor guessing as to finality, until the very end, in the real-life horror we know from the beginning the likely ending. An unusually thoughtful film for an audience more aware than the usual audience for the usual crass lumpen entertainment usually presented by movielandia."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Years Best!","review":"By my surprise, Frailty turns out to be one of the best films of the year. About a father and his 2 sons who are chosen by God to kill the demons in the world. One catch, the demons come in the form of humans. With incredible performances from Bill Paxton, Matthew Mcchonaughey, and especially Matthew O'Leary as the young Fenton, this film is horrifying. Director Bill paxton creates an eerie atmosphere that makes the film all the more creepy. I don't want to give much away about the movie and there are a few surprises that will make you jump so all I can say is I loved this movie. Everything about it. I love horror movies and rarely do I get frightened by them. This one did it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Film Excellent Story","review":"I didn't know what to expect before seeing this movie so I was kinda surprised about the subject matter. However I loved it. Bill Paxton really proved he is a great actor and film maker. The young actors who play his children were flawless in their roles. I think if my father claimed to be on a mission from god to destroy demons I would have reacted like the older kid did. The whole religion thing really seems to freak people out so I guess that's why this movie never faired well in theaters. People are too dang afraid of everything these days. If they are so faithful then why would a little ol' indy movie shake their faith so much.

Whoever selected the cast went out of their way to find an \\"American\\" that either was naturally pathetic or was inclided to betray American's as pathetic. The first hint this was a Chinese Comm. propaganda film was the reluctance to show the revolutionary army's battle flag fully extended. The very last line in the film claimed the whole revolution was the effort of the Communists who,truth be told, did not exist for many years after the fact and had no role in 1911. This may be the reason it seemed so much was cut out. Perhaps the ChiComms deleted all materiel' that was contra to thier propaganda. The quality of the sets and the action scences are first-rate, however. The effort,on a whole,resulted in a waste of time and money when anything Jackie Chan and/or Joan Chin should be at least worth otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"In my opinion, this is one of Jackie Chan's weakest movies. The pace of the movie left no room for actor play and character development. Unless someone understands the history of what was happening in China in 1911 (which I do not), it is hard to make sense of what is going on in the movie. There is an attempt to put the explanation and commentary on the screen, but the font is so small, it is impossible to read in regular definition resolution. After watching the movie I have no more knowledge or understanding of what happened in China in 1911. I also could not bring myself to connect with any of the characters.The biggest thing that just escapes me with this movie, though, is this. Does Jackie Chan really believe that the revolution was a good thing for China and that Communism has anything good to offer? Was the movie a piece of propaganda forced onto him by the Chinese government (which would explain why the movie is so bad)? I just do not get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chinese communist propaganda","review":"Interesting historical subject matter, good production values, but ... blatant Chinese communist propaganda.According to the film, the Qing dynasty was corrupt, and therefore had to be taken down. Only then could freedom, peace, and prosperity break out in China. And the work did not end with the 1911 revolution; it was continued by the communist revolution some decades later. Apparently the communists carried forward the spirit of the 1911 revolution and brought about the \\"rejuvenation of the state\\". The revolutionaries were virtuous, those who died were martyrs, their work was glorious, etc. etc. etc.Read some history books and check out communist China's human rights record, and you'll get an idea of the communist version of freedom, peace, and prosperity.

I like historical movies and Jackie Chan but it was very difficult to keep up with this film, much less have an understanding of what was happening. It took me a few minutes to realize that the Chinese characters and English subtitles on the sides of the screen were to identify the participants, not the actors, mostly because I was trying to keep up with the dialogue subtitles. Then the screen started displaying more and more information - descriptions of the timeline and actions. Now, I am an avid reader and have a decent reading speed but I just could not keep up with three separate groups of text running simultaneously with the action. The acting seemed decent, the production values great but I felt like I should have read a book first. My memories of this time period in China from World History classes are 40+ years old. Finally turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"1911","review":"Historical epics have been a part of Chinese cinema for a long time, and now that Jackie Chan has grown just a tad too old to pull the insane stunts of his youth, it makes sense that his latest film, his first directorial effort since 1998's Who Am I?, is 1911, a historical drama about the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew China's last imperial dynasty. Released on the 100th anniversary of the revolution and marking Chan's 100th film, 1911 was unfortunately a failure here in the States, where it took home just over $135,000 at the box office is one of the worst films of Chan's career. The problem, is that the film relies too heavily on title cards to explain already convoluted plot points, rendering the proceedings more akin to a history lesson than a piece of entertainment. If you aren't already familiar with the story taking place, you may find 1911 tedious, overlong, and dry, three words you'd never have thought to associate with a Jackie Chan movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Always read the fine print!","review":"well I am really disappointedI was trying to help my 86 year old Mom pick out gifts for her great grandchildren from their wish lists.I failed to read the fine print (an apparently my daughter did too) about \\"add-ons\\" and the plastic packaging.It's not a pretty picture ...see photos.But it doesn't stop there...the price is reasonable but I was also charged nearly the same amount for shipping a package that was so small I could have stuffed into an envelope and mailed with a 44 cent stamp.

It's a straight up funk piece of music and shows that Braun wants to give this outing a funkier feel than his past couple of albums which leaned more in the direction of pop smooth jazz. The sound is continued throughout the album, most notably on Grover's Groove and on one of the two vocal tracks It's Your World.The album is also a mellower affair than in the past, with more ballads like Kisses in the Rain and Middle of the Night standing out as smooth tracks that Braun's fans have come to know & love. I still say that Full Stride is his best, but if you've been a fan of Rick Braun, you will enjoy this album. And if you haven't but are looking for something with a little more spice than the average smooth jazz sound, you'll also enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this","review":"It's sexy, it's smooth, it's funky - it's everything we love Rick Braun for.

There is not a track on this disc I don't love, not one you can keep your hips still to, not one you won't want to hear over and over. Does that mean Rick's gone a little pop here?

The coating on these things looks to be simple, hard black enamel paint - no Teflon coating or any other \\"non-stick\\" surface. Don't believe the hype. You will need to butter or oil them every time you use them.The little handle that keeps them all together is a bit flimsy and the rings themselves flop around constantly. That's fine when they are dry to keep them together but when they are hot and your eggs are stuck to them - and they will stick without pre-treatment - the whole contraption becomes quite unwieldy and a bit hazardous to handle and deal with.Other than that, the price is right.

So, the egg ring gets my vote! I have used the ring when I made pancakes and if you don't mind small pancakes, then the ring should work for you.

Jason Vieaux is one of the best recitalists in the world, more than that, he is one of the best teachers and concert-guitarists in the world. But he fails to capture the true -free-spirited-essence of metheny's songs and does not convey the magic or emotion. What we are left with is not the magical music of metheny, but music that is sterile, trite, and contrived for the enjoyment of guitarists who are impressed more with the artistry of technique than the higher art of expression. Essentially, this is metheny without the color and vibrance (and rhythm!!)Please respect my dissention and honesty, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar performance!","review":"Excellent work for Jason Vieaux. There is huge market for cross-over music, and now Jasaon Vieaux has made it acceptable for even the most rigid of classical musicians to enjoy jazz.

This translation is even more formal and archaic than the original.

A version of \\"Begin The Beguine\\" transposed into an inappropriate key by Sheryl Crow does not \\"transform\\" the song so much as \\"disfigure\\" it.Far from making these already immortal songs \\"accessible\\" for a \\"new generation,\\" this soundtrack trashes some of the greatest popular songs ever composed.

Begin the Beguine was my mother's favorite song, and here it is thrown away; no melody whatsoever. I almost didn't even realize when it was being sung. I won't take these songs apart one by one; suffice it to say the movie was really good, the music is, in my opinion, dispicable.

Lemar has soul, and Kevin Kline/Jonathan Pryce are pretty good (IMHO). Cole Porter's song is also good.I didn't much like Elvis Costello's performance of \\"Let's Misbehave\\". But that's the only dull spot in an otherwise good CD.As I said, I hadn't heard of Cole Porter before (shame on me, for sure!) - so I don't have preconceived notions of how the songs should be. For example - I read LOTR before seeing the movie, and I just spent my time at the theatre shaking my head rather than just enjoying the visual spectacle.... much to my regret.So - especially if you haven't heard Cole Porter before - I'd say go for it, get the De-Lovely soundtrack.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Soundtrack","review":"Very Good!

In that form it would have been laughed off of the stage in the time frame of its original performance. Remaining true to the written melody seems to be a forgotten concept of many of today's ARTISTS.

Alanis Morissette takes bottom honors for her evisceration of \\"Let's Do It,\\" which makes nails on a chalkboard sound melodic. Sheryl Crow dissects \\"Begin the Beguine,\\" which is put in a MINOR key, thus destroying the chord progressions throughout. She's seldom sounded as gratingly nasal. Elvis Costello's \\"Let's Misbehave\\" is a travesty; Diana \\"Mrs. Costello\\" Krall's \\"Just One of Those Things\\" is a very bad thing indeed; and the other performances are uniformly dreadful, except for Vivian Green's Billie Holiday-ish \\"Love For Sale\\" and Natalie Cole's inoffensive \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye.\\" That a new generation should be exposed to Cole Porter's music with this collection of \\"hip\\" barrel-scrapings is a musical crime. Vomitous."},{"rating":"1","title":"De-Lovely? Hardly!","review":"This cd is being sold on TV. When I heard some of the performances, I was appalled. Poor Cole Porter, to be represented in this way. People, get out to the music stores and get his music as done by really proficient Porter interpreters. For example, there is a better performance on LET'S MISBEHAVE in the (excellent) comedy film, JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (musicians unknown to me). I wish that Tony Bennett would make an all-Porter album. Then, you'd be hearing something worthwhile! I'll give it 2 stars, for Diana Krall & Natalie Cole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the passion?","review":"As one other review stated, \\"Painful\\"! And indeed this album is. So that I won't bore you, song after song after song lacks \\"passion\\". Night and Day as sung by John Barrowman and Kevin Kline is about as miserable example of the poorest rendition of this classic as you will find. Every other song on this CD ranks, in my opinion, in this same category. Had these songs been released in their present form as sung by the artists on this CD per this CD, most of Cole Porter's tunes would have destined for obscurity. Save your money - go for the real thing - the Cole Porter music of the past as rendered by the artists of his era. As for me, I'm selling this De-Lovely first chance I get at my next garage sale. It is definitely not worth keeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked It!","review":"This is a fresh, different intepretation of songs we've heard many times.

Sheryl Crow's version of \\"Begin the Beguine\\" with a samba beat is different and works because it is distinctive. Elvis Costello's ragtime version of \\"Let's Misbehave\\" is wonderfully silly. Diana Krall's \\"Just One of Those Things\\" may be the pearl of the set with its insistent piano continually poking at the melody. The set ends with the master himself, Cole Porter, plunking out \\"You're the Top.\\" Porter's music is classic. It has graced so many musicals in the last century that there is no question but that he will long be remembered for his witty melodies. \\"De-Lovely\\" is a celebration of that life as it is remembered cinematically. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a lovely de-lovely soundtrack","review":"This soundtrack needed a boost from Tony Bennett, Harry Connick Jr., Norah Jones, Aaron Neville, and Dianne Reeves.

The songs are wonderful, of course, but the vocal quality of the various performers is dismal.

BUT... hearing ONLY the soundtrack it is a 2... why? Because the music is some of the most melodic and beautiful ever written and several performances are neither authentic of the time, or not sung in a way the beauty of the song can be heard. This music is NOT about the performer... it was about the song! Most of the original recordings which featured a singer did not even have the singers name on the record! That is because the song was beautiful and did NOT need a song \\"stylist\\" to make it \\"all about the singer\\"!Having said that, most of the songs in the film are not bad... and standouts include Natalie Cole and Diana Krall. The sad renditions are worst with Sheryl Crow TRYING to sing \\"Begin the Beguine\\" and Elvis Costello who butchers \\"Let's misbehave.\\"Get these tunes on CD from some great people who sang them in the past... like Sinatra, Torme, Clooney, Bennett and Vaughn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack to a mediocre movie","review":"I caught the movie on a transatlantic flight, and if it weren't for the wonderful music would have fallen asleep. The first couple of numbers in the movie, De-Lovely sung by Robbie Williams (who really seems to have an affinity for old standards, as he's proven before with his rendering of Beyond the Sea), and What Is This Thing Called Love by Lemar, a British soul singer with a wonderful husky voice, were enough to convince me to buy this CD. Other highlights include Alanis Morrisette giving a nice saucy twist to Let's Do It and the always reliable Natalie Cole. There are are few ho-hum entries here which dropped the rating to 4 stars, such as Ashley Judd attempting to sing. Diana Krall also did not do much for me here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job","review":"Who knew Alanis Morisette could do traditional songs? Or Kevin Kline? I like this re-recording and the talent they've pulled together. While I know some people have complaints about messing with the Master, Porter's songs are timeless and part of the joy of them is that they're new everytime someone else sings them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the lyrics?","review":"This delightful soundtrack is the perfect introduction for newcomers to Porter's catalogue (and I don't care what anybody else thinks, Elvis Costello does a terrific job of singing \\"Let's Misbehave\\"!). It would have been helpful, however, to those of us who want to sing along with some of the most beautiful and clever songs ever written, to have a sheet of lyrics to go along with the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cole Porter like you never heard before.","review":"Interesting is the best word for this album. Kevin Kline's singing is entertaining - he's a better singer than Cole Porter. At first I did not like the album, but it grew on me. Most of the songs are entertaining when taken in context with the movie and the fact these songs were written for broadway and not the recording studio. I prefer my Porter by Sinatra, Bennett, Nat King Cole, etc., but most of these artists give adequate, if not familiar treatment to his music. The worst, by far, is Sheryl Crowe's version of Begin the Beguine. She thoroughly ruins one of the greatest songs ever written. All in all, even with his tinny voice, Cole Porter's own version of You're the Top is the best song on the album. It's definitely a soundtrack - not a definitive collection of Cole Porter music."},{"rating":"2","title":"De-Lovely Soundtrack","review":"No matter what you thought of the movie, the music is well worth listening to! The new, fresh approach to Cole Porter's hits is well-done, in my opinion. If you are a fan of Porter's work, I think you will especially like the updated treatments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porter Deserves Better Singers for the most part","review":"I was excited about this soundtrack. After giving it a listen though, the champagne fizzled and fell flat. Most importantly in a Porter song is the delivery of his wonderful lyrics and notes. Unfortunately, the pacing and orchestrations are off or not up to the high standards that MGM, Paramount and other studios were able to excel so wonderfully at in the 1950's. There are a few exceptions to the rule and three singers capture the spirit of Cole. Those being first Vivian Green, Natalie Cole and Elvis Costello. If you really want to enjoy Porter delivered in the high fashion he deserves buy the soundtrack to these films, Kiss Me Kate(1953), Anything Goes (1956) High Society (1956) Can Can (1960) or even Born To Dance (1936). Cole Porter does save the day on the last track of the De-Lovely soundtrack by singing and playing with all his magical flair with the song \\"You're The Top.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Great pop/jazz standards here by modern singers. Can't go wrong here if you like this genre of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame On Them All!","review":"I bought this cd quite sometime ago, and it was almost painfulto listen to. All the producers did with this film is pander to the same generation that is buying Rod Stewart's Great Americansongbook series. They have to all be tone deaf! If you want to hear Porter's music in the way it was intended try these:1. What Is This Thing Called Love? - Frank SinatraFrom The Cd: In The Wee Small Hours2. In The Still Of The Night - Julie LondonFrom The Cd: Sings The Choicest Cole Porter3. De-Lovely - Ella FitzgeraldFrom The Cd: The Cole Porter Songbook4.

What a travesty!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Admit I'm No Musical Authority","review":"I see the common complaint of arrangement quality and so on and so forth, and perhaps if you are very musically inclined than there are flaws. With that being said, personally I love the soundtrack and the movie. I think it's simply one of my greatest \\"pick me up Cds\\". I also utterly enjoyed the vocals of everyone, sure they aren't always accurate to the time period or even the broadway sound, but none the less the songs get stuck in my head the same. If you like the movie it is more than likely you will enjoy the soundtrack. If you are looking for original duplicates of Porter's music, then there is either the potential of adoration or lothing. My advice is sample it at a music store and, if like me, you can't get it out of your head, endulge!

It's heavy & could be used as a weapon. The handle is a hard, not like a regular cane. It has a double pin instead of one positioning the height. The swing using it normally will build up muscles in the arm you use. Medline has made a really good cane. If your older or frail make sure you can handle the weight. It supports a person up to 500lbs. I'm 6'4\\" & 335lbs. I have no problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bargain!","review":"Yes, it is cheap and looked good, so I ordered three of them to have a couple spares. Big mistake. Those labels stuck all over the cane are impossible to remove and highly annoying but even worse is that the ring you need to turn to make the cane longer or shorter does not turn. It is stuck so hard that the cane can not be adjusted without the help of Superman and even he might have a hard time. I called the company on their 1-800 number and they were very nice but admitted that \\"sometimes\\" the ring is hard to turn. I have no one to help me adjust the height so these three canes are useless to me. I would return them to Amazon but it would cost $24 plus change. Not worth the effort and aggravation. These canes are going to end up in the trash. Also, the listing said they have a foam handle; they don't. The handles are hard plastic. I am very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This Cane ...","review":"... If you want what's in the description. I would have given it a zero but that was not an option. I'm sure the cane is good and all but when I buy something I expect to get what I ordered. There is no locking collar (and no lanyard which is not really that important to me personally).

The book was a lot closer to a low C grade. There was little to no character development, scummy heros (a dangerous move that can only be pulled off by very good writers), and most frustrating of all no research into the supposed plot line. As a woman scientist I dont expect everyone to be familiar with the field, however something as blatant as the ethical issues of human testing I did expect to be common knowledge, if only from the movies. \\"Thursday's Child\\" was a major let down, especially since I've read some of her other books and I know she can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"dreadful","review":"What a horrible book. I was hoping for an unhappy ending because I just hated these people for boring me to death. I got it on audio and I went through the last tape in 5 minutes by fast forwarding through most of it.

So I gave it 1 star, it was better (but not much) than sports."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book did not keep my intrest","review":"Sandra Brown is one of my favorite authors. Her books have a way of pulling you in from the beginning. This one was no different, however, as I read more I was very disappointed. The story started out great and fizzed about mid way through the book. I kept reading hoping that it would improve but it never did. Luckly this was not the first Sandra Brown book I ever read because I would have never read another one. I would not recommend this particular book to anyone, however, I would recommend all the others I have read. I like her suspense novels much better than her pure romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute story","review":"I have twin daughters, which is why I bought this book and wanted to read it.The story was cute during the first half, but had too much kissing and sex and petting in the second half for me.I am not fond of this type of story, but if you are a romance story fan, then this book is for you.At times, a bit far fetched but a real intersting storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex, Sex, and More Sex","review":"My review title says it all. An implausible plot, no mystery, you know from page one how it will turn out. I guess I am giving it one star because you can fall asleep during half of the book and still not miss anything. I listened to this book as an audio book. Might be a good 'beach book.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is merely foreplay","review":"I'd never read Sandra Brown before, but a friend recommended this book when she saw me reading a book by Cassandra King, telling me that if I liked King I'd also like Brown. There is no way the two are similar. To be fair, I've never read anything else by Brown, but after reading this book I certainly don't intend to. The book consisted almost entirely of descriptions of kissing, foreplay and finally the sexual act itself. The 'plot' was very meager and I didn't even finish reading the book; I merely skipped to the end, and, as expected \\"the boy got the girl.\\" There was no character development and the storyline was pretty unbelievable. I don't understand how Brown can consider herself a serious author when she writes this kind of trash. I suppose there are those out there who like to vicariously live out their sex life through books; I am not one of those people. I do like a good romance now and again, this doesn't qualify."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bathroom Material","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers, this novel by Sandra Brown was extremely boring. Like others, I found myself passing pages to get to the end. Even put it in the bathroom because it only held my interest momentarily. It reminded me a prank that high school twins would play on their boyfriends. It was not highly the style that I am accustomend to when reading Brown's writing so this novel was a complete flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"No title","review":"I did not order this book. I ordered the same title, but by a different author. It was for a middle school book club, for a boy. It would have cost most of the cost of the book to return, so I threw it away (in a charity give away bin) unread. I don't read romance novels, and neither does my 14 year old son."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book","review":"I was very disappointed in Thursdays Child. I found the plot to simple and silly. I don't mind reading a simple book , but I found that this book was to unbelieveable. The charactors behaved in away that I don't think anyone would or at least I hope they would'nt. The book seems to have been written with no thought. I found that all the books that Sandra Brown has done early in her career and has had reprinted have been written that way. If you want to read a good Sandra Brown book pick up any of her new books, those are written with thought and substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Sandra Brown's Best!","review":"I,personally, am a huge fan of Sandra Brown, and this novel is just another example why. It's the classic story of two twins harmlessly changing places and the results of doing just that. The story is fast paced, easy to follow, full of romance and the narrator, Eliza Foss, is absolutely wonderful! This is the perfect audio book for a long car ride or just to listen to while relaxing in the tub.

This book won't do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Sandra Brown has written many novels but her male characters are all arrogant and full of themselves and her female characters are all submissive and passive. This book will demonstrate this very quickly when Spencer is trying to seduce his best friend's fiancé.This bothers me in Sandra Brown's novels. I haven't finished too many of them for this reason. The only book of hers I enjoyed was \\"Adam's Fall\\" and that's it. If you want to waste your time at reading nonsense go ahead and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God... I never knew a book could be so horrible!","review":"This is my first book from Sandra Brown and well... it makes me not want to read any of her other work. Yeah, I heard she's a real good author and all, but this book just put me off. Ok, so the beginning started out pretty interesting, despite the characters being extremely and almost disbelievably shallow. But when Spencer began persuading \\"Ann\\" to leave her fiance, geez, i was about ready to throw this book across the room. But that wasn't the lease of it, suddenly, Allision is in love with him? Excuse me? Sorry? I think I completely missed something here. She met him what? 3 days ago? But I continued reading it, God knows why.. and I don't believe I ever had such a strong urge to throw a book across the room. So all and all, I thought this book was dreadful and even horribly written. No plot line, no depth, and the dialogue? Don't even get me started..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary Lackluster","review":"Can she write? Apparently so, but this latest from Ms. Brown seems written by rote. My main objection to it, however, is that the characters are so one-dimensional and unreal. The plot, too, is weak, which could be overlooked if not for the characters. My worst fear is that the world she describes might actually exist. Still, for a light and mindless distraction, this book is perfect and quickly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute drivel.","review":"I am unfortunately listening to this book so I cannot easily fast forward past the many descriptions of Allison's nipples.

I'm glad I waited until the paperback - the wallet pain was lessened.

Lingappa and Farey should be commended for the work that they have done. The clinical focus makes the text much more interesting to read. The cases used to introduce each chapter provide good examples of how physiology can be used in a clinical setting and often adhere to the tone of the modern medical environment. The charts and diagrams used to illustrate the concepts do a good job of facilitating and summarizing the knowledge presented in each chapter. As the old adage goes, a picture is worth a thousand words.

Just a joy to read. In fact, I totally lost an entire day as I just couldn't put it down. I can't wait to read more from Ms. Lotempio!

What REALLY angers me is that it always crashes when the really cool new transit systems come along (MagLev), thus proving that I wasted two hours getting to that point. Saving before an expected crash and coming back has no effect. I've tried all of the patches and fixes that have come along, all of my drivers are up to date, and yet it still crashes.I really wish this game were more stable, as I have never actually been able to complete it.

The dialogue is too unreal and lengthy; no one really talks like the people in the book. There is also a lot of repetition in the book at the end of every chapter, and in how the author keeps pointing out that Isaiah and Torri are \\"carbon copies\\" of Asia and Nicholas. Certain details in the novel are too detailed and other parts are not detailed enough. Basically, you should read this book to uplift yourself, not to challenge yourself in reading good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the end of this book May Never Come","review":"Once reading the other reviews I saw that it wasn't just me. I just couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I would be reading and then just forced to put it down out of boredom. I would try to read it again and the same thing so I just quit.First off the beginning was too fast. Bam, he confronts his father. Bam, they are willing to work past their differences and get to know one another over dinner. Bam, Isaiah is in a car accident. That was the entire story line by the 2nd or third chapter. The rest of the book is stagnant and revolves around scenes from the hospital room.And to be a Christian novel I wasn't even down with all the out of wedlock pregnancies from Asia to Torri.And that one scene where Torri is like \\"Oh, Mommy Asia hold me!\\" and Asia responds \\"Come to Mommy Asia.\\" Give me a break! Can we say corny?? Leave that for the Young and the Restless and General Hospital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzz Zzzzzz Zzzzzz","review":"This was the most painful book I've ever read. Painful in the sense that the story dragged on chapter after chapter, the author kept repeating the same things over and over and the characters were a bit too unrealistic. Nothing about this book held my interest or made me want to keep turning pages. I wanted to give up about half way through but I made a promise to a friend to read it. So I prodded on to see how it finally ended and it took me 3 weeks to finish it. Normally I finish a good book in 3 days. If you like drawn out, mushy stories, then this book is for you. If you're like me and like a book that has a good pace and an interesting storyline with believable characters, this book isn't it. Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I read this book sometime ago and just added it to my collection. It was a really good book and so easy to read.

Yes the main characters profess a belief in God. However that does not seem to stop them from declaring their love for each other even tho of them is married to someone else, crossing the line when being tactile and rejoicing over an out of wedlock birth, and being married for all the wrong reasons.This has a soap atmosphere to it, the dialogue is extremely corny - if you want to read a book that deals with a real life topic and has real dialogue plus Christian style romance read Boaz Brown by Michelle StimpsonI borrowed this from the library its taking me months to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs!

She was disappointed at first because she already had the first edition, but then got really excited when she saw the new material included in the second edition. BTW, the pics in this book are GRAPHIC so do not purchase for a young (child) horse enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fueling the Myth","review":"Here's another example of religion being based on fear and how misconceptions can create hatred. True Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with Satan. Before you you judge too heavily, remember that Christianity was once hidden and secret (the meaning of the word occult) and persecuted against. A better book would be \\"The Truth About Witchcraft Today\\" by Scott Cunningham."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good to hear you Mr. Sheik!","review":"This is to me the best of Duncan's albums. If you're into singer-songwriter music, this is definatively the album to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice \\"read,\\" but not as personal as his previous work","review":"I'm a huge DS fan, and when I saw this CD at the store I pounced on it immediately.I was half hoping it would be something more in the vein of his first album. It's not, but that doesn't mean it's bad.When I listen to this album I feel as if I'm reading Walt Whitman: understandable if you notice that the lyrics were writen by playwright Steven Sater. There's only one song that gives you that angst-ridden feeling of the first album: \\"This Is How My Heart Heard.\\" The others are nice and stimulating, both in the musical and intellectual sense, but they don't draw you in like DS's previous works."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Phantom Moon\\"","review":"Duncan Sheik is remembered for his pop ditty \\"Barely Breathing\\" from a couple of years back. Erase the slate: turns out he got a bad rap. \\"Phantom Moon\\" is decidedly uncommercial, and accessible only on its own terms, which is how it should be. Nothing from this record will make it to radio, but the best music usually doesn't, of course. Simply put, it's a breath of fresh air. Sheik weaves a shroud of mystery around every track, like he's keeping secrets we all should be killing for. He's found his muse under a Phantom Moon. Beautiful album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely brilliant!","review":"In my humble opinion, this is Duncan's finest album. I don't care that he didn't write the lyrics; he still manages to sing all thirteen songs with emotion and honesty. Each track is beautiful and memorable in its own way. A must-have for any devoted Duncan Sheik fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Dreams","review":"How can anyone write a review on a record they have not yet heard? Are 30 second sound bytes all we need to base a review on? That's frightening. Anyway, I HAVE heard the record all the way through more than once and so I feel that I can write a review based on fact! The record is beautifully written, recorded and produced. I don't believe he is trying to be Nick Drake, nor do i believe that he has listened too much. At least he hasn't been listening to too much of what is currently on the radio. I find the album a refreshing change and I give him much respect for having the strength of conviction to put a record like this out in today's market. It is a pure honest record, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone, it is a reminder of how good music once was and how good it can once again be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely different--All symphonic","review":"Admittedly, I was disappointed at first, because I was expecting something along the lines of his first two. This is more \\"easy listening\\" than pop, not to say that there is anything wrong with it. I can't listen to it while driving because it will put me to sleep. However, I can listen to it at home all the time--it's very relaxing and nice. My favorites: Requisicat and Mr. Chess. They're all very good, but again, not what one expects after the first two CD's. However, he's still a Q-T-PI!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHEIK FALLS INTO THE DEPTHS OF DEPRESSION","review":"Sheiks latest effort \\"Phantom Moon\\" goes deeper and deeper into his dark side.I have to disagree with the rest of the critics regarding \\"Barely Breathing\\" which was his catchiest song, and strongest effort to date next to \\"She Runs Away\\" and \\"Serena\\".His next effort got progressively worse and boring with \\"Humming\\", and the record buyers ran away in droves, and it shows here again in \\"Phantom Moon\\".I am sorry but I like the POP side of Duncan Sheik, and I still can't believe that \\"Barely Breathing\\" almost didn't make it to his album. Its a classy pop song that will stand the test of time.Here on \\"Phantom Moon\\" there are no stand out songs, hooks, just dismal, depressing, wallowing in pity songs.I say Sheik get off your Jack Kerouac stage and start writing some catchier tunes. I give it (2) stars because Duncan has an incredible voice and the production, though I didn't like the music is first rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duncan can't pull this one off for me!","review":"I respect Duncan Sheik. His self-titled debut was great and he seems to really care more about his art than his wallet. \\"Phantom\\" fell short in a number of areas for me. Many of the melodies seem recycled and Sater's lyrics weren't inspiring enough to hold my attention. To me, this a collection of sophis- ticated camp songs -picturesque in presentation but lacking in substance. Some of the stuff reminds me of that dreadful overlong dirge on \\"Humming\\" called \\"Nichiren\\". That said,I'm glad I picked this cd up in a used bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music written by a person who thinks he is above us all...","review":"This album is a huge disappointment. The lyrics are inaccessible, and listening to this record is like listening to a little kid trying to \\"show off\\" how intellectual he/she is. What we dish out is always reciprocated, though. The album never even charted (meaning it has not even sold 5,000 units). Thus, Mr. Sheik will likely be dropped from Atlantic. Even records on subsidiary labels such as NONESUCH are supposed to turn a profit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I was very disappointed in this CD. You need to be on prozac after you are finished listening to it. His previous releases are way better than this. Boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom Moon Soars","review":"This is without a doubt the most emotionally affecting new pop album I've heard in many years. Sheik's songwriting has established a new benchmark, and his soulful singing of Sater's exquisite lyrics make for a true classic. Unlike anything else out there. It restores your faith in the power of songwriting, and leaves you with a bigger feeling of your own heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...

However, it is pretty important to note two things. The first is that it took 6 weeks for me to actually receive the book. Second, the cover and interior of the book are reversed and upside down. This means that unless i remove the cover myself people in class think that I'm reading the book upside-down. I would send the book back, but the semester is nearly a third complete as it is.

Just pretty pictures.
