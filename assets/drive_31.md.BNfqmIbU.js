This is old software (as others have noted). This software is VPN05L. For Windows 7 you need to buy the newer software VPNG05L. Fortunately, Amazon's return policy is very good so this didn't turn into an expensive mistake. However, Amazon should update the description so that other people don't fall into the same trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere, unless you need a new hobby","review":"Amazon did a fine job of distributing this product, but sadly, the product and the support is a mess. I have very good IT support personnel who have spent far too many hours trying to manage this software and its associated hardware. Netgear's customer support, if you find a CS staff member who doesn't elect to hang up on you, seems generally unaware that they market a software product at all, let alone this specific product. Anticipate the level of support you could provide under those circumstances and act accordingly."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst VPN software I have ever used","review":"Stay away from this product. It requires a degree in network security to even understand its terminology. There's no \\"common settings\\" feature that would allow you to easily set it up with say, one of Netgear's own products, like the ProSafe VPN firewall that we tried to use it with. You have to understand every tiny detail of VPN operation to get it to work which we never ended up doing. And of course, the help is helpless.If you need an easy, small office VPN solution, pay for the Himachi service from LogMeIn which doesn't require any hardware and was easy to get working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This software was not what I expected.

The author over-simplified the subject matter for my taste. This is not for someone with an analytical mind or with any kind of interest in nutritional science. It is a puff piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!!!!","review":"I purchased this book after waiting for 2 years. Marilu gave this book so much hype, that I thought that it would tell me something different than what was already out there. I wish that I could get a refund on this book. I do not make it a practice to give a negative review, but this book was not worth the money!!!! This book did not live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a must read if you want to reclaim your health!","review":"Marilu's book is insightful, hopeful, and very easy to both read, and follow. I like how she provides comprehensive information, and yet allows the reader to incorporate these tips in a logical, and comfortable manner. The books is excellent if you are ready to reclaim your total health!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound...Logical...Evolutionary...Radical","review":"Marilu offers some radical advice on health, yet as I read it, it made sense. I've been interested in health for many years, and never seemed to identify with what nutritionists and doctors believed and promoted. I studied evolution in college and know what man subsisted on prehistorically, and I know that in order to feel our best, we should emulate that diet. It did not have caffeine, dairy, alcohol, chemicals and excess sugar. I am 27, very busy, yet have no trouble living this. I jumped into it head on. Gave up caffeine, sugar, and dairy cold turkey. It was not as big a deal as I expected it to be, and my energy level has skyrockted. Friends and co-workers are asking about the \\"spring in my step\\". It is a radical change, but if you're ready to feel exceptional, it's easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Appointed Health Authority","review":"Why buy a health book written by an actress? All her information has been gotten second hand and therefore not reliable. I enjoyed her before and after pictures so she does have a personal success story but that's about it. Buy something written by an authority on health. The book seemed to have the reliability of an infomercial. I'd skip this read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult to follow","review":"Again, another celebrity with more money than God telling us what we should and shouldn't eat. This plan is NOT for the frugal. To buy soy products instead of dairy, be prepared to fork out twice the money. And food combining? Come on! Maybe if we all had personal chefs like Marilu we would have the time for that. One of her ideas was not eating starch with a protein. I gave it up, becuase that would mean giving up any and every type of sandwich!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a Break!!!","review":"First of all, I love Marilu Henner, but this book is a joke for us \\"normal people\\" who have to go to normal grocery stores and don't have cooks to prepare everything for us. When I read the \\"what to stock your pantry with\\" I just laughed. Wheat-free bread, Free-range chicken, non-dairy pudding, rice, cheese, lentel rice loaf, the ridiculous list goes on and on. Even if I could find these items, which I can't, I am not going to pay 3 times the money for it to taste like the chapter on poop. If you don't have a job and have nothing better to do than fly around the country trying to find everything you can eat, this book is for you, but if you're a normal person who doesn't have time to mess around, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh please!","review":"i love marilu henner to death ,but please! no caffeine, no dairy, no meat, no sugar, no white flour, what the heck does this woman eat? i am shocked to see this book received so many stars! i dont see how anyone could live on this diet, or even find the ingredients she suggests you use. this was insane, i have read them all and this was the worse!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Will change your life--if you are ready","review":"The reason I like this book so much is that it is about getting healthy--not getting thin. You may not agree with everything she says, but if you are willing to try some of the steps, you will feel and look better than you ever have in your life. The weight loss follows the healthy living. The book itself could be written a little better, but she seems to have done her homework. Don't try to do all the steps at once, this is about making over your life, which of course does not happen overnight. This is a refreshing break from the high protein, low carb fad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Marilu as an actress but . . .","review":"Why should I believe any of this \\"research\\"? After all, Marilu is an actress, not a nutritionist or medical doctor. Her complaints against dairy products sound like a boring repeat of Susan Powter's opinion in \\"Food.\\" Very few people will want to follow her extreme program, even if they could understand it. I don't know why so many people rated the book highly and then said they didn't understand the program. To me this is just another \\"extreme\\" diet that may or may not be healthy in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought it, took it back.","review":"All the steps listed in her book are based on common sense, and your ability to cut some foods completely out of your diet. I also noticed that in the limited number of recipies in the back that everything was organic. I live in Colorado where food is expensive to begin with, and orgnic is VERY expensive. I want a plan that I can follow, where I'm not already at a disatvantage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah for Dairy Free!!!","review":"Finally a way to live Dairy Free- I have had so many problems and when I finally discovered how to live dairy free- Thanks to Marilu. The book talks to you like a good friend- not a doctor who talks above you. She has also written lots of follow up books to help you even more with recipes and holidays. Her website marilu.com is the biggest help and she offers wonderful online classes that support all of her program. She is full of energy and common sense advice. She has a wonderful on-line community where there is lots of support and Marilu is very involved. Marilu and her Total Health Makeover have changed my life. Thank you!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely more than the typical celebrity health book!","review":"What a great book! Lots of new ideas (to me), obviously well researched, and very logically and clearly explained. Plus, she has a great warmth and sense of humor that really comes through. I've just taken the first step of cutting dairy products out of my diet, and plan to implement the steps I'm not already doing very soon. I'm very excited! Hey Marilu! How about a cookbook?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great energy, makes you move to live!!","review":"I have always looked for ways to eat right Mary Lou has tapped The nutrition out look! I wish I could thank her personally!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book offers a \\"make-sense\\" approach to eating-no diets!","review":"To see Marilu Henner on TV is a testamony as to the affectiveness of this manner of eating. This book along with any of the others she recommends in the back may change your eating habits forever. You will surely drop the word \\"diet\\" from your vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one but buy the 30-day Total Health Makeover","review":"The first of Marilu's books, this one is padded with mumbo-jumbo and pseudo-science. The following book - 30-Day Total Health Makeover - repeats the truly essential information and provides a useful plan for a healthy diet. The recipes are tasty and healthful, and put you on track for both weight loss and a better diet without added sugar, red meat and dairy. Plus, because it contains both protein and carbs, the plan does not leave you famished. Head straight for the second book and when you're through the 30 days, get the Healthy Life Kitchen for more recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL book!!","review":"This book is written for the average person to read!! It is not a book of facts and boring statistics, but a personal life story that is far more interesting than reading a boring nutritional science book! A person can't go wrong by eliminating chemicals and pesticides from their body. If there were two equally priced products side by side, one grown with pesticides and the other grown organically, which one would go untouched? Who would want to knowingly poison their body? Much of the food sold is not safe and people need to wake up and start realizing that. Start buying organic and the prices will come down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has changed my life!","review":"This is an intelligent, informative, fun and extremely helpful book. Marilu has done the work of reading, researching and trial-and-error, and we benefit from it! She writes in such a way as to not only teach, but entertain. This book is very clear and explains WHY we need to do certain things. I've heard some of the things written about in here before, but never really understood how it would help me. Now I get it! I learned so much and have been on her plan for 7 weeks and lost 20 lbs. I also FEEL so much better! This is something that can be a lifelong change. It's not a \\"diet\\", as diets don't really work. The book is not only about food and eating, but about many other health issues. So much information in one book! Thank you Merilu, this book and you have changed my life for the better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly, but good","review":"These are great to listen too. However, they do get old fast.

I highly recommend it, especially if you are an audio learner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish sound effects are louder than review material","review":"Childish sound effects are louder than review material and often played over the worth full review material. Perhaps they intend to sell this product to kindergartners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comedy is very distracting","review":"I bought this after reading another reviewer complain about how incredibly distracting their poor attmept at mixing some comedy in with the MCAT information was... I bought anyway thinking \\"how distracting could it actually be?\\" Well... the sound effects that are added in for I guess a comedic slant and the \\"dumb guy / smart guy\\" way of presenting the material is sooooo distracting I can't stand to even listen to the CDs. It is horrible - what's worse is that this would be a good study review if these guys would lay off these sound effects and poor attempts at jokes that have nothing to do with learning or reviewing the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis","review":"I travel in my car many hours with my job, so it works great for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much information! Not professionally done","review":"I took the MCAT and had the opportunity to listen to this series. I was not impressed with the manner in which they narrated the information or the cost. Also, it was way too much information to be high yield. I would say this was not worth my money and would just prefer to take a course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I waited exactly 3 weeks to get my purchase. When I did receive it, it was broken and missing discs. I have tried to contact the seller without any response. I am very disappointed with my order and with amazon for not getting back to me quickly about the terrible order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent of prep for MCAT","review":"These 12 CDs are excellent for prep for MCAT. Because of these CDs, my score went from a 22 (6v, 7ps, 9bs) to a 26 (7v,9ps,10bs). This may not seem like its that good of an improvement, but I did almost no other studying besides listening to these CDs. The physics and gem chem sections are the best because they explain the subjects conceptually, which helps enormously on the real mcat. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE! Terrible Long Island Accents and Annoying Over the Top Sound Effects!","review":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible. I've tried many times to listen to any subject for more than half an hour while driving to or from work and I just can't do it. Too many annoying little sound effects really disrupts the concentration, especially due to the fact that the effects are far louder than their voices. Jordan is hard to listen to because of his Looooong Island accent. He should never say the words all (\\"ole\\") or water (\\"woater\\") again.Also, for some strange reason, 3 or 4 of the 8 discs are dedicated to physics, which is a very minor aspect of the physical science on the MCAT while Biology is only covered on a 1 disc, but comprises an entire third of the MCAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"extra help for mcat prep","review":"This seems like a good way to review. I have taken the mcat once (w/o audio osmosis) and am studying to take it again. So far, I've listened to the discs once through, and I think that being able to hear concepts while at work or on the train to/from work will help cement them in addition to reading, reviewing, and taking practice tests. DO NOT think you'll ace the mcat w/o practice tests, but it's an amusing set of discs with some good sound effects, asides, and mnemonics to help commit concepts to memory. I'm pretty confident it should help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad jokes take away from learning","review":"Although they do a comprehensive review of materials, I was not satisfied with the product for a number of reasons.Firstly, the ridiculous sound effects and terrible (and I mean geared at a 7 year old level) jokes, really detract from learning the material. Seriously, what were these guys thinking when they made this?Secondly, there are a lot of mistakes in it (see other review for details).Finally, there is an imbalanced overview of the material with a large proportion dedicated to Physics compared to Bio."},{"rating":"2","title":"MCAT Audio Osmosis","review":"Examkrackers MCAT Audio Osmosis with Jordan and Jon is a good complement along with MCAT review books, but alone it will not fully prepare you for the MCAT. Also, I found the jokes and wacky sound effects distracting me from the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing ever!!!","review":"I absolutely love this product.Not only is it useful for MCAT but any other standardized test that involves sciences.It's just a helpful tool for any student in the science and healthcare field wishing to review some basic sciences.I put each CD on my iphone and listen to them throughout the day and they have really helped me!I love it!I'm preparing for dental school and my fiance is preparing for medical school and we both have gained great benefit from this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love their books, Audio is not bad.","review":"Using Examkrackers books and Audio Osmosis study guide, my MCAT score jumped 4 points from a 32 to a 36.Good to listen to while doing mind-numbing work, or running, or sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bit hard to judge veracity ... but seems a lifesaver!","review":"It is a bit hard to rate this book, since I have no expert knowledge as to its veracity or not, and that is really the crux of this book. The advice sounds true, but I don't know for sure ... do any of us? (Remember 'Duck and Cover'?) I would recommend that most every American who lives and/or works in a likely target (e.g. any large-sized metropolitan city) read what this book says, though, and commit it to memory. This is one of those books that, having read free online (Rand makes it available online free at http://www.rand.org/publications/MR/MR1731/), I am going to also purchase, mostly for the reference card available at the end. As someone who spends 8-10 hours per day in the nation's second largest major metropolitan center (Chicago), I would rather have this information handy in card form should the worst ever happen. Call me paranoid, but I'd rather have it and not need it, rather than needing it and not having it ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Movie","review":"The movie was very boring. Fair game didn't keep my attention. I thought the movie supposed to be slightly funny but i was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why??","review":"I write this review as I struggle to make myself finish watching this movie. I've talked myself out of stopping it about 3 or 4 times, but I'm no quitter I'm going to persevere until the end. The story line is so disjointed and the characters are disappointingly one dimensional. I've watched some really good independent black films like Love, Sex and Eating the Bones or 30 to Life, but Fair Game so far has been a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever.","review":"I try to support African American movies but when they put out garbage like this I have to let my displeasure be known. The plot was stupid and there was absolutely no chemistry whatsover between the main characters. Even the attempts at comedy were horrible. There was nothing about the characters that made you want to invest in the characters or the storyline. I just wanted the movie to be over with because I kept waiting for something to happen that would make me find some redeemable factor in this movie but nothing. Bad actors, bad acting, bad directing, and terrible writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"By and large, a waste of time.","review":"The beginning is very well done, then the only interesting parts are the cat-and-mouse between Jude Law and Ed Harris. The rest of the film is bad, I'd say. Luckily, I recorded it from TV. It is now erased. (By the way, one of the Amazon reviewers who also disliked the film wrote that Bob Hoskins is American. He's from England.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest War Movie Of Our Time","review":"This is a great movie . I loved this movie . It is so great .

I just love it . Its my favorite war movie of all time ."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Costume and No Drama","review":"This is a big-budget Costume Drama that is All Costume and No Drama. It wastes very good actors (Ed Harris, Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, Bob Hoskins) on a very thin script and very lavish production-values. There is hardly any suspense, and it's a pity to see actors try so hard with so little to work with. The high point is seeing how much Bob Hoskins looks like Kruschev. We used to hear that the personal is political; this movie takes the opposite position, that all politics is merely personal. Pretty ham-handed and silly; and you can see the actors squirming to deliver their lines. Propagandistic and tiresome; but visually beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rarely seen angle of WWII . . .","review":"I love this movie. It is great to see Hollywood crank out a WWII movie set in the Soviet Union.The duel between two oposing snipers in the war becomes a perfect simile for the dynamic struggle of two countries, ideologies, and style of propaganda.Of course, there are complaints about its historical accuracy. As you can imagine, Hollywood is more bent on entertaining than educating. . . and as long as it doesn't grossly cross that line (i.e. Pearl Harbor) is a nice way to expose many people to the significant events of history.If you want perfect accounts of history, read a book... and anyway, I'm not even sure history authors tell the whole truths either.The biggest problem I had with the factual hiccups of this film is quite minor actually.... I find it rather silly that Russian soldiers speak with English accents.... and German soldiers with American ones...If you can get past that however, you'll love the beautiful scenery, the great sound and story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well concived","review":"This movie is eye candy and no one should miss the first 20 minutes however after this it seems to get stuck in the middle. I have some problems with this movieA. The lack of Russian and German accents the movie would have been 5 stars if you didn't have Jude Law dropping back into Cornish every 5 secoundsB. The plot holes like what happens to message about Vasily after Danalov writes it? (The DVD did a good job clearing that one up)C.

Fully accurate or not, how refreshing to have a war hero without an ego. Was the intention to give a full history lesson or to focus on the intriguing game of cat and mouse of the opposing sharpshooters Vassily Zaitzev(Jude Law)and the German Major Konig (Ed Harris)with the battle for Stalingrad as the backdrop. If you want a history lesson get a documentry.Great performances all round."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for sharp shooting only","review":"Just another Hollywood love story wrapped in pseudo-Russian atmosphere.The actors have nothing in common with Russians and Russian history.

The script makes a smart choice by focusing on the tale of the younger Russian, including his friends (Fiennes) and loves (Weisz) to make a more sympathetic character. By doing this and witholding the same character build-up of Mr. Harris' character (who gets due service by what the script does NOT tell us ... a good case of \\"less is more\\"). The intensity of the four lead performances, combined with real locations, a strong supporting cast, a strong script, a true story, and the solid directing job by Jean-Jacques Annaud makes for a very good film. It does not reach the heights of PLATOON or THE THIN RED LINE, but it is still an awfully good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"Great scenery but the acting, whewwww! Who wrote the dialoge?... I do give the actors their due, they did the best with what they were given. And the action sequences, did't they have anyone who has every heard a gun fire. Sniper rifles don't go pop, they ROAR when you fire them. And tanks give a report that rips the air, not a puff!

It depicts neither the character, nor the spirit, nor the soul, nor the mindset of the people. Forget the real events and characters. It is about an imaginary people invented by hollywood.This pure fantasy-fiction farce presents a medley, in one bowl, of situations taken from different places and periods of the war, an ignorant-tourist gift set like balalaika, nesting doll, bottles of vodka (glass bottles in the trenches?), and, of course, typical western fare of \\"Russian\\" \\"cannon fodder for the officers\\". Also, the Russians are to blame themselves for the massacre in the territories occupied by the Nazis and the loss of soldiers on the front.This continued hollywood trip along the path of rewriting the history of the war more than fifty years after its end is an insult. It is not about my grandparents who fought in the war since the first day of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame","review":"I was very disappointed with the movie \\"Enemy at the Gates.\\" I believe my disappointment is based on the fact that I enjoyed the book very much, and the way the producer/director chose to change charater motivations in the movie ruined a very well-written story.I am often disappointed when a book I thoroughly enjoy is made into a movie; I have once more learned my lesson and will leave movie watching to those who lack good reading abilities"},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts great, goes wrong","review":"I suppose I'm churlish for not liking this movie. Not having seen ads or reviews and not having read the book, I was misled by the opening sequences into thinking that this was a movie about the battle of Stalingrad. The opening sequences are very effective and impressively nightmarish in showing that \\"war is hell,\\" a message one can't hear too often.Then it all goes dreadfully wrong, as the viewer is expected to be interested in a farfetched cat-and-mouse game between two snipers. This is such small potatoes compared to the start of the movie that I turned it off in disgust. As with virtually all \\"hit man\\" movies, I quickly lose interest in \\"who kills who?\\" as the body count increases. But I guess if you liked Pulp Fiction, you may like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good and the bad","review":"I thought this movie was great to watch and I definetly want to own it, But at times there were some unrealistic scenes. For example, there is a sex scene, which at that time would have never happened (especially during a war). I understand that for it to be a drama, hollywood probably has rules about adding things like that. The movie still had suspence though. Although it doesnt capture the true story of the sniper and the war in Russia, It does give a rough look to audiences who are not up on their history. In other words, if you want the true story look it up in a book or on the history channel and one will notice that the movie is slightly off. All in all, I still enjoyed this movie. When my boyfriend took me to see it I thought it would be a guy movie, but it turned out to be pretty good. I think everyone should see it at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and insulting WARNING: SPOILERS","review":"This movie is about as accurate as a blind man firing a zip gun. It deviates about as far as you can get from the truth and still be talkng about the same war, much less front. Almost every aspect of this movie is completely wrong. I would list them all except I would exceed the 1,000 words limit. But one very sore point: the bastardization of the ending. The girl steps on a land mine and dies from organ failure in real life. Not this crap ending of the movie. ARGH! If you want a reasonably accurate version of this story, go and buy War of the Rats. It's a book. You read it.

Then a nazi sniper (Ed Harris) is also good just as Vassili are becoming enemies in this fast paced war thriller.Directed by Jean Jacques Annaud (Quest for Fire, The Bear, The Name of the Rose) made an strong terrific drama, almost Based on a Fact.

It was much better than expected originally. The developers managed to create a drama moreso than just a \\"shoot em up blood and guts\\". They even threw in a little seedy romance. I recommend this movie, particularly to those with an eye to history or the History Channel. Very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie.","review":"This DVD is beautiful. The picture, the sound, the clarity. The movie is something that I find interesting. It's about the only movie based on the Eastern Front of WWII. It deals with a true story. It is basically a sniper movie, but it's a war movie at heart.So what makes this movie so good? A combination of things. First off, the acting is excellent. All the way from the up-and-coming Jude Law to the very underrated Ed Harris. Second, the image the movie puts in your head of what war is like is second only to Saving Private Ryan. There are many more reasons to get this DVD.Okay, enough of all these compliments. Now the complaints. About my only complaint is the love story. I'm not a big fan of love stories in war movies. But, this one seems to pull it off pretty good.So, if you want a good movie, get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Battle of Stalingrad movie.","review":"For those of you who like WWII movies do not overlook this gem! It tells the story of snipers in the Battle of Stalingrad. It shows memorable battle sequences (both infantry and sniper). It does well with a fictionalized account of the historical sniper duel of the Russian Sniper, Vasily Grigoryevich Zaytsev and Nazi Sniper Erwin König. It also shows female Russian snipers (They existed and were as tough and skilled as their male counterparts, ex: Lyudmila Mykhailivna Pavlichenko) One big plus in this movie is they actually got the scope right! Instead of blacking out a ring and putting crosshairs on a screen. You are actually seeing what a sniper would be seeing. 5/5 Great Movie, must watch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound didn't work so well","review":"Sound kept going in and out had to restart my system 3 times to get it to work.

Now, this movie is not completely historically accurate, but why let that diminish what is a great work of cinematography?There are many reasons why I love this movie, chief among this being the music that James Horner composes, one of the only movie soundtracks that I have purchased. Another reason is how well the action and violence is portrayed. It casts a stark and indifferent light to how unforgiving something as horrible as war is, and does well to express that horror to a viewer whom (more than likely) has not experienced such a travesty.The last thing I think I would have to mentioned are the actors, which perform their roles with a genuine feel that accentuates the tense foreboding of their character's times.A great, great movie. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys war movies, or well made movies in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemy at the gates","review":"Awesome movie, graphic as it gets.

I watched this film wondering how Jean-Jaques Annaud keeps getting backers for his projects. From the utterly boring \\"Seven Years in Tibet\\" to this overblown piece of junk he proves over and over that he is a sub-par filmaker who cannot sustain suspense and has a hard time with character development. Although technically proficient, the film was not the least bit compelling and the characters motives are as blurry as a stained glass.

Another hollywood war movie.","review":"There is little positive to say about this movie. It does show a different front of world war II, which is always an interesting diversion from the typical 'Mericans vs. Nazi or Japanese plot. Also, choosing to focus on a sniper other than a generic soldier was a cool concept. Unfortunately, that's where the positives end.Actors who are suppose to be Russian or German don't speak their respective language, AND speak in English with British/American accents. Rough transition between scenes and plot points left me wondering \\"wait, did I miss something?\\". Shallow characters that make me feel indifferent whether they lived or died. A stupid, stupid love triangle that took focus away from the overall plot and served as a cue for over dramatic, generic score. Predictable battles, predictable ending, overall lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemy at the Gates","review":"This was a really intense and interesting movie.

The nudity scene was unneccessary.The portion of the film devoted to Kruchev shows just how much of a dispical man he was.

It should have focused entirely on the cat and mouse tactics employed by the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Soviet Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), both snipers trying to bring the other out into the open. However, the film constantly shifts focus between the Soviet propaganda officer (Joseph Fiennes) and female Soviet soldier (Rachel Weisz) in a ridiculous love triangle. This totally destroys the pace of the film and detracts from its main subject. By the time of the denouement there is no emotion felt. The characters, the two protagonists, are never given any real depth to lend meaning to their actions and motivations. The only emotion felt, is delivered by James Horner's score during the scenes when the two men actually do confront each other. This film is an example of a lost opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much propaganda, too little truth.","review":"Some facts are taken from the real history, then exaggerated, distorted or falsified. Russians would have never won this one of the greatest battles in the world history if they were such idiots as they are shown in this movie. The only worthy episode in the film is the strange sexy scene between main characters. The principal actors play OK. Especially I liked Ed Harris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enemy of \\"Enemy at the Gates\\"","review":"A good movie subject, but a poor movie. Should have skipped the love story and focused more on the battle. Seemed too upbeat at points for a war movie. Didn't let you get too involved in the story. Not suspensfull enough for a story of two snipers fighting each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"the eastern front - the REAL reason why Germany lost","review":"Not seeing much of the Eastern Front portrayed in movies, I found it fascinating. I mean, both countries fighting are ruthless and aggressive and basically run by evil men. It's weird, we usually see good versus bad in war movies like this (meaning, America vs Whoever Else), so it was hard to take my eyes away from fighting armies who have no regard for human life on either side. Not that this is what the movie is REALLY about. We all know it's about sniper versus sniper, and I agree with the other reviewer that it's about the PEOPLE involved, how they deal with existing in a surreal war environment like this. What drags the movie a little IS the romantic subplot, but the other subplot about the German sniper and the Russian boy was actually very interesting. Not the greatest war movie, but certainly fresh and much needed. Whenever I watch it playing on a movie channel, I can't take my eyes off it. I suppose I should buy the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least they got the city right.","review":"unfortunately i had to give it one star, it deserves none. not since the movie \\" battle of the bulge \\" have i seen a film miss it's claim \\" the true story \\" so badly. the constant time-outs for the rest of the men in stalingrad when the snipers were hunting, seeking out their trophies, or as in the end, out in the open where they would have been cut down by any one of the hundreds, thousands, etc. of others there. good idea to tell the story of stalingrad , but at least come close to the truth. another story that fans of true history should beg speilberg and hanks to do. they seem to have gotten their last effort right( band of brothers ). the bulge would be a good one for them too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow typical Russian pain and suffering","review":"Sorry, I read the high ratings but the movie lacked interest, action and empathy.

I suggest you RENT BUT DON'T BUY"},{"rating":"1","title":"good bot not great","review":"This was a good movie, but it could have been so much better. The British accents were a big disappointment for me, they really took away alot of realism. They could have done it Red October style, with the Russians actually speaking Russian, then do a close up of the mouth, then you hear english. With British accents I'm expecting John Cleese and Michael Palin to come out and do the \\"Parrot Sketch\\". Visually the beginning of the movie was the best part, the chaos and horror of war is right there in your face. then we focus on 2 snipers, as if the battle for Stalingrad depends on them, not likely. The child character was very corny. A British Brady kid if I ever saw one. And was the stupid love triangle really neccassary. Its soul purpose was to attract more females to movie, nothing more. All in all this movie gets 1 star for bieng visually amazing, but the rest was awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about realism?","review":"I feel awkward stating this, but I honestly found no realism in the movie Enemy at the Gates. Sure, this was a great movie for passing the time, great action, fine acting, and so forth. The truth is the whole plotline is false, not that they ever truly claim it to be based on a true story. He is one soldier, one of millions in Soviet army. They sadly idolize Zaitsev as the hero of Soviet. The truth was, there would be little knowledge of him around Soviet Union at the time. Maybe the area sure, but the truth was the movie acted as if he would turn the war around."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 Minutes Of Action Crammed Into 2 1/2 Hours.....","review":"Formulaic. Dull.

Was Koenig (played by Ed Harris) an American who defected to Germany? No one commented on his utter lack of any accent or effort to even make an accent up. Jude Law is an excellent actor, but hey, if youre such a highly trained actor where was your linguist coach too? I wasnt aware that Russians also had English accents. The movie itself (although hardly historically correct) wasnt too bad. Unfortunately, it was the director who ruined it. He should have insisted these actors try to use or get dialect coaching to bring more realism to it. I just couldnt bring myself to believe that I was watching a real German sniper going after a Russian one. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this is rediculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chickflick alert","review":"Judging from the trailer, I thought this was going to be another film in the mould of Saving Private Ryan, except with the action taking place on the eastern front in Stalingrad. I should have known better. With heart-throb duo, Jude Law and Joseph Fiennes heading up the cast with their dreamy looks, Enemy at the Gates is not really war movie at all but a far-fetched, wafer-thin romantic \\"chickflick\\" with a few battle scenes thrown in to provide the historical setting. They shouldn't have bothered. I was bitterly disappointed. It starts promisingly enough but after about half an hour leaves you fumbling for the vom bucket. I hope Pearl Harbour isn't as bad as this, which is the kind of thing that makes you want to watch the entire Sam Pekinpah back-catalogue in one sitting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alarming wartime enactment","review":"Enemy at the Gates contained some of the most authentic and horrific wartime footage since Spielberg's masterpiece, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\". The attack by Nazi fighter planes on Russian soldiers crossing the Volga river by boat was particularly disturbing in it's effectiveness. The wartime settings depicting war time Stalingrad was first rate.The story revolves around the pitting of the top Nazi sniper, played by Ed Harris against the propagandized top Soviet sniper played by Jude Law. The battle of wits between the 2 is played out very nicely. There is also a love triangle played out between Law, Soviet political officer Joseph Fiennes (excellent as usual) and Soviet soldier Rachel Weisz. This proves to be too syrupy for my own taste.As is usual with contemporary films, this one runs about 20 minutes too long. Incidently, Bob Hoskins is chillingly effective as Nikita Khruschev."},{"rating":"2","title":"There must be a God...","review":"Yes, it must have taken Divine Intervention to get a major movie producer to gamble on Nazi's vs. Communists. And where better to face them off than in Stalingrad? The movie admirably portrays two men, being used as pawns by their own repective totalitarian regimes, to win in a deadly sniper duel. The duel is essenitally a microcosm for the epic battle of Stalingrad, where close to a million souls died to claim possession to about 20 square miles of rubble. The German wartime arrogance and Russian wartime patriotism are well done in this film. Personally, I think Ed Harris' chemistry with young Sasha was Oscar caliber...though I'm sure that nobody in Hollywood will ever notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemy at the Gates","review":"This a gritty well acted and directed down in the mud and guts story set in WWII.

In reading the other reviews, I would have to say that they tend to be dead on - the movie jumps from frenzied war scenes filled with violence to the one on one cat and mouse game played between the two snipers - Zeitzev and Koening - where it seems the war and time stands still. The love triangle and the over the top portrayal of Nikita Kruschev are probaby the biggest detractions from the story line, but they also provide enough entertainment value as to not pull too much from the main story line. If you have interest in the Second World War, this story will intice you - it is one of the very few movies made about the Eastern Front, and the equipment, cinematography and setting are first rate.

However it is not really the siege itself that is the focus but the battle between two famous snipers. The russian sniper Vassily Zaitsev and Nazi Major Konig. I had always thought that Russia's involvement in WWII would have made for some great films and after seeing this film I'm not overly dissapointed. Historical accuracy is once again thrown out by Hollywood but the central focus in the film remains the same as that in which it was in real life; that the central character Vassily Zaitsev brings hope and inspiration to his fellow soldiers by his skill as a marksman."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down","review":"I waited for this movie to come out when I first heard about it, and even bought the book.

Though it was pretty brief, still it could of done without. Trust me, love and war don't mix. It was definitely worth seeing and I highly recommend it. The war scenes (Sharpshooter scenes in paticular) were incredible. It seemed pushing to the end each and every one of the main characters were taken down one by one.

I would definitely recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enemy at the Gates","review":"For a 20 year old boy from Mexico the common war movies are the Rambo series and many others where the Soviet Army or Red Army are the bad boys, and you grow up with this idea. But when i read on a magazine the filming of this movie i was not expected to be one of my favourites because the story is about a young Soviet sniper who became in 9 days a national hero and the chase of his counterpart an experimented German marksman.In first place i don't belive it was a good movie because Saving Private Ryan is (for say) the actual war epic movie but when i see it i just found a new war epic movie form a battle who was the most bloddy of all: the siege of Stalingrad. the cast include good actors like Jude Law in the play of the Hero Vassili Zaitsev and Ed Harris the role of the Major Edwig Koenig and one of the most beauties actress of this times Rachel Weisz on the role of Tania Chernova.You will enjoy this movie. belive me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I really enjoy this movie.I realize that it has historical inaccuracies (i.e. Red Army regulars forced into a suicide charge at the film's beginning), but I dig this flick nonetheless.I also enjoy the Romantic aspects of the movie too.

The movie actually follows more closely the novel, War of the Rats, by David L. Robbins. The novel is excellent and the start of the movie was such that I though we finally had a movie that was going to follow the book. But, alas, that was not to be. After the initial scenes it became the typical Hollywoodized war flick that mangled the book from which it was adapted. Some of the people were there but were it not for their names I'd have not known who they were supposed to be.If you're looking for a war movie with some impressive sets then you'll enjoy it but if you're looking to learn anything about the true battle of Stalingrad, forget it. This movie is at best worth the price of an evening's rental. That's how I first saw it and in my opinion it's worth no more than that and certainly isn't worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some theatrical licence taken, but still worth getting.","review":"Although the movie appears to take a fair amount of theatrical licence with the story line, it still manages to capture much of the essance of the battle of Stalingrad. Besides there aren't 2 books out there that agree on a lot of the details either so who knows......... I would have liked to have seen the ending of the sniper battle done a little more historically and the love triangle plot line detracted more than added to the story but over all it is a great movie. The other thing going for this movie is that it helps to show the American audience that there was more to WWII than the US vs Ger. or the US vs Japan. If you like war movies, or action movies, or suspense movies, You will not go wrong buying this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, but a little predictable","review":"I thought Enemy at the Gates was a fairly good movie, though a little predictable at times.

What bugs me the most is that every time this movie is mentioned saving private ryan is as well. It is by no means comparable to saving private ryan. The film is often slow and boring, after the opening few scenes the rest of film was a cat and mouse game between two snipers. Another problem with the film that made it hard to get excited about is the fact the main characters are supposed to be Russian's, but they speak with English accents. Not that the acting was bad I just couldn't get past the accents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deflated historical context","review":"This is maybe the most disappointing film by Annaud. Great history deflated to a boring love blahblah on war background in embarassingly badly crafted décor - reminds of Spartacus movies of the 50ies or the first Star Trek serials with plastic rocks flying around. Very listless. Dully played by most of the actors. If something is mud and dirty - must be Russian.

There was too much emphasis placed on the \\"love interest\\" part of the story and not enough on the actual battle itself. The duel between the snipers was good but because we have to sit through all the \\"love interest\\" parts the duel becomes overly long and towards the end you just want one of them to get shot so it will be over. Finally, when we do get to the climax of the duel it is heavily dipped in Hollywood instead of ending it the way it is written in the histories.As with so many war movies the director, even if the intention is to honor those who fought and died, seem to be saying,\\"Thanks for all your sacrifice, but wouldn't it have been better and more exciting if it had happened this way?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a drag! -talk about disappointing","review":"I couldn't wait to watch this film: it has Rachel Weisz, Ed Harris, Joe Fiennes and directed by the great director of Seven Years in Tibet and The Bear, what could go wrong, right? Well, everything is wrong in this film, the fight scenes are good enough, and the actors do a great job (specially Harris), but there's nothing to like about this flick: it all looks fake, the dialogues are flat, the scenes change without any order or logic (if both snipers stalked each other, how, after one of them shot somebody or something, how on earth did they return to their quarters so easily, how did they manage to cross enemy lines without being seen?). This is not a history lesson, I know, but this film shows one more time how easily impressionable and gullible, even, we -audiences- have become, how we have gotten used to watching mediocre films believing they are good, when they really stink."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice movie about World War II in Russia","review":"This movie is a remake of Ozerov's Angels of Death (highly recommended, available only in original version, so you have to understand Russian).For Westerners trying to make a \\"Russian movie\\", this is a great success.

This is a film about people in a situation beyond imaginaton. How these people survive, fight, and love in an environment where death can come at any minute is the true focus of the film. The point is to see how heroic in the face of insurmountable odds men and women can be.The film understates the brutality of the German forces and emphasizes the vicious discipline tatics of the Red Army. The Soviet soldiers were sent against machine guns with no weapons, no leadership, and apparently no real training.How hero(s) arise from this is the story. Others have focused on a love triangle in this story as a cliche, but on careful examination I think something else is going on between the young boy, the German, the girl and the political officer.

I think it was probably overlooked a bit. Jude Law, Joseph Fiennes, Ed Harris, and Rachel Weisz make a great team. The story is about a Russian sniper who gives hope to his people during the bloody German invasion. After loosing many soldiers, Hitler sends one of his elite snipers to hunt down and kill the Russian hero before the tide of war turns. It's an amazing film with plenty of action, suspense, and major drama. You really don't wanna miss Enemy at the Gates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The problem with this movie is that historical inaccuracies. If one is to make a movie based upon an actual event, it really should try to stick to what really happened. To make matters worse, great actors were stuck into bad parts and they seemed to just sleep-walk through the thing. Plus, Jude Law does a terrible Russian accent, when he even tries. Just a waste of time AND money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb contemporary production of the WW II Stalingrad seige","review":"Wow! Realism beyond compare in a great new war film about the WW II German invasion of Stalingrad.

One of the better war movies ever made actually. (Look for the drunk Russian soldier passing gas on a lit candle in the soldiers underground dormitory two thirds through, it's hilarious.) Experience Enemy at the Gates and you'll understand why I've commented so highly on it. Yes it may be a tad bit commercial but it still is must see vieweing.

I knew the combo, and actually tried many different combos with the hope of opening the bag. Several minutes before my court hearing, I asked the marshal for a pocket knife, and sliced open the strap to get to my client's file. The bag was ruined.I called McKlein and they refused to help me. They said the lock was not covered by the warranty. They refused to sew on a new strap, or even supply me with one.I can live with the lower quality leather.

Oh, it's real leather on top, but that's only skin deep. All along the vertical welts along the edges, which of course is where the action is, the thin layer of leather has rapidly worn off. Underneath is not unfinished raw leather, but some kind of black mush like you see when a cheap pair of \\"leather\\" shoes begins to wear away.This started to become obvious only a couple of weeks after the deadline for a full refund passed.

I bought this book thinking it would aid me in restoring my camaro. Instead, this book is nothing but a bunch of diagrams/clips taken from the books mentioned above but in much less detail.I am surprised the other two reviews were real positive because if you already have the factory manuals, it renders this book useless and quite lacking.

I did not care for Lauren Lee Smith as Christy, or Diane Ladd as Miss Alice. Smith was whiny and annoying, lacking the conviction Kellie Martin had. And Ladd, whose work I normally love, was very sloppy, slipping contractions into the otherwise refined Quaker way of speaking. Tyne Daly did so much better.

There really is no chemistry between the actors. They also take a real step back in the Christy character.

Not only were hardly any of the original actors in the movie, but the story went over ground already covered in the original series. I found it redundent and annoying.

In my heart, Kellie Martin is always the Christy I remembered in the smoky mountain who was willing to fight for her children and Rand was the pastor who shared God's love in whatever he said or did.All of the above was missing in the movies and to my worst nightmare, what the charactors portrayed was just the opposite!!! The only actor I like is Dr. Neil McNeil. Please bring back the original cast back to the film production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked and disappointed!","review":"I can't believe how much the quality of this series has gone downhill. Seeing someone other than Tyne Daly playing Miss Alice is almost enough to drive me to tears. No one can play Christy as effortlessly as Kellie Martin did.

So save your money and pre-order the set. If you already have the first seven seasons, wait. I am sure once the new set is on sale, the price for this movie will drop. Or order the new set and give the extra discs to someone as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homicide: Life on the Street","review":"Yes, the plot was pretty thin, and the final scene, I'm still ruminating about... but it was terrific to see all the characters again. There will never be another episode. BTW, I recently took a trip to Baltimore and visited the Fell Point area and yes the Rec Center is still there but fading fast, and The Waterfront has changed hands and just doesn't feel the same..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"In lieu of more colorful euphemisms, ugh will have to suffice. As a huge fan of Homicide, I have to strongly disagree with the raves about this movie. In direct contrast to those who praised this piece, I was highly disappointed and even affronted by it. Let me speak for the fans who love the show but thought this movie was meant more as a 'kiss-off' than a 'send-off'. It left me the distinct impression that Tom Fontana was bored with writing Homicide, and wanted to destroy any chance whatsoever that he would be forced to write the characters ever again. What better way to do that than by making Tim Bayliss a 'bad guy', and then by murdering Gee, thus destroying the guiding force of the squad? The final roof-top scene with Frank and Tim is some of the best acting you will ever see, but on the whole, I would have rathered this movie wasn't made at all. Homicide deserved a better ending than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful end for a great series","review":"I've been a huge fan, read the book, watched all the episodes when first run, and now purchased and watched all 7 seasons on DVD.The movie was simply terrible. The writing was bad. Melodrama at its worst. I wish I had never watched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Amazing. NECA has the best bobble heads, hands down. The detail is spectacular. Where other bobble head companies create bobbles which resemble (some well, others... Not so much) the character they're attempting to create, NECA creates lifelike, realistic replicas of the characters. This Napoleon Dynamite bobblehead is evidence of that fact. Great quality and durability. Fantastic addition for anyone who collects these things, and just as awesome for a casual fan of bobbleheads or the movie, Napoleon Dynamite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Shrews","review":"Saw this show over 42 yrs ago, as a child.

It basically gives a rought draft of the business itself and what is needed to get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating and cursory","review":"This book, while certainly full of useful information, was somewhat frustrating to read. I found that it did not delve deeply enough into the specifics of a WEDDING PLANNING business. I can (and have) bought numerous books specifically relating to the process of starting any small business, and in purchasing this book, had hoped for information on the things that I hadn't already thought of (or read elsewhere). In addition, I was concerned by the apparent lack of proofreading and editing. There were a number of ridiculous misprints, as well as inexplicable transitions within chapters. It seems like the author was more concerned about having written and published a book than putting out a quality product with new and progressive ideas. The purpose of a specialized book like this should be to DELVE deeply, while Ms. Chatman-Whitfield seems to give a cursory look at each chapter. If nothing else, I think the price should be lowered!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Info on Wedding Consulting","review":"This book may be great for those who just want basic small business information...but the book claims to tell people everything they need to know about being a wedding consultant--and it doesn't even come close to doing so.Instead of providing insider info, or even just great tips on being a wedding consultant and starting a consulting business, this book is mostly about basic business practices.In my opinion, this is an over-priced book, also, and I couldn't return quickly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree- Don't bother","review":"If you are looking for a book full of lists, then this is the book for you.

No controls or moving parts so this should last just about forever. Just adjust water flow/pressure to make the coverage area larger or smaller.To those reviewers who said it was too light to stay in place I have a simple solution. Take a wire coat hanger and cut the straight portion to about six inches in length; this can usually be done with a pair of pliers. 1\\" or 1 1/2\\" from one end use the pliers to bend the wire to a 90 degree angle making a handle of sorts. Use the \\"handle\\" to push the wire through the little hole (opposite of where the hose connects to the sprinkler) and down into the ground thereby stabilizing the sprinkler. When you're finished watering simply pull up on the \\"handle\\" removing the wire and you're sprinkler is ready to be used in another location. Hope this helps those who thought it was too light to stay on the ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Kid's CD!","review":"Although most of u might think that the That's So Raven soundtrack is for little kiddies aged 7-10, ur wrong.

She plays as a psychic teen, and can NOT sing. And the word Supernatural, means super-human. So by singing that song she is telling us that she is super-human. I just don't like Raven. I like several teen stars, including Hilary Duff. Mary-Kate and Ashley are OK, and I like Diana DeGarmo's music. She is about the same age as Diana, and has probably not had half as much practice as Diana. Diana is sooooooooooooooooo much better than Raven! I wonder how far Raven would make it American Idol. Probably not second place! I sure wouldn't vote for her. Raven wears waaaay to much makeup, unlike Hilary Duff. I don't know if I'll ever be a fan of Raven's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't quit your day job just yet Raven","review":"It scares me to think that anyone can get a record deal while more talented artists struggles to get even an A&R person to come to their show. Child star Raven Symone (who was hideously annoying on \\"The Cosby Show\\") is yet evidence that some people don't deserve a record contract. Her cover of Stevie Wonder's \\"Superstition\\" for that one Eddie Murphy movie she made last year was atrocious. Why remake a classic song and ruin it? Pop music continues to go further down the drain with people like Raven and William Hung."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"this album was terrible, it is just pop music that is only produced because the show is popular. Ever notice nowadays nearly every disney sitcom star acts and sings (and they're terrible singers!) For example that tall girl from that even steven show, raven symone, the sister sister twins or sisters or whatever they are. So if your interested in this album you're either A)don't have taste (in my opinion) or B)are just some adolencent kid that is addicted to the show or thinks ravens hott. My recomendation is to skip this piece of junk and go buy a offspring or sex pistols album, you'll be happier with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've Heard Better","review":"To me this is a terrible soundtrack. I think the beats or okay but the lyrics are so stupid they sound like Kidz Bop s***. There is only 2 halfway decent new songs on the album they are The theme song and Supernatural. The old songs are cool. But if you really want to hear some pop talent. PLEASE BUY RAVEN SYMONE'S ALBUM \\" THIS IS MY TIME\\". That Album is real pop. For the Producers of this album I would be like Donald Trump and say \\"YOUR FIRED\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair","review":"This soundtrack is fair. I loved Raven's voice though if I am the producer, I could request some of her songs to be re-arranged. Basically, I am a fan of the show but some of the songs are not related. Examples: Beautiful Soul and More To Life. We know they're great but songs should be related to the show that's why it's written on the cover: \\"Songs from or Inspired by the Hit TV Series\\". Nevertheless, it's still great... and you should grab a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE WORD: GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This cd is awesome! My favorite song by Raven is Supernatural! My favorite song on the whole cd is Beautiful Soul!!!!!!!!!!! This cd is awesome, and I own it.

Focusing more on abilities and not in capacities or mere base of knowledge, the PASS stands for Planning, Attention, Simultaneous and Successive processes. I use a lot this theory in conceptualizing my cognitive and neurocognitive cases. The PASS Remedial Pogram (PREP) who stand for PASS Reading Enhancement Program is very useful for children with reading disorders, training them to develop Succesive and Simultaneous strategies. A wonderful addition to the field.

We chose it because the hook direction could be changed so we could hang it on a towel rack. As the one we recived was made differently than the shower caddy in the picture,we could not do this. The only reason we kept it is because my husband took it apart and remade it to work for our needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust, rust, rust","review":"I purchased this caddy in May, 2012. The wires in the basket I use to hold shampoo bottles have already begun to rust, just barely two months after installing it in my shower.

When I bought this, it was rated 4 stars and seemed to have decent reviews. The shower caddy I received looks very similar, but the adjustable shelves are slightly different in how they hang. As a result, the shelves don't sit flat, they lean forward. This causes my shampoo bottles to lean forward and fall over.

It made me almost feel contempt for myself for being white!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Flow","review":"The Most striking feature according to me in this book is the way the transition that has been made from one character to another. You seem to be reading about someone like Kunte or George or Kissy for sometime and suddenly something happens and all of a sudden a new twist comes into the story. This is what really keeps the reader engrossed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roots","review":"Roots is an excellent book that I would recommend to people who are interested in African history. One of the main reasons I enjoyed this book was because it had a good story line and is was easy to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good generational saga!","review":"I reread ROOTS the first time in about twenty or twenty-five years. I thought the book perfect the first time I read it. I noted several flaws the second time, though. But no one had done a book like ROOTS before--it was truly revolutionary and started black and white people thinking about the barbarity of slavery and how difficult it was for black people to research their ancestors. Also, it taught how attitudes evolved over the generations. If Haley wrote the book today, it would be entirely a different work, so try to overlook the flaws. What Haley did was open people's eyes. Since reading ROOTS I have read many books on slavery and can recommend two recently published: The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones and The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the story, disappointed with editing","review":"The poor review is by no means a reflection of Roots, the book. The story deserved 5+++ stars - it was moving, captivating, enlightening, depressing, joyous, and worth every single one of the 888 pages it took Alex Haley to spin the story.However, I was shocked at the number of typos that dotted this edition of Roots. They were everywhere! I'm accustomed to a few throughout an entire book - certainly not a few per chapter, as I found in this edition.So, readers, know that, if you buy this edition of Roots, you're in for a truly marvelous story, one that I believe every American should read at least once in his or her lifetime...just also prepare yourself to grit your teeth at plentiful typos.Just a friendly warning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"This book is really eye-opening. I learned a lot about slavery in the US, and by extension, a lot about African cultures.The first half, about African abductee Kunte Kinte, is great. The second half, about Kunte's descendents, was less interesting to me. Throughout, the prose is about on par with Michener.All in all, a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of work!","review":"After watching the DVD release of Roots, I had to once again repurchase the book that made the movie version possible. Such vividly written material...it made you feel like you were actually there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, Humerous, and Moving","review":"This book was the best I have ever read, and I have read dozens and dozens of them. Some were good, but none brought on the same feelings as this particular novel. Alex Haley has told true, hard-core facts, but also adds a twist of his own story with humor and a style all his own. It begins in Kunta Kinte's small African village and the description of the very strict ways of his Mandinka tribe. It then progresses very quickly into the often horrifying story of the treatment of slaves when he is kidnapped and shipped to America. He has happy times there, but the bad ones far outnumber them. It is an amazing story of both personal and family strength, and I would reccomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humbled by this reading.","review":"I am WAY late in reading this book (2011). I wanted to read the complete story without having seen the movie adaptation because the inner thoughts of people can be as powerful as the visual protraying of them. This book is a TRUE masterpiece of time and dedication by Mr. Haley. I am horrified at what people can do to other people. No one who takes this literary journey would have to suffer the real impact of slavery and that is the power of this work -- unfortunately, it is all too true. I am humbled."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Roots\\" - Alot Of Excellant Reading","review":"This is one of the best books that I have ever read.

It has all the goodness of fiction, and all the weight of reality... You will know your way through the ancient African village, you'll respect their customs, appreciate their values. You will live a lifetime faraway from yours... Once you are done, you'll feel you know the family so well, you'd want to visit them and talk of ol' times...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Book","review":"Fascinating. The fact that the author was able to trace back seven generations of the Kinte family is highly impressive and has demostrated the amount of time and effort he put in, as well as the extent of his sincerity. The book has been written with such pride and love and is so brutally frank that I find it hard to put down and even harder to erase the images and emotions that the book has invoked in me. It has been a long time since I've been so deeply affected by a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy!","review":"I am half way through this book and even though it is over 600 pages it is an excellent read! Glad I purchased it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!!!","review":"Roots is probably the best novel I've ever read. It's a saga telling the story of the African-American experience from the time before America existed, to the present day (or close to it).A captivating novel.

I read all 700+ pages in about 5 days...The most important novel in America!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great novel marred by Haley's lie","review":"I soo wanted to give this book five stars, but the only thing holding me back was the knowlegde that the author fabricated and plagiarized most of the book. I so wish he hadn't of done that because this book is SUCH an important part of American literature. Had he just presented it as a work of fiction, it would have been just a powerful.As I began reading the book I started to doubt the reality of so much of it, which is a shame because on the whole I'm sure the novel is a very real account of slave life.If I think of it objectively however, the book stands tall as a work of fiction that should be required reading for all children. I just hope they are made to understand that it is not a true account.I wonder what went through Haley's mind as he wrote the last chapter which details his journey researching the novel knowing it wasn't true."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining but fiction nonetheless","review":"this was a long but entertaining book. mr haley took a handful of known facts and wove an interesting tale.my only problem is his not realizing the slavery in kunta,s village was just as wrong as that in america."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a mind capturing masterpiece!","review":"Last year, when I was only a few weeks into being 12 years old, I had to read this book out of needing to for school, and curiosity of what could be in a book so long. and I was simply amazed. This was and is clearly the best book I have ever read, no.. EXPERIENCED. I was really into this amazing book. I felt that I was actually in the book from the birth of Kunta Kinte to the journey to find the valuble information that was in the previous 400+ pages. I have absolutely no way to describe the greatness of this book, unless you read it for yourself and find out. This is little I could say - This is a simply amazing book from cover to cover.

What a trip into his past this was for Alex Haley. I was quite enjoyable to listen to the book at my leisure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Suprisingly Great Book!","review":"I'd recommend it to anyone! I will not get into a lot of detail, but it is a very emotional and action-packed saga of seven generations of a family.

Yes, some of these people worked closely with MJ, but the narrative format is a total bore.

The first half of the book is about how he and his wife look for a house, while the second half is mostly about food. Everything, of course, is absolutely perfect--the tuscan light, the tuscan hills, the tuscan food. This book is kind of an unintentional parody of the genre.It's also poorly written. Mate has almost no descriptive powers per se. He just tells us how sumptuous everything is. He also uses hyperbole so consistently that his observations become pointless. I thought a book like this would be interesting, but it's just self-indulgent and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard It All Before","review":"A disappointment. Almost everything in here has already been said in so many other books written about Tuscany.

Also, very brief entries; for example, when you look up a noun in the English-Slovak section, the dictionary provides a Slovak word but not the gender - one must then go to the Slovak-English section to see the noun's gender in Slovak. (perhaps this is obvious for a more advanced student). It is also a bit strange that in some cases the English-Slovak translation does not appear in reverse in the Slovak-English section.Unfortunately I haven't found a good dictionary at a good price for Slovak, as there are for other languages.

Other than this distracting detail, the movie is a decent western with an unexpected conclusion. I was also surprised at how good of a bad guy cowboy David Bowie turned out to be.

Beyond that, we also even like cheesy, B-grade movies, which are often at least good for a laugh. We sat down to watch this one with the expectation that it would either be good, and we'd like it, or it'd be bad, and we'd laugh at it. We were wrong. It was so bad we couldn't even finish it. We wanted to. We tried. It's so poorly written, badly dubbed, appallingly acted, haltingly paced, and generally dismal, that we couldn't plow through. I'm almost tempted to show it to friends as an example of one of the worst films I've ever seen, but it's really just not entertaining enough even as kitsch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please.","review":"Love David Bowie.

After dropping a buck and a half you'd think they'd be concerned about reviews and such, but I guess not. Their stance is that it has a two year warranty and that how it should be handled.The reason I have mixed feelings is that my mom has the mower with no issues, in fact she is the reason I purchased it, but I see a train wreck coming and things for me usually only get worse with defective product..............I THINK I GOT A LEMON.Thank god for Amazon as they are taking a return!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mower of the future","review":"Having been using it for a month so far, I have no complaints about this mower.

You can say I was like a Greek sailor and the Robomower was the Sirens. Anyone who knows Greek mythology knows that the Sirens lead Greek ships into the rocks and sent the sailors to their death. Tis the story with the Robomower.For the high price of this mower I expected it to last more than 3 years without a major repair. My blade motor went out just after three summers of use. Since I live in Michigan my mowing season is quite short. Of course the mower is out of warranty. The cost of shipping for the repair and the repair itself is not a cost effective choice. I could purchase a low-end gas mower for the same amount.Seems to me the technology has a little ways to go yet. I wish you luck if you choose to purchase the Robomower.

I applaud Stasheff's restraint in not forcing the relationship between Magnus and his companion, Alea, into an overly predictable direction. Each character remains true to his and her strengths and weaknesses. The story, which involves Magnus' continuing mission to help oppressed peoples find the government best suited to them, gives Magnus a world where there appears to be no visible government, or rather, not one he can classify. Like the other books in this series, the story is self contained, and makes you want to learn more about Magnus.

To the woman barely dangling at the end of her rope, Debi throws out a lifeline of solid Biblical insights and practical solutions for simplifying life's maze, while amplifying its meaning. This book is filled with help, hope, and humor, all borne from Debi's personal challenges and successes. Because of her willingness to change with God's help, Debi progressed from living maxed-out, to living to the max-from experiencing the fracture of many things to enjoying the fulfillment of \\"one thing\\" and the One Who really matters.

I found so many surprising things in the book. The author's research on Martha of Bethany was really eye opening. I hadn't considered how they may have met Jesus or that they may have been wealthy. And she answers the question...\\"Why is Martha so bent out of shape?\\" The stories from the author's life, and those of friends, made people stop and ask me why I was laughing so hard. My two favs, the young couple preparing for the family BBQ and Milly's cats \\"swaggering through the food encrusted dishes, like tiny Cleopatras walking through piles of gold.\\" I must have read that part to 10 people and I cried with laugher ever time!

And Debi doesn't just leave you tied up in knots; she loosens you up with plenty of seasoned advise that strikes at the heart of the problem--to correct the faulty thinking patterns that max women out in the first place.

There is a reasonably good story, but the writing is second rate. The are many technical errors. There are a multitude of needless and mind-numbing destriptions of minutia that do nothing to advance the story. This train wreak of a book is further worsened by the author's parroting of the far right's view of the world and his mindless jingoism. If that wasn't enough, 90% of the book reels along like a drunken sailor, only to have what should have been 50% of the book jammed into the last 10% of the book.Save yourself some time and don't read this piece of tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written For Robinson","review":"This book has a very good idea from the conceptual standpoint. The trouble is the good part of the book is only 50 pages long. I kept trying to figure out how the author was going to cram all that was needed into the few pages remaining and of course he couldn't. Why he spent the first 300 plus pages developing a character is beyond me. He could have done it in the first fifty pages and left the rest for good stuff. If you enjoy Kilo Class and USS Seawolf you will not enjoy this one. If you must read it wait for the paperback or go to the library.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author's agenda gets in the way of the story","review":"Having read a couple of previous efforts by Patrick Robinson (Kilo Class and HMS Unseen), I thought perhaps I'd stumbled across a half-decent new author. Those books weren't wonderful, but they were decent bathroom reads. Unfortunately this book is nearly unreadable. Robinson's political diatribes become extremely tiresome, and he spends long stretches on pointless dialogue and descriptions. At one point he takes a full page describing a Navy staffer's commute to the Pentagon for a crisis management meeting. The story frequently bogs down with these needless interludes.There are massive plot holes, and plot points that are so unbelievable as to be laughable. The prison escape, the Chinese plot to hide the submarine in the Panama canal rather than scuttling it in deep water, and the US Navy's impotence in the face of attack are a few examples.I gave it two stars rather than one because the plot was interesting. But it could have been so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"jump the shark","review":"Robinson has been a very good writer. I have listened to a lot of his other work. (Btw, Guidall does a killer Morgan, everyone should hear it once)However, I agree w/ other reviewers' comments fully about this book's shortcomings: Clinton, politics, hard-to-believe political plotlines, etc. I was especially disappointed by the rehashing of the oil-futures-doom plotline that was very similar to the oil-futures-doom plotline in the \\"Shark Mutiny\\".I hope Robinson is also disappointed by this work and brings us,in his usual style, a winner next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful, pitiful, pitiful","review":"Plot a little far-fetched, but I can suspend reality for the sake of entertainment if necessary. Problem was, there's little entertainment. Enough right-wing cliches about Clinton to make a Bush supporter vote for Howard Dean. And the ending, well, there is no ending. They might was well as had on order form at the end of the book to pre-order the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice plot, horrible writing","review":"What do you say when an author takes a good plot and mangles the execution?First, the research is falty. The author has no idea how the US would react to this type of threat. Has he nbever heard of AWACS?Second, the author seems to think more words are better. A little background is nice during a story, but why pad everything?Third, a black and white view of politicians is both childish and self-defeating. The author made the characters seem clueless in his voice over political tirades.Fourth, misplaced jargon makes the story ludicrous in places. How many English/Iranians use California pop expressions?Fifth, the dialog in general is pittiful. Words and phrases chosen for educated characters are weak, trite, and Bush league. (Sorry, could not resist.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Attrocious","review":"Patrick Robinson makes the Israelis look like monsters, the Americans look like fools, and the Hammas terrorists and Arabs who call themselves palestians look like romantics."},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have been call \\"Taking back the canal\\"","review":"The story line was all over the place. Maybe, just so he can cover the whole gamut of genre. It was intriguing in that you wonder where the author is taking you. But alas to the disappointing ending. Thats the reason for the 2 star and I'm being very generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"wretched","review":"Here, let me save you a few excruciating hours: Evil Islamiac terrorists buy a nuclear submarine and secretly sneak across the ocean to blow stuff up. However, a good solid American right-wing administration, led by hard-talking, cliche-speaking laughable caricature Arnold Morgan chase them down- almost. This book not only has no style and a contrived plot at best, the endless preponderance of simple-minded, sheerly idiotic right-wing rants and slights to democrats, greens, and anybody else who'se not a jackbooted thug wearing american-flag underwear will truly, as one reviewer says, turn a Bush supporter iinto a Dean fan. Please, for the love of humanity, save your money and don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"could happen","review":"Story starts out a little non realistic but the more you read the more you start to understand that this could happen to us. The thing is this is an older pub date and now 8 years later your eyes really open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"So, Robinson spends almost the entire first third of this book following the bad guy around from birth, who is admittedly an interesting character, and then mostly discards this character for the rest of the book. Did I mention that there really is no \\"hero\\"? Nope, once the bad guy melts into the background, the rest of this ponderous tome \\"focuses\\" on how sneaky submarines are, a preposterous pseudo-Academy Awards sequence, and the evils of Bill Clinton. The ending? Something big is blown up and there are absolutely no repercussions. What started out for me as an intersting delve into a genre of fiction I had little previous experience with turned into a surreal, delusional political rant I have no interest in returning to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure dribble","review":"I would agree with most of the reviews on here and would say that I was a Patrick Robinson fan until now. He should have re-named the book Clinton- the disaster. His plot also has one major flaw, as well as all the others that have been mentioned. How would attacking the Alaskan oil supply make the US MORE likely to become isolationist, as HAMAS and Iraq desire? It makes no sense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally ran out of ideas","review":"Patrick Robinson started his series in the submarine genre with a splash with thrillers such as Nimitz Class and HMS Unseen, truly enjoyable reads. This era of the series died painfully in Barracuda 945.Mr. Robinson has foregone adventure for preachiness. His focus is now on the badness of Democratic presidents. This could be overlooked if he made the point and moved on. Instead, he comes back time and again to reiterate his same words (I hesitate to call them ideas) to exhaustion. He uses the narrator and multiple characters to say the same thing repeatedly, removing any interest the reader has in the story.The door is left open for a sequel, but unless I read a review to indicate Mr. Robinson has returned to his roots and left the preaching to televangelists, I will miss my first Patrick Robinson book if and when it is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good effort by Robinson","review":"This book should be called Barracuda 945 Part 1. Robinson uses this book as a platform for expressing his opinions on the Clinton Administration, Hollywood and the Oil Industry while straying from his roots as a sub warfare fiction writer. There is NO sub tactical warefare in this book and the author shows the U.S. ineptness at dealing with an enemy nuclear sub. Don't expect an ending because the author chose not to bring to a conclusion any of the story's major threads, which leaves this reader unsatisfied. I thought Robinson would learn his lesson from Hollywood that sequals are not better than the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Read","review":"I am (was) quite a fan of Robinson, although I have been progressively dissapointed lately with each new novel. I tried to read this with an open and enthusiastic mind. Well, the beginning was okay. But one quarter of the way through I was battling terribly, I finished it out of duty. The days of Nimitz Class and Kilo Class are clearly gone, and are not coming back. The story is absurd. It moves at a painfully slow pace. The characters are undeveloped and dull. This book paints an idiotic view of the US administration. Okay, perhaps it is on the mark there presently, but Arnold Morgan is even more ridulous than anything I can imagine even in the current US administration, and there is a lot of latitude there already! The general flow of the story is all too predictable, and I cannot recommend it. If you've never read Robinson before, rather read Nimitz Class or Kilo Class. If you have, then don't touch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"selling out","review":"Patrick Robinson suffers from Tom Clancy Disease with Barracuda 945-not much of an idea,page after page of nothing happening,desperately in need of an editor to lop off the extra pages added to justify the outrageous price of the book and he even goes Clancy one better,the entire book was nothing more than a set up for a sequel.Patrick,what's with the excruciating geographical references,the making of the Admiral Morgan character into a cartoon,your repeated refences to the Clinton administration(hey,we didn't like him either but we don't want to read about him in your books)? I've absolutely enjoyed every one of your books but you should be ashamed if you cash any royalty checks for this rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too implausible, too opinionated","review":"I like P Robinson's other books but this one is both a stretch as well as a platform for childish name calling. Obviously, he hates democrats but this is supposed to be a novel not a billboard. I have yet to see a good military author resort to terms like \\"conservation minded tree-hugger\\" or \\"whining democratic congressmen\\". I'm ex-Navy and enjoy good military fiction but Robinson can peddle his war mongering jingoism elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just political posturing","review":"I am so sick of the political undercurrents in Patrick Robinson's books that I have stopped reading them. Though the stories are good, Robinson diminishes them by labeling and pigeonholing and demeaning anybody he does not agree with politically - especially Democrats. I stopped reading Scimiter SL-2 because I got so sick of it. I'm sure HarperCollins would sell more books if they could get him to stop the bashing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been a good book . . .","review":"... but there's WAY, WAY too much political preaching. First I must state that after spending almost 13 years in the military, there's nothing more that I like than a good military techno-thriller. Patrick Robinson's novels were high on my list of such authors --- until this one.Arnold Morgan was a strong believable character in Robinson's first two novels, but becomes crazed, growling and too unbelievable in this one. If Robinson would just leave his political rants out of his books, I would've rated this one much higher -- but I just got turned off by the many unavoidable preaching and degrating comments and references about our past (and present) U.S. leaders and policy makers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed Book!","review":"The central character in this book is Ravi Rashood(Ray Kerman).He is a British SAS Major.His mother and Father and Ray move to England after the Shah is deposed and Iran becomes a Muslim stateHis father becomes wealthy in the shipping business.Ray Kermanjoins the SAS becoming an excellent officer and rising throughthe ranks.On a training mission in Palestine with the Israelishe witnesses untold violence and brutality toward the Palenstenian citizens and is forced to kill two fellow SAS soldiers.He thewn joins forces with Hamas.He is promoted to therank of General.He robs two banks in Israel making off with 100million dollars.He next breaks into the Nimrod prison and releases 47 Palestenian terrorists.After these two escapades he next coaxes the Iranian governmentto purchase two nuclear submarines from Russia through China.Withthese two submarines he wreaks havoc on the United States.This was a very exciting book. The author ended with room for a sequel.Read it.You will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I very much so agree...","review":"Most people who have written other 1 star reviews have pretty much summarized this books short-comings pretty well. The only thing I would add is that the author obviously hates former President Clinton and sticks us with the tab for his OPINIONS. You can't go twenty pages without some jab at the former President. Also, Mr. Robinson seems to spend most of his time trying to make sure the reader enjoys and understands the scenery rather the technology a good submarine thriller is based upon. If I wanted a travel guide, I would have bought that instead. I agree with another reviewer that Dimercurio is the way to go in this genre...This is a poor effort from a talented author that has written many wonderful books...I'll buy the next one but wait for it to go to paperback!!PS= Get ride on the 1.2.3.4.5. lists that we see about four times in this book......it's annoying and childish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, silly ending","review":"I've read a number of Robinson's books and was pleased to begin this one. Terrorists buys two Russian submarines and sends one as a visible decoy to China while the other one creates mayhem in the U.S.My main problem with the book, other than the silly ending obviously written in after the editors wanted an upbeat finale, is that most of the book is based on hiding the existence of the marauding submarine and then having it surface on purpose so it can be caught in shallow waters. Total lunacy.On the other hand the first two thirds is a good read. Perhaps some shadow author can rewrite the last third and fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally moronic.","review":"If your idea of a good military read is to try to follow a writer who can't tell east from west, is unable to develop intelligent characterization or even a believable plot, and who constantly bashes anything or anybody even slightly to the left the most conservative brain-dead republican you have ever met - then this book is for you. Two thirds of the way through it I literally tore the book apart before trashing it. I simply couldn't bear the thought of someone finding it and reading the ramblings of this intellectually deficient, self-righteous fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hopeful start of a better follow up?","review":"Having read all Patrick Robinson's previous \\"submarine-work\\" I must say that Barracuda 945 was a bit of a dissapointment to me. The errors in the book concerning the typing were a bit disturbing. The most disturbing however was Patrick Robinson's urge to give his opnion on Hollywood and former politicians and their politics in this book. Some of the comment on these former politicians was functional, yet I found there was too much of comment.The only thing I can hope for is that Barracuda 945 is a kind of an upstep to a follow up that will be just as good as Nimitz Class, HMS Unseen, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as previous efforts","review":"I really enjoyed Robinson's previous novels. However, this one leaves much to be desired. The protagonist, an SAS officer, undergoes an epiphany that is quite a stretch to accept. After this he becomes a dedicated and dangerous terrorist. The action then plods along in a rather formulaic manner - interspersed by polemics against Democrats and former President Clinton. Please, Mr. Robinson, you have more talent than you've brought to this effort!Potential readers: skip this one & read his previous novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential Primer on Pitching Health","review":"Mr. Carroll does a marvelous job assembling and disseminating the evolving body of knowledge on this topic in a manner which is accessible and engaging. Contrary to the statements made by another recent reviewer, Mr. Carroll _does_ have a background in sports medicine. He relies up on this, but never loses sight of his audience.This book is invaluable reading for both experts and neophytes alike. Few areas are more misunderstood than the health and training of pitchers, and knowledge of and adherence to the principles espoused by Carroll and his subjects would go a long way toward improving pitchers' health and the overall quality of baseball.If you love baseball, read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Be Dangerous","review":"A book like this could be dangerous for inexperienced pitchers.

Her stories are well told, and the perspective from which she tells them is shared by every mother.

I was forced to read it for a AP US History class. If you can stay awake to read it, it details everything you need to know about how the U.S. government has swindled and cheated Native Americans in this country. It was written in the late 1800's and we just don't talk like that anymore as a country. Like my teacher said: \\"The reason this book was so powerful was because it listed every incident with many tribes to bring home this point: There needs to be a change how they handled the Native Americans.\\" No one in the class read the book cover to cover, including myself.

This table was the perfect solution. Our son can enjoy it without his sisters destroying it. I do think its a draw back that you can not change the track into different patterns like with traditional tables, but if you have a situation like us I defienately recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this table","review":"I think this table is great. My son 2 1/2 adores it, and it not a mess to clean of small parts.So why did I only give it 4 stars? I expected the top to be made of plastic as well, unfortunatly it is made of particle board with a laminated top. All it takes is a few spill and the top is destroyed. I have moved the top to storage and will not be using it for an art station. I am also a little disappointed that the legs are only held together each with a single screw.But other than those complaints.... I LOVE THE TABLE, and would definately recommend to any car or train crasy kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"I absolutely LOVE thist train table - its perfect for my 18 month old - tracks are molded down so he can play with it w/out messing the tracks up - Great Product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for my 3yr old","review":"Not a bad deal, great overall table.Lots of room for his cars and trains.Installing was not too bad... some decals were to big."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Birthday Gift for a Toddler","review":"I purchased this train table for my 2 year old son and he hasn't stopped playing with it since we set it up.Setup: Took some time to get the stickers on the table. The bridges attach with locking plastic push pins, just had one that was a little difficult.Usability: This table accommodates multiple children playing at the same time. I love the table top that goes over the play area. Makes the table usable for art projects or running cars and trains on top. The table sits at a great height for toddlers on the move.Quality: The table and the stickers seem to be of very high quality, the cars and trains that come with the table should just be thrown away.Final Review: I would recommend this table to any parent that has toddlers with interests in vehicles. It has quickly become my sons go to toy. Just buy some other cars and trains for the table, due to the low quality of the ones included with the table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for the little ones that love trains","review":"I bought this toy for my two year old nephew.

Started to put it together, when I noticed that in one area, there had to have been air pockets while the company was injecting the plastic into the mould. There were many small holes all the way through and with just one touch the plastic would break through to the next hole. There was also a track that would not lay flush due to it being too large for the span. It was at the bottom of a hill where the car would pick up speed and then come to a sudden stop not being able to go over the track. Amazon was terrific in the return process and (hopefully I won't be sorry) sending out of a replacement. I am hoping this bad one was just a fluke and the replacement table will be fine.

After having read the book i can only give you the advice not to read this book if you want hints and tricks to improve on your reading skills. This book was born in 1940 - and it shows. They tell you to read the new testament! However, the release dat can also be positive. It's a rich, logical and very formal language. You won't find so much perfection in a book nowadays.The authors EXPALAIN HOW A BOOK IS STRUCTURED AND HOW IT WAS WRITTEN, but they don't give you much hints, which would help you. They just say: Read carefully, read slowly, compare the books to other books. But hey, don't YOU know that? They explain WHAT DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOOKS EXIST - but: who cares! I want to know \\"how to read a book\\" and nothing else!I read the book completly, but it was not an enjoyment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, stay away.","review":"This book is made to show people how to dive into the higher levels of reading, specifically it aims at collegiate reading. However, there is a huge paradox tied up with this book. If you don't know how to read at a higher level, you won't get anything out of this book because you won't be able to connect with a lot of the information presented. If you do read well (and by this, i mean are not a complete moron) then this book is a huge waste of time and you will really learn nothing. The best thing I learned from this book offered another paradox. It says to learn to recognize books that are not worth your time and effort and do not give them that effort.

I really wish I would've been able to read this book before I went to university.Even the advice on reading novels for entertainment, while probably common sense to many, is useful. In addition, there is a (rather intimidating) reading list at the end.So, overall, a must-read.

It is a thoughtful and eloquent book, but, in my opinion, practical advice found in it could fit on a couple of small pages, and should not be new. (In essence, the advice is: \\"It makes sense to read a book in more than one pass, scanning/skimming at first\\", and \\"Do not read passively, but think about what you read, engage with the author's ideas\\"). Speaking of enjoyment, one may like the old-fashioned writing style, but surely can find it elsewhere for free - you might as well read, say, Hume or Darwin.

Those who know what they should do, but are naturally lazy.. As noted in the book(pg.338-339), some books do deserve the effort of all the suggestions Adler and Van Doren make while others can be spared the extensive analysis.

I researched a lot and these stands claimed they could hold up to 8 lbs. The speakers that came with my system are around 6 lbs. The stands barely stay upright. And there's no way to extend the hight because the locking mechanism is too weak to hold up the speakers. These might be a great choice for really little light speakers but not for anything more than 4 lbs. (my guess)."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Limited in Adaption","review":"First of all, the photo of these speaker stands is very unrepresentative of the stands delivered. For example, take a look at the wire speaker supports at the top of the stands. They look like they are tall, and like they are highly adaptable for a variety of speakers (I even went to the manufacturers web site to TRY to get a better look at them). Unfortunately, they are only about five inches tall and can only be adjusted in-out about ONE inch. That's not a lot of room for adjustment. Too bad. If they had included two or three more of the wire speaker supports to accommodate different sizes of speakers, this product would be a four or five star rating. Just a shame. I am going to return these and try the Sanus Systems EF-SATB stands instead. Good Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating in the extreme.","review":"I don't know enough about the Elizabethan time to know what this book may have left out, but I found it utterly fascinating.People today seem so proud of their own scientific views and look down on older ones as so obviously out of date, but they fail to recognize that given what the people of the time had access to, their worldview was just as consistent with the then known facts as 'ours' is today.Some day the prevalent worldview may become blatantly wrong according to new facts, and maybe some day people will read about it and be as fascinated by 'our'worldview as I am by the Elizabethan.This book does a wonderful job of describing the fantastically interconnected parts that make up the Elizabethan worldview, and I find it something worth using to understand and read things written at the time and to remember as metaphor for today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Window to a Different World","review":"This book is a great introduction to the mystical thought of Ash-Sheikh Aj-Jilani. Anyone who has any interest in finding the true, simple meaning of life, or seeks self purification should start with this book. Keep in mind, if you haven't read about mysticism/sufism before, you need to keep an open mind as to his wording and his actions. He does mention things in a way that the average person would deem, arrogant or self centered, but this man was beyond anything even closely related to that.

Once the cottony tip on the match head burns away there is nothing really to hold the fluid and thus becomes difficult to light. The more time you spend striking, the less likely it will flame. It is also really small and a pain to strike without getting fluid on your fingers.

As far as I can tell by the published specs. the JBL SUB 10 is its replacement. The grill is different. My E150P is well engineered and is very pleasing to listen to.In my listening room ( 16'x12' with vaulted ceiling ) which is not set up for surround sound, the E150p really brings out a symphonic bass drum or a 32Hz organ pedal. For under $200 I believe you will be satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good sub-woofer by JBL.","review":"I had this sub-woofer, and it is the best 10\\" around. It is great.

It's kinda sorta OK for movies if you're in a small room and put it in a corner but for bigger rooms and music listening it's just a cryin' joke. I keep having to get up and adjust the gain knob, there's an excruciatingly narrow \\"sweet spot\\" above which you get buzzing and booming, and below which the darn thing is pretty much inaudible...and this elusive \\"sweet spot\\" changes from one type of music to another! Maddening.What I wish I knew then that I know now: in the under three hundred dollar range you're best off going with the 10\\" Dayton subwoofer from partsexpress dot com, or save up for a 400-600 sub from Internet-direct subwoofer specialists Hsu and SVS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for HT...not so good for music...It's all about the source...","review":"This sub does a good job for Home Theater in a small to medium sized room but for music it just doesn't go low enough. Would work better in a bedroom or a dorm. You'll only hear the difference if you're source is via digital coax or fiber optic cable. It does a decent job however for movies in Dolby D.Bottom line, if you want a good sub for both music and movies in a medium to large sized room. You need at least a 12\\" 250 watt or better sub. I would recommend the JBL E250P instead if you really want deep bass to fill the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment!","review":"The DVD has nothing to do with a slumber party.

This CD is a travesty in the truest sense of the word. This is advertised as greatest hits of Webber's music, but there is nothing of the original feeling of Webber's music on this CD. Though they may have talent for other music, the makers of this CD totally miss the mark in translating Webber's music. Selection #4 is a particular mockery with its techno-translation of the piece. There are many other options available with quality recordings of Webber's music. Do not buy this CD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice blanket, almost brown","review":"Blanket is very nice.

I thought that was all there were. Imagine my surprise and delight at discovering there are 33 total! I've done some research, and have found out that Jerry West was a pen name only. Most of the books were written by the same person, a couple of them were not. The books came from the same publisher as Nancy Drew, Hardy Boys, and other children's series books. Quite a bit of information about the Happy Hollisters is available on the internet, including a full list of all H.H. books published. I'm determined to have the whole collection eventually!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MYSTERY, TRAVEL, AND FUN","review":"If only the kids today had a book series like the Happy Hollisters.

She enjoyed it just as much as I used to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe for Kids","review":"This is more than \\"memory lane\\" but a series that has children learning right from wrong and to accept responsibility for their actions not to mention learning from mistakes. You will even find them doing things they are responsible for before continuing their sleuthing (prioritizing). The stories end in the '60's, not '50's (yet, they are timeless). The titles are \\"safe\\" to give children / grandchildren unlike some so called modern children's titles out there that have crass content, at best, but are not previewed by parents / grandparents. The Happy Hollister's series are stories that contain good character examples with children learning to work for things and not just expect things without personal and honest effort. They also exhibit self sacrifice for the benefit of others. I am glad that the titles are being reprinted without editing to include Kindle versions by the late author's family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful family who solves mysteries","review":"I read The Happy Hollisters when I was growing up.

Mine had problem the second week, and when I called the tech. the only way he would look at it is for me to ship it to them. That is 80 to 100 dollars in shipment, and he didn't know how long it will take.

I may design and build a home for him, to simplify the winter storage process, but I can't wait until spring so I can truly turn him loose and see how well he performs in real life.The docs are accurate, though a bit sparse, so far.

Well that is what you have here with the Robomower. Of course the cost to ship and fix the mower is quite expensive. When I purchased this product the Friendly Robotics went on and on about how good it was. Well let me tell you that this is not the case. The product is not even close to worth what it costs. I am going to stick with conventional gas mowers from now on. We all need to protect ourselves from products that are costly with short warranty periods."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best.","review":"This book has a way of describing the ways of the language that no other book has. Although I have used other books like Wheelock and Oxford Latin, I find that this book is the best for the beggining Latin student because of its simple, yet extremely effective way of teaching the reader word endings with comparisons to other words at the same time.This books increased my Latin vocabulary considerably, because it uses not only classical Latin vocabulary, but ecclesiastical and medieval vocabulary as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners???","review":"This book is not for any \\"beginners\\". It is my best guess that this book is not a starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Eclesiastical Latin! Not Classical!","review":"Needing a review of the latin I learned in College, I purchased this slim volume ot do some revision. It claims to be both Classical and Medieval, but I could not really find much classical latin inside except some scant quotes that they throw at you which you can't read even after you complete this book!! There seems to be some religious bias here, too. The readings are about some monks somewhere in Europe, and most of the dialogue makes fun of the classical \`pagans\`.Then, using it solely as a grammer review, I quickly noticed there were almost no examples of the grammer.Don't waste your money on this book. Learn it properly. Anyone who wants a fun introduction to latin I suggest Cambridge Latin Course or Oxford's Latin; far and above this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, easy, and concise book","review":"I am a law student. Prior to law school I went through Wheelock's Latin to aquire a basis for the language. Wheelock's is an excellent introduction to the language which I recommend going through before purchasing this book. The beauty of the Teach Yourself book is that it is so engaging, fun, and concise. It is an excellent supplement to Wheelock's because it cements together everything you have already covered and provides a worktape by which you can check your pronunciation. It would be difficult to come away from this book and not have a very solid basis for the language.There is another review here whereby a person claims to have mastered Latin through this course and Wheelock's to such an extent that it got him into Oxford. Having gone through both these texts myself, I have no doubt that this is true. I cannot overemphasize the quality of this course and the extent to which it brought the language alive for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book of The Courtier - amendments for earlier reviews","review":"my dear nessie monster,i think people would take your review more seriously if you managed to keep it in the right century! 15th!!!The main debate was whether to use old tuscan Italian or the new contemporary Italian of which Castiglione finally decided upon. It was this use of contemporary language which made it so popular, and therefore went on to numerous translations. Castiglione was the 'Mick Jagger' of his day, assisted by his decision to appeal to mass readership.

It was a total waste of money, and Amazon should be ashamed to carry it!Buy a more reputable version, one with headings and sections.This was so hard to read that it made no sense, and took twice as long to read.This is a poor translation, and does not do justice to the text content or Castiglione's great work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading on this subject","review":"Ross Gelbspan provides an invaluable addition to the literature on a global problem. He details the way in which the oil and coal industries, both of whom have an enormous financial stake in the status quo, energy-wise, have poured money into a propaganda campaign designed to prevent action on global warming. They have done so by creating the illusion that there is a genuine debate by scientists as to whether global warming is taking place. Probably the most valuable part of the book is the appendix in which Gelbspan reproduces statements from leading climate scientists demolishing some of the most common arguments of the so-called \\"greenhouse skeptics\\" Patrick Michaels, Robert Balling and S. Fred Singer, three key figures in the corporate propaganda campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gelbspan offers insight into science & politics of warming","review":"Having just read The Heat Is On and interviewed both Ross Gelbspan and Robert Balling for EV World, I came away with an appreciation of both the complexity of the issue, but also the politics underlying it. While Gelbspan admits he's no climatologist, he's interviewed numerous professionals in the field, and read the works of the leading skeptics, including Balling who would have you believe that this is a non-issue and even if it were an issue, we can't do anything about it. Ross not only thinks we can do something about it, but he's also spent the last year working with others to develop a plan to begin the gradual transition away from fossil fuels to sustainable technologies, one which won't jeopardize the global economy or the environment.

It is one of the most clear and concise catalogues and comparisons of meditation techniques from throughout the ages I've ever come across. It also, near the end, describes parts of the Abbidhama and Vissudumagga and illustrates the differing approach of psychology, a very old science in the East, to our relatively very new science of psychology in the West. Very informative, very clear, as concise as one could make these concepts, and for ANY meditators, I would expect it to be an enlightening look at your current practice. I highly recommend this book. (I'll also highly recommend Social Intelligence, another great Dan Goleman.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Emtotional Intelligence!","review":"It seems this was written before Goleman's signature book, \\"Emotional Intelligence\\".

It was these guys, these films and the riders around them who invented 'extreme' and helped paved the way to the fat skis, massive drops and tricks we're inundated with today.This collection is from the latter part of his filmography.

There are great diagrams and the steps are numbered 1,2,3 etc. But there are such big gaps in their explanations.

The plot unfolds as a disturbing and peculiarly Gallic version of the Pygmalion story, with Bernard Giraudeau and Jean-Pierre Lorit giving masterful performances as a rich businessman and ne'er-do-well waiter entwined in an increasingly perverse and strange relationship, though it is never clear whether the employer's attraction for his handsome employee is motivated by sexual desire or some darker attraction. It is to this film's credit that it achieves its unsettling effect on the viewer without resorting to graphic sex or violence, and no slander to say that memories of Hitchcock are evoked during its course, particularly \\"Rope\\" and \\"Strangers on a Train.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent","review":"Intelligent dialogues.

It's a shame this song wasn't culled for the TV soundtrack, but I am proud to have it on my CD player.I really tried to like the radio cuts, but am disappointed they were so darn overmarketed.

He explained in his program note that it was an immense effort to attempt the work, considering his age and near blindness (macular degeneration had blocked out the keyboard except for the extreme upper and lower notes). He should have been talked out of making such an effort. This cautious, often slow reading may get the notes in, but at too high a cost. Mehta tiptoes and tries to cushion the most difficult parts, to no avail. In addition, the Israel Phil. sounds mediocre, especially in the string body, and one only has to hear the opening orchestral part to be discouraged: Mehta vacillates between slackness and aggressive punches.

Moore admits early on that he has co-opted only the title from the classic work by John of the Cross. Moore's book is about spiritual and emotional crisis. In the original by John of the Cross, the Dark Night is not about crisis, it is about deeper union with God... the \\"dark night\\" is a metaphor for the place where lovers meet. Moore's book is okay if you are looking for a self-help pop psychology book. But if you were looking for a book about deepening spirituality, you should read Gerald May's book of the same title instead.

Most of the tracks are far sparser than the normal Stax sound, and there's rather more piano than you normally find on released Stax tracks. There are two stand out tracks; \\"Will you still love me tomorrow\\" owes little to the Shirelles version, and \\"She wont be like you\\" would be a surefire hit for any current soul giant who cared to re-record it!

There are no added fake sugars like sorbitol (found in my favorite gum, Trident) which is good in the sense of health (probably), yet the sweetness runs out way too quickly (like the real juicy fruit). I'm averaging around 10 minutes of sweetness per two rectangles. Weak. Otherwise, it is a solid gum, it's good for your teeth (per my dentist) due to the high amount of xylitol. Xlear just needs to figure out how to make the sweetness last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"summary: think flavor-less gum + xylitol mouth wash coating","review":"2 stars because it actually delivers xylitol to my mouthhowever, as far as i can tell, all of the xylitol is found in the hard coating, not in the gum itself. therefore, unless you avoid chewing the gum, virtually all of the xylitol goes into salival suspension within a couple minutes, and you either have to swish a mouthful of spit around in order to expose your mouth biota to the xylitol for an extended period, or continually add new pieces of gum.-3 stars because the xylitol is only present in a significant amount as long as i dont swallow. the economics of buying pure bulk xylitol are probably better. the xylitol shouldve been infused into the gum.no word on if it helps slow or halt tooth decay, if anyone knows a strong strategy on remineralizing teeth (other than a better diet, im broke) please let me know in the comments, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Worst Flavor","review":"I use Spry xylitol gum regularly for a variety of reasons.

So, I was excited to see fruit flavor available. However, I was very disappointed when we received it and it was artificially flavored. Not a big deal to most people, but it is to us. The only reason I ordered it was because I thought it was all natural. My kids did try it before we realized it, and they liked the flavor, but I ended up throwing most of it away.

Once calibrated, however, all shots seem to register fine while playing. A fun game that even holds up against my favorite PS2 games. But as with Point Blank 2, I hate the game-style selection menus.

The authors have truly done their research (and I'm sure had a great time doing it). Their use of mathematical analogies to explain the complex interactions involved in human behavior is both funny and interesting. I actually laughed out loud while reading this thought-provoking analysis of dating behavior.

Only the most fervent devotees of the somewhat trendy Trappist would find this book ineluctable; the rest of us can profit by avoiding it. We look to his earlier work for nourishment: Thoughts in Solitude (1958), New Seeds of Contemplation (1961), and many of his poems and journals. THE SPRINGS OF CONTEMPLATION strikes this reader as needless chit-chat about silence. We do not find God in the book, but a tired talkative Merton who is a bit too convinced of his own sagacity.

I've had a little trouble with the software: I can't get the OCR scanning feature to work. But I think a real scanner is better for this job anyway.

Raymond Burr actually does a decent job as Barney Chavez, a plantation manager who decides he wants the wife of the plantation owner for himself. In fact the acting is fairly decent all the way around (especially for this era and genre) but the plot bogs down in a very slow romance subplot for the majority of the middle thirty minutes of the film.In essence Barney commits murder with a giant poisonous snake, and is subsequently cursed by a witch for his unsavory behavior. The practical upshot of this is that we get to see Raymond Burr transmogrify into a gorilla, though it is mostly seen in reflection shots (mirrors, lakes, etc.) Ultimately everyone gets their just rewards, and after what seems like 66 very long minutes, you can try to forget you wasted an hour of your life on this bore.Bottom line: it really isn't that bad, it's just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which DVD","review":"There are two DVD releases of BRIDE OF THE GORILLA - is there any difference in print quality between them???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Six tracks omitted - not recommended","review":"At 38 min. long, this is an emasculated release of the original LP.

His insight and passion, and vast historical knowledge, into finding out the facts behind the legend of King Arthur make \\"The Discovery of King Arthur\\" a powerful read indeed. Ashe unravels the tangled myths to reveal the facts behind the legend, and pinpoints Arthur to one individual who, more than any other man, fits the description of \\"Arthur\\". Ashe makes a very provocative, and eloquent, case for his existance; and bases his argument on facts, rather than hearsay, or personal opinion. We may never know whether or not King Arthur actually existed; however, Ashe treats us to a well written and fascinating look into myth and reality, as well as giving us a history lesson we cannot possibly fall asleep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible Reading for Arthurian Enthusiasts","review":"This book represents the culmination of a lifetime of research by a leading scholar. Geoffrey Ashe should be commended for the great advances he has made in uncovering the history underlying the legend of King Arthur.

In The Open Society and It's Enemies he presents not only the case for democracy (an open society) but also the case against tyranny (a closed society), no matter how benevolent any given tyranny purports to be. Popper also explains why many people are still attracted to tyranical forms of government -- whether fascist or communist. Such people prefer order to freedom.

A Chicago native and former chemist(hence the title of this album), Psalm One has actually been in the game( as a best kept secret) for about 7 years now. This is one of the few albums where I have to admit, after listening to the first track \\"A Girl Named You\\", that I was literally fiending for more. As I am patiently waiting for Psalm's debut release on Rhymesayers Entertainment, Psalm One has been put on my list of top femcees in hip hop(the only other female to be on that list is Jean Grae).

Continuing to purchase these I found out I was wrong. Many are still vital. Unfortunately Echo isn't one of them. They copy much of their old material, many times the worst stuff and have become rather bland. Three songs are worhtwhile here and they are not classics.

Too bad there isn't more, hopefully they will regain their magic."},{"rating":"2","title":"influential band","review":"Echo and The Bunnymen are one of the most influential bands of the past twenty-five years. Their early records were amazing and groundbreaking. They had a bit more pop inspired albums in the later 1980s. There were a few solo projects and side projects. I think that there was even one Bunnymen record with Ian McCulloch. But they are back with another new album, with the ominous title Siberia. There are only two Bunnymen left. The first impression I have is that it is good. They have gone back to the sounds of Heaven Up Here. There is much backward glancing. I like songs like \\"Parthenon Drive\\" and \\"Of A Life.\\" They remind me of old songs like \\"Villiers Terrace\\" and \\"A Promise.\\" Another late great one is \\"Scissors In The Sand.\\" Sometimes four or five great songs can carry a whole album and make it worthwhile"},{"rating":"1","title":"I !have not received it yet","review":"Sorry, I cannot rate yet, as I have not received the item!

The 11 selections are over in about 18 minutes. The producers try to give you a bit more for your money in selecting five Berlin songs (in one case Dinah Shore repeating DOIN WHAT COMES NATURALLY)performed by popular artists of the day, but this only brings the total timing for the CD to about 35 minutes. This is for ANNIE lovers only and purists who must have all the cast recordings regardless of the quality.

Now there are two new characters: Waluigi (a mix between Wario and Luigi) and Daisy (another girl character). There are over 70 new minigames and no old ones. I like all of them. There is now a story mode and a party mode. The Story Mode is a single player mode where you go through all of the boards in order to earn \\"stamps\\". If you earn all the stamps, you're done with story mode. Party Mode is where you can party with multiple players on a Battle Royal Map (from the classic Mario Party games) or on a Duel Map (2 player special map). The story is that the Millennium Star, a star born once in a thousand years, falls down by Mario and his friends. They all start arguing about who should keep it. They decide to play Mario Party to figure out who is the Superstar. You should definitely buy this game.

I was very upset though when I started playing and found out that if you started the game as a one-player, you could not change a computer player to a non-computer player if a friend wanted to join. You could in Mario Party 2. Instead, now you have to start all over and that's no fun. I do however like the fast mode where the computer player are really fast.

Get This Game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Mario Party yet!","review":"If you are a fan of the Mario Party series as I am, you will adore this game. First, there are loads of all new mini games. Unlike the move from Mario Party 1 to 2, they didn't keep a whole lot of the same mini games. Second, the dual mode is excellent -an all new way for two people to play Mario Party. Another change I really like is the items. Unlike in Mario Party 2 (Mario Party 1 didn't have items) you can carry up to three items at a time. In addition, when you land on an item space, you may play an item game, or Toad or Baby Bowser may come down and ask you a question, if they like your answer they may give you up to three items. I love most of the games here. Hours of fun and entertainment. If you are already a fan of the Mario Party series, I highly recommend picking this one up. If you are just getting started in the MP experience, try this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Romances? More like, Great Disappointments","review":"For me, I was disappointed in my copy of \\"Lovers.\\" Mostly, because I consider 'true lovers' to actually stay together. Many of the couples featured in this book became separated or divorced. Sorry, not my idea of true love, or romance either.Plus, I'd prefer more photos than just the single one per couple. The lowercase font used as a title for each bio was really annoying, and the format (one large photo and an essay), tedious. Also, there were few contemporary 'lovers.'Since its publication this book has become obsolete. (As the ill-fated Anne Heche and Ellen deGenerres romance will suggest).Overall, I've seen books which handle this subject much better. I'd give this one a pass, or pick it up at the library before purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee table book","review":"This is the type of book that people will actually pick up and delve into. Photo books don't have the same punch, and longer articles are too much to invite the casual brouser to read. Each profiled couple is one page worth of commentary and the facing page a black and white photo, so that your guests can read one or two entries easily. Yeah, the Anne Heche/Ellen Degeneras entry is a bust, but most of the rest are classic couples. As a coffee table book it is 5 stars -- among the best -- but I'll take a star off since as a regular book you would probably want more photos and details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece on Violence","review":"This masterpiece is oddly structured--it consists of a short essay with a few hundred pages of richly detailed content footnotes--but it is a must for anyone interested in the human as predator.

If you purchase this unit, I suggest you replace the screws with ones that have a larger head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminally Overlooked Soul Singer!!!","review":"STAX must really have been in disarray for Ruby Johnson not to have hit it big, because she is every bit as great as Aretha Franklin, Etta James & Irma Thomas -- and this CD proves it! There have got to be about ten GREAT songs on it starting with I'll Run Your Hurt Away all the way to the amazing Weak Spot. Ruby can really belt it out as she does on What More Can A Woman Do, but the slow burners best showcase her gritty vocal style. Songs like Left Over Love, When My Love Comes Down and I'd Better Check On Myself are positively dripping with soul!

Flambards was one of our favorites because it was one of the first series in the early 1980s we had ever seen that was captioned. 30+ plus years later and some genius decided that captioning was too expensive or that people's hearing must be getting better, and there is no longer need for captioning movies--\\"no reason to try to make any money selling this thing.\\" Or, with the increase in globalization, it would be better to limit their product to one segment of the population in one language by doing away with subtitles in other languages or even in English.---how do these people get these jobs?

I cannot tell all of the BBC and British movies that we have had to return or find ourselves stuck with because they are not captioned or subtitled.

It's real STINKER... in every respect. I kept hoping for improvement but, alas, it did not happen. About 30 minutes into the second disc, I switched to FF3 for the remainder of the \\"story\\".The story line was very weak, the direction nonexistent. I have seen eighth-grade plays that had better acting, and the music (I use the term loosely) was atrocious. Not only was it weird, it also frequently drowned out the dialogue... perhaps that wasn't a bad thing, considering. I sincerely regret having spent money for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to disagree, but this series is extremely dated.","review":"I think it's great when people find a series they love, unfortunately, I bought this series on the recommendation of people's reviews on this site, and found it very weak - I too love a good British dramatic series but this one falls far short of the mark. The music is horrendous, David Fanshawe should be ashamed for writing such a dated soundtrack! The music is a cross between a silent film of the twenties and a 50's sci-fi movie - if you could just turn the music track off the series would be 100% improved. The acting is very broad and at times laughable, I can't comment on the story as I haven't gotten past the first two episodes! I think unfortunately many people's reviews are based on fond memories when it was first aired, but this series is extremely dated, and I think many people will be extremely dissapointed with it, as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best miniseries that has ever been made.","review":"As a young child I watched this miniseries with my mother.

Christine McKenna is wonderful as the vibrant and tender Christina, and the cinematography is brilliant. Not to mention the music (warning: once you hear the theme, you'll be humming it for weeks!). My one criticism is the lack of any scenes from World War I, which had such a profound effect on that generation."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL with a capital D","review":"I could barely give this a 2 star rating. The story is so very dull, the characters are flat and uninteresting. It seems to go on for hours and hours with nothing really happening. I hung in, hoping that things would change and hoping to at least get a small amount of enjoyment after the hefty price of the set. One of the most annoying things about this series is the HORRIBLE sound track. Completely eerie, weird and inappropriate music plays throughout the film. I started to mute it whenever a new episode began, just to get through the credits. If you like early 20th century airplanes OR horses, go for it. But if you want an enjoyable series pass on this one, I wish I had.Check out \\"Larkrise to Candleford\\" or \\"Cranford\\" or anything by Catherine Cookson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a series","review":"I first saw this series many years ago on the ABC(Australia).

After reading and rereading it over many years, my admiration for Kawabata as a writer only increases. There is something so comforting about the domesticity in this book, despite any problems in the domestic landscape. The style of the book and the writing is pure genius. It captures the essence of the lives it portrays like poetic prose. There is zen in the simplicity and the structure of this book. It makes you want to get up and move to Japan, or at least visit. It makes you want to learn Japanese so that you can read this beautiful writing in the original, even though the Sidensticker translation is great in itself. I'm still thinking about what the sound of the mountain could be. Kawabata is the apex of world literature, and this book is very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautiful but can't get past the sexism","review":"The aesthetic details of nature is poetic, the book is full of nuances. Full of existentialist narratives, I really appreciated the subtlety, but I can't get past how Shingo treats his daughter in-law like a concubine/servant. I must have counted a million times where he tells her to fetch his slippers or robe or whatnot...then when his son's mistress is pregnant, I get the vibe that he's more concerned about his rep and his grandson being born illegitimate, rather than the welfare of the woman and about to be single mother, who by the way was abused by Shingo's son, and Shingo seems almost passive to cast any reproach. And his constant thoughts of how his wife is not as pretty as her sister, how he settled for second best, and how his daughter looks even uglier than his wife, it's no wonder how disgruntled and indignant his daughter acts.Apparently, many things were lost in the translation, maybe a new edition/translated version should come out..."},{"rating":"1","title":"SPOILERS in Reviews","review":"WATCH OUT, many plot SPOILERS in the reviews here.

The descriptions of scenery and trivial movements is overdone and detract from the final story. There were many points throughout the book that I just couldn't figure out what was going on because the writing was so muddled and the primary thread was simply not continuous.The book reads like a puzzle. The story is thin, and Kawabata attempts to weave every scene, every action into some over-arching theme (old ways good, but new ways may have good points too) that simply left me cold. However, there are many who like this kind of storytelling, so my experience should be taken with an appropriate amount of salt grains.Not having read the book in its original language, I can't say whether the translation helped or hurt the book. The words and sentences were certainly poetic, but ultimately empty. The poetry simply couldn't carry the poor plot, if anything it hindered it all the more."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first investment book","review":"Although you don't hear too much about Marty Zweig anymore, in the late 80's and early 90's he was the authoritive voice in investing and in my book, still is.This book was my first investment book.

I thought it could have been a lot more interesting. There was a father that was really cruel and was beating his son to make him keep his only focus on the football playing.

That kind of spotlight creates intense expectations for the Permian High School Football Team to succeed, causing players to make tough choices and live with the consequences.Billy Bob Thornton does an inspiring turn as the football coach who rallies the team after a season-ending injury to a key player. His leadership and mentoring of the team causes the players to come together and make the best of their situation and of each other. The movie avoids a cliche ending but leaves the viewer with the sense that what the players accomplish together will be with them all their lives.This film is highly recommended as an excellent capture of high school sports as preparation for the challenges of adult life."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok.","review":"This movie is no were near as good as the tv series.

The characters in this film are so strong, QB Mike Winchell, James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, Chavez, Don Billingsly and even the quite Ivory Christian was a strong character as well as Coach Gaines.This portrays how crazy high school football can be in Texas and how sometimes it may go a little too far. The radio announcers were a strong feature to this as well. The players doing actual football plays, blood, pain in their voices, sadness, triumph, partying.

As a teacher who helps prep students for the college admissions tests, I know what most students are willing to do. Hours of study and review over a long period of time may be the ideal, but it is an unrealistic ask of most teenagers. Their most efficient use of time is to take practice tests and then look over the problems missed. This book has real questions direct from the source combined with good explanations of all answers. The overall review sections are short and to the point. Students may take practice tests one section at a time to avoid burnout (but must understand why they missed each question). A few hours spent preparing with this method will raise scores, probability of admission to certain schools and the amount of scholarship money a student is likely to earn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Great as it seems","review":"This book is really great if all your big need is some practice test.BUT, if you looking for something to renew your lesson, this book is NOT the one.

More like a guide and a teacher, teaching you how to solve the problem too. It really helpful to me, more than this book it self.When I do the test questions in this REAL ACT book, yes there are answers with tiny explanation of why the right answer is what, but not in detail of how to get to that right answer in deep.

Amazon was the cheapest I could find the filters for, so I purchased them.

This is different from regular Indian movies, which are usually long, dull, and predictable. Bichhoo is different, and even though it is a copy of Leon the Professional, it is great for an Indian movie. The story doesn't go soft and dry, the songs are not much of a disturbance to the pace, and Bobby Deol is believable as a tough-as-nails, battle-hardened, cold-blooded hero for hire! I didn't like his anti-cursing and anti-smoking attitude though, that was not realistic, not to mention his drinking milk like a good little boy, while he kills people for a living, was a bit out of place, oh well, this is an Indian movie afterall. The opening song with Hansraj Hans was a nice touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good prisoner movie","review":"The story line for this movie is a good basic erotic fiction theme. The mild BDSM is good.

That's interesting, it probably means the version I posted a review for was the \\"cut\\" version, referring to the film rather than the members that probably distinguish the two versions.In fact, I was reviewing from seeing the uncut version, and therefore I'm guessing the difference is a couple of X rated hardcore scenes during the escape/revenge plot time that occur near the end of the film. If so, you can ignore this version if you already have the old, because the sex really adds nothing of interest for sleaze fans. Who needs to see more of that, considering that 100 such scenes, far superior in quality, are posted on the alt.binaries.erotica newsgroup alone . . . each day??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak girl/girl scenes in an otherwise lame video!","review":"I guess back in 1980 this one was groundbreaking, but today it comes across as a very so-so women-in-prison film. The scenes involving women with other women are disappointing and not at all erotic. Yes, there's some nudity, but not much else. There's a lot of violence, but it's mostly stupid stuff that is supposed to look real but looks pathetic instead.There's one interesting scene near the beginning where the female warden entertains a wealthy woman, showing her a pretty female inmate she can purchase for her own pleasure. A great idea, but later, once she actually owns the girl, their scenes together are bland and unimaginative. And finally, after the girl has tried to run away one too many times, she drowns her in a really fakey scene on the beach. Like I said, unerotic and pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome WIP Grinder","review":"This was one of the best WIP movies I have seen for sexual content. Nothing R about this one, soft X. Do not try to enjoy as a family movie. Lots of nudity, g/g sex, some penetration. You get the idea. Women are not bad looking, some of the sex is hectic, but who cares. No plot, no dialogue, jumpy camera work but who cares. But it is somewhat erotic, such as a scene where a young prisoner is ogled voyuer style then sold to an older wealthy woman for \\"companionship\\".

Of course now, warranty is long gone (even with extended warranty due to purchase with visa card - still have to pay $90 for labor; parts are another $95 that visa will pay). Rather disappointed unit only provided 5 months use. Reading other reviews at various on-line sites, other owners have also complained about Toshiba quality. Now looking for my next dvd player; I'll keep looking, excluding Toshiba. If you do buy, get an extended warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"sudden disapointment","review":"At first, my wife and I were delighted with this DVD Player. We purchased it from Amazon in conjunction with a Toshiba flat screen television for a great price in a special.Sadly, the DVD player ceased working only a few months after purchase. One day it just didn't play or turn on any more. The full warranty is only for 3 months, and after that you have to pay for shipping and labor for up to a year. We've had this for about 4 months now, so the cost of the manufacturer to repair or send us a refurbished one would be similar to what it would cost to by a new DVD player.We love the television, and the DVD player was great for a simple player. But I thought others should know that it died way to quickly for at least one person out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with sound and dvd display.","review":"I'm having a problem with the sound on this dvd player. In order to hear it, I have to turn up the volume on the tv to as high as it will go. I've done everything I can think of to solve this problem including checking the hook up between my tv and dvd player and changing the audio settings. The dvd display on the front panel of the player also will not work. I've tried the FL DIM button on the remote as instucted in the owner's manual, but nothing helps. I just got the player in December and started having trouble a few months back. I'm seriously thinking about purchasing another dvd player, but don't know if I will buy another Toshiba because of the problems with this player that I've not even had for a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound doesn't work; dvd player less than a year old","review":"I bought this DVD player for my husband for Christmas last year because it was rated a Consumer Report best buy.

This player has a good price, but it regularly pauses, skips, even stops on DVD's. Even on brand new, never played DVD's. I took one DVD back to the store 3 times thinking it was the DVD.....but NO. I am truly convinced it is the player. It is very disappointing to get totally engrossed in a movie, watching it with friends, surround sound on and getting the full effect, when all of a sudden it pauses....or skips. VERY disappointing, not to mention embarrassing. I wish I hadn't bought it on-line. It would be easier to take back. I will continue to buy on-line, just not electronic products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this one ...If you want a headache!","review":"I received this player just over a week ago. Being my first DVD I was very impressed with the video/sound quality that the DVD yielded. However, I experienced some skipping in the first 3 movies that I watched (all of which were brand new!). During the third movie, the player locked up. I stopped the movie and began to play it again. The DVD locked up again. So I tried to take the movie out to test another one to be sure it was the player and not the disc. But the player's tray would not fully open. It opened about 1/3 of the way and then made an aweful grinding noise, then closed again. This occur over and over. It's going back where I purchased it for a better model. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Even Last a Year","review":"Do not buy this machine.

I put the disc in and it would. not. play. Toshiba customer service (ha! I can't believe those people get paid to be so stupid) blamed it on dirty DVD's. Not the case here. I took the player back to where I bought it and exchanged it for another one. Got it home, got it hooked up (which took forever because I'm a little dense when it comes to these things), and it still would not play. Took this one back, got my money back, and am going to buy a Panasonic this time, even though I'm a little scared to because I'm having such bad experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great.....When it Worked!!!","review":"I thought I was getting a great deal on an player that would be adequate for an average viewer, watching 1-2 movies a week. It was fantastic for the first three months, with no problems whatsoever...then on the 98th day(yes, that's right, a mere 8 days past the warranty) it simply stopped working. It refuses to turn on, and the cost of repair is more than half of the original cost of the unit. Very disappointing! Will not be purchasing anything Toshiba in the future. Strongly recommend spending a few extra bucks on a unit with at least a year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"I treated myself to my first DVD player for Christmas and used it three times before the audio failed.

Office Space. Every other movie I have tried to watch freezes up at some point. The Mummy, Mummy Returns, Gladiator, Aliens,Cats and Dogs, Star Wars, and Castaway all freeze. And not just a quick freeze. I mean the kind of freeze where you go to the bathroom, get a soda, make a sandwich, and sit back down... and then maybe it will start back up. I have tried numerous times to contact the tech support folks at Toshiba and after sitting on hold for about 30 to 45 minutes, I get disconnected. I just hate this thing so much now. And the best part is, I can go out and buy another dvd player or pay to have this one \\"fixed\\". I would just look at other players. Don't buy this unless you like the built in potty break features of the freeze ups.

When started up it played good for five seconds then the whole picture [ ] out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok","review":"I just purchased this product two weeks ago. The picture looks great on my old Panasonic Tv. I don't like the fact that it does not play cd-r or cd-wr, but that is my fault for not checking into that before I purchased it. Also the remote control doesn't work that great. I have to be directly in front of the player for it to work. I thought it was the batteries, but when I put new ones in I still had the same problem. Should have purchased a Panasonic or a Sony. I'm really considering sending this product back and purchasing something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one bites the dust","review":"Like many others here, I also got burned by this unit. I bought this Toshiba SD1700 DVD Player used from a certain online auction site. It worked fine for a few months.

Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound card","review":"I bought this model in 12/01 based on Consumer Reports recommendation, and initially it worked great. We moved to Japan in June and after hooking everything up again, the sound was distorted. Had someone look at it and he said the left channel was distorted from a faulty sound card. Cost to repair? $180!Thankfully, I paid for this with VISA, so I will be filing a claim through their extended warranty program. The repairman looked at the back of the player where it said \\"Made in China\\" and said that was the problem. If it's made in Germany or Japan, he said, then the quality is good.Perhaps overall, Toshiba does OK with repair ratings, but it's clear this particular model has some issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish these reviews were here when I bought it!","review":"I thought this was the best cheap DVD player for the money, but now I realize it was just CHEAP. Mine also worked for only 5 viewings, then the digital display disappeared and the sound no longer works. I have tried hooking it up to several TVs in my home, all with the same result. Of course it's past warranty and not worth the $ to fix. I'll be trashing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ultimate Biography","review":"When discussing the life of Einstein it is never clear whether one's focus should be on the simple biographical facts, the scientific work or his political and social activism. This book attempts a distillation and mostly succeeds because it captures the essense of the man who was simultaneously many things - a complex, gentle person who became a persona.For a long time he was defined by the equation E=MC2 but over time his other theoretical work has been explored (and many times dismissed) and more importantly, his early years and the ideas that emerged from that era have come more sharply into focus. The author provides a wealth of data on the European life of Einstein which is interesting in itself.The author waxes eloquently on the non-scientific side of the man, the humanist that the world knows today. This is a beautiful, complete work covering all aspects of Einstein's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mean Spirited!","review":"I have but four words for anyone thinking of getting this horrible book: Get Roger Ebert's book instead"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter SWF critic seeks equally bitter SWM critic","review":"Is Pauline Kael married?

Even in rerun,they very seldom run an entire series in order, through to the end, so I am reading reviews about Season 6 and how it wasn't as good etc. except for the last 2 episodes, you know the FINALE. Well, this will be the last time I don't do my homework as other reviewers stated. This is not the last 2 episodes and these 2 episodes are not even written well. What a needless deception and it puts a real bad taste in my mouth and wallet about buying any part of the Series.

An example would be a Harpoon Missile being used to shoot down a cruise missle.The Harpoon is a Surface to Surface or Air-Surface anti ship missile with a top speed under the speed of sound not an Surface to Air or Air to Air anti aircraft/cruise missile weapon platform which would have a speed in excess of Mach 2.Another issue is the fact the he would lead us to believe that the SAS, arguably the finest counter-terrorist force in the world, would fail to sucessfully investigate the background of an officer under consideration for joining the regiment.Mr. Robinson states in his book that he has numerous contacts within the military community and if so I would suggest that they be allowed to read the book before publication to correct inaccuracies such as I and others have detailed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A joke","review":"The premise is interesting, but the execution and political campaigning is amateurish. I'm a big fan of the techno-thrillers, but Patrick Robinson's pro-GOP, anti-Democrat bent is ridiculous... bordering on juvenile. This book is more like an episode of Johnny Quest as written by Rush Limbaugh. If you have only moments to spare before your plane starts boarding and this is the only available book at the news stand, then maybe give it a try. But you may be better off just staring at the seatback in front of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will drive the PC crowd nuts, but so bad it also drives everyone else nuts","review":"As a staunch conservative, I enjoyed the idea of reading an enthusiactically anti-PC novel, since virtually all other novels these days are blatently and pathetically PC regardless of subject matter. But this novel was so full of errors, contradictions, and obvious mistakes that I couldn't make myself love it.On another but related point, anyone likely to read this novel has certainly read The Hunt for Red October. As such, any reader is likely to know at least a little about basic submarine warfare. I found myself continually exasperated with the silly way the rogue submarine was pursued (and repeatedly lost) and how \\"passive\\" sonar would ping and \\"active\\" sonar somehow was never an option. And don't get the idea that these were the worst holes in the story. This book was bad, really bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good leave your brain at the door action novel","review":"Although I agree with the earlier reviewers concerning the author's departure from the realistic use of the military and government... this is still an enjoyable book. Obviously not set in reality but I usually read to \\"get away from it all\\" and NOT deal with reality for a while. I think if not taken as a plot based in reality but wholly for entertainment value, readers will enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than terrible","review":"I've been a fan of political and military-oriented thrillers for years, and have never read such a poorly written book as this one. Mr. Robinson is totally out of his element writing on the inner workings of the US government and military. However, what he lacks in actual knowledge, he makes up for with terrible writing.The premise of this book is valid, but his execution of the story is laughable. Ironically enough, his characters laugh at almost everything, especially at the wrong time. It's as if Mr. Robinson accidentally set out to write a book for the cricket and tea crowd.It's painfully clear that he did little research to prepare for this novel. The characters are shallow, poorly constructed, or outright unbelievable. Their motivations make no sense. Oh yes, and let's not forget the nonsense \\"liberal democrats will destroy everything we know and love\\" plot line.Save your money, this book isn't worth the paper it's written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish nonsense","review":"Patrick Robinson's common sense has gone to the bottom faster than the \\"towelhead\\" submarine in Scimtar SL-2. In his previous novel he developed the character of the brilliant, but evil, Hamas \\"General\\" who was a former British SAS officer gone rogue and returned to his moslem roots. In this silly book the general has gone from rogue to wooden. His antagonist the American hero, Admiral Morgan, is a nutcase who decides to take over the US government temporarily to save us from a jerk president who is too liberal to see the danger facing us. If that weren't enough Robinson has \\"Teddy\\" Kennedy, yes Teddy Kennedy, actively supporting the treason of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.This book was probably written while the author was high. Avoid it. It stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOTH SAD AND HILARIOUS IN AN UNINTENDED WAY","review":"I picked this book up in a used bookstore for a buck in hardcover, still a waste of money. I'm a minor fan of good techno-thrillers, those that have at least a factual basis. It's a good thing that laughter is good for the soul because this travesty kept me rolling and laughing. I read this while lounging on a beach in Oregon, almost caused a tsunami, I think. Previous reviewers have detailed many of the technical faults, so I won't go into them again. Other reviewers have mentioned the two-dimensional characters; one-dimensional is more like it. On a note not mentioned by other reviewers, the author in his Acknowledgements at the end of the book, wrote that he had the assistance of several former Special Ops soldiers and eminent scientists, all of whom he declined to identify. They must have read the manuscript before it was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, boring read!","review":"For somebody who has read all of Patrick Robinson's work, I was thrilled with Nimitz Class, and emmensely enjoyed Kilo Class, liked the first half of HMS Unseen. From there on, it was a downhill run. Mr Robinson should clearly start writing about something other than submarines. Compared with his previous work, the plot is unoriginal, thin, and the characters boring, and hardly developed at all. In fact, his imagination was so strained that has re-visited topics raised in earlier works. If you want a really good read, pick Nimitz Class or Kilo Class. The rest are rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part II of Baracuda 945 - Snoozer","review":"This takes over from where Barracuda 945 left off, sinking. Hey, we're going to blow you up, guess where. We'll even give you clues so you can catch us. DUH! Oh Patrick, you failed miserably with these last two writings. A big disappointment. Way too much emphasis on describing the characters, their idiosyncrasies, moods, and what they're frickin eating. I want action. If I want to read about food I'd buy a cook book. Change brands of that Scotch Whiskey, Patrick, and go back to your old one and write like you once did, with conviction. Hopefully I'll see it in Hunter Killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed... what happened to Clancy and Robinson?","review":"I loved Robinson's first 2 or 3 books. However, he seems to have gone down the same path as Tom Clancy. They are now writing books not worth reading.In the current book, Scimitar SL-2, there are numerous mistakes. For example, when did we have a \\"Secretary of State For Defense\\" ???

Golding, whose most famous book is Lord of the Flies, tells in The Spire the story of an Dean Jocelin's obsession to add a 400-foot tall spire to his English Cathedral. All, including the builder, tell Jocelin that this is impossible, as the building lacks adequate foundation. Nonetheless, Jocelin persists, going mad in the process. While much of the writing and language of this book is first-rate, I found it difficult to either pay attention or follow the plot. I found myself rereading many parts of the book with no greater comprehension than the first time through. For me, this was one of those books which I was thankful was short."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest novels in the English canon.","review":"William Golding's reach in this novel is prodigious. Not only does he demonstrate that the one historical constant is human nature, he also manages to flesh out the scope of behaviour admitted in one particlar human being.

It deals with how human beings cope with pain, loss, ambition, vision and the tenderest of feelings.

Wallowing in the kind of salacious, dime novel prose he so willingly condemns the press for using to create the Manson-as-icon, he takes on that annoyingly presumptuous \\"voice of the characters\\" style of journalism that hypnotizes mass market readers. Surprisingly, as a quickie-cash-in, the only factual errors he makes are very minor, but Manson scholars will find only silliness here and no one but pure collectors need consider it a necessary buy, unless you happen upon a 1970 1st edition of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impact","review":"This book is a starting point for those who should be mentoring others in discipleship.

And boy am I lucky that I tried it before dropping $50 for it.Well, everyone knows about the concept and cool graphics and all. The game suffered no slow down even with multi-tap on. But after playing for a short time, I realized how bad this game is. The controls are difficult, the power-ups are useless in a race (you need to use shortcuts to win). And worse, the carts move way too slow. The fun of any cart racing (ala Mario Kart or even Rumble Racing ) is that it's fast. This game felt like I was moving at snail pace.I wish that they would put Mario Kart on PS2 (though never happen) or someone come up with a true kart game. The closest out right now is Rumble Racing which is definitely worth the look if you're looking for cart racing type game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst game ever!!","review":"This is by far THE worst game I have ever played on any system. I don't see how anyone could think this game is fun.

It is basically two hundred pages of a police officer's wife complaining about being a police officer's wife.

However, the book claimed to be \\"a book of help and hope for police families.\\" Well, I guess my main point is I didn't find too much help and hope.

Doing nothing about it will not make it \\"go away\\" & will, ultimately, ensure defeat of your marriage.COPS DON'T CRY is a serious & good book, no matter which profession you or your spouse is in.

I can say that the latest film is miles better than this one. As Sara Crewe, Shirley Temple is WAY miscast. But since 20th Century Fox had her as their studio prodigy, it's pretty understandable. However, I never though she could really ACT, and this film didn't change my perception of her. When she tries to display emotions, she simply overacts during her numerous crying scenes in the film. Thank God this was one of her last films as a child star. In the 1995 remake, Liesel Matthews gave a more realistic child performance, didn't overact during her crying scenes, and she made me believe that her character was in danger and somehow suffering. That's something Shirley Temple could only DREAM of doing [making the viewer believe her]. This film version can't hold a candle to the 1995 remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Favorite Shirley Temple Movie","review":"I was dissapointed with this adaptation, as it lacked the spirit and philosophy of the original.

This is one of the movies I will refuse to watch though. The magic of the original story of The Little Princess, by Frances Hodgson Burnett, is desimated with this Disney-ized version. The original story has Sara Crew's father die in war, which entirely turns around the little girl's fortune. But this film gives it a happily ever after Disney ending in which the father ends up not being dead at all. It ruins the plot entirely, and is a disgrace to the original.

I'll confess that, based on this movie, I'm not a Shirley Temple fan (her voice alone is annoying, not to mention her acting ability). She is utterly unconvincing as Sara Crew, and that American accent! Please, can we stop making movies of British literature where all the characters except the main one are truly British? I know this is done so as to appease and appeal to the idiots on our side of the pond, but really, are we so uncultured and stupid, not to mension spoiled, that we won't watch a movie unless it has at least one American actor playing a prominent role? If I had to choose between these two movies, I'd definitely see the 1990's version of this one; at least there, all the characters are Americanized, so one doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.

The movie pulls at your heart constantly from the high's (Sara Crewe's lavish Birthday Party) to the lows of sleeping in the attic to her frantic search to find her lost father."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's shirley? quality poor","review":"I was surprised to see that Shirley Temple is not the star in Heidi.

This story has contingency plans Batman made, in case Justice Leaguers went rogue, stolen and used against them. It is a very enjoyable story and well plotted. The art is not much to talk about, but is by no means poor.

Batman keeping tabs on everyone is believeable but the way he is going to deal with each person is not logical or very Batmanish. His plans are too cartoonish.

The WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS MAN!","review":"This book is a MUST read for any fan of Batman because it really shows you how deadly Batman can be and how much a genius he truly is! Basically, the book is about Batman making protocols to take down the JLA just in case they go rogue (turn into bad guys) but that's all I'll say. Mark Waid who is my favorite comicbook writer did an excellent job with this storyline and he adds a lot of great surprises to it as well. The art work in this comic could've been better but it good enough. I rate it a 5 because of the storyline though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra stuff in the beginning and the end with the core story (middle) being overrated.","review":"I got this trade paper back because I have heard a lot about this story over the years and though I should read it before the animated movie based off of it came out.The trade starts with a story that while interesting on its own has nothing to do with the core store. After the core story is over there are a couple \\"short story\\" pages with some team up stuff that also has nothing to do with the core story.The Tower of Babel story itself felt rushed and not well thought out. Part of this could be because I knew the premise of the plot before I started, but it doesn't excuse the plot holes (mentioned in other reviews).I'd gladly give the Tower of Babel story itself a 3 star (although it be a low 3 star), but the fact that the compilation also had a lot of extra stuff just to fill out the book seems wasteful to me in a lot of ways.

There are literally hundreds of definitions in this book, and while many are defined correctly, some are not and show off the biasedness of this book.

I was able to raise my score from a 7 to 11 on the mcat over the course of 5 wks and that is pretty cool! Prep companies will teach you the whole thing with underlining and stuff but honestly, ont he actual test, you'll see that the only way to score above a 10 is to finish the entire test and that's what examkracker teaches you to do for this section. However, i have to say that the one thing i am disappointed by is the fact that this book does not have the variety that mcat has. For instance, the mcat verbal is broken down into 3 sections, history, social sciences, or literature. This book does not have enough literature which is actually one of the hardest sections to do.

Try to get your hands on a lot of verbal passages (be careful, don't buy any of the teaching solutions MCAT products, this is one of those garbage prep materials the EK author was talking about) and work through the problems.

For whatever reason, the systems drains the rechargeable battery, even when you aren't using it. Disconnecting it from the player seems to help, but only some what.

All that said, it does sound great.I'm not making the same mistake twice, so I'm going to give the Nomad II MG a try. It's expensive for only 64MB of memory but it comes with a docking station, judging by reviews the FM tuner seems to work better than on the Intel (and you can record from FM directly into memory), and it's expandable using standard SmartMedia cards (unlike the Rio 800).

I typically get about three hours of playing time out of my unit before it fails. In addition, the player crashes at random, requiring removal and re-insertion of the battery pack before it will operate. On some occassions, this does not fix the crash, with the player displaying \\"ready to download,\\" and only replacing the firmware fixes the crash.

SonicBlue = Quality problems","review":"I was told that the March version of the Rio 800 was fixed.Well, the battery problem seems to be fixed (so far), but now I'm having a problem with audio quality. All of my tracks (which play fine on my computer and CD MP3 player) are all garbled. I'm assuming this is a problem with the flash memory.I was a huge SonicBlue fan because of their innovative products, but their horrific customer service and technical support has changed my view. SonicBlue just doesn't seem to get it. I've sold all my stock and am returning this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"after 8 months of use","review":"I bought the player because of its compatibility with formats from Audible - audio books. After 8 months, the battery is at 30% of its supposed strength, if you are lucky you can use it 3 hours instead of the claimed 11 hours. The battery dies real quick even if you do not switch it on. The display is flimsy. Hard to read - the oval display does not allow to see the full text. The menu has a lot of features, and 128MB is quite helpful, if your battery makes it. The box is made of cheap material that can break to easy. I also own a Rio 500,which is not working anymore.These are my last buys of Rio products. I do not understand its popularity: must be good marketing. I recommend using a device with AA battery slots, so you can put fresh power in, where ever you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead within 24 hours","review":"My story goes as follows: I purchased the Rio 800 128MB despite the poor reviews (big mistake), I charged overnight as per instructions. Next morning it lasted about an hour and died. Then I recharged it and used it again for about 2 hours, paused it, then it died again. Tried another recharge and it was totally dead this time - wouldn't even turn on. The software also froze on me three times trying to get MP3's copied onto the unit (Windows ME). I rang Tech Support and was told that 'sometimes the customer can damage the unit charging it - it must be returned'. IMHO a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing blows don't buy it!","review":"After reading all the crappy reviews of this product I though maybe I'd be one of the lucky ones. I was wrong. I got this and transfered about 22 MP3s to it. As I listened to it as I rode my bike I realized that all the MP3s had a \\"hiccup\\" in them. Sounds kinda like a skip on a cd. All of the files I had on it came from a cd or right off my computer from being downloaded. All the files had this \\"skip\\" sound in them. But all the files, when I listend to them on my computer, where fine. I also tried transfering an entire cd using Windows Media Player. They were transfered by converting them to WMA files. When I played them back on the RI0 800 POS it couldnt even get through most of the songs without gettin all grabled and skiping to the next track. Dont buy this product. Too many people are having issues with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete garbage","review":"This thing is complete garbage.

It had numerous problems with sound quality from popping to cutting out, to skipping. I got authorization to send it back and waited 2 months for my replacement. What I got in replacement was a Rio 64. It has the same problems as the Rio 128 I sent in. E-mails to customer support get me no response now.

That is way over what it should be.And I'm sure there have been many units shipped that charge perfectly fine and I'm sure the unit works great after that, but a company that ships out such a poor product knowing full well that their understaffed tech support will be way bogged down should not get anyone's business.It's a shame that I wasted all my time on this product and my girlfriend will still not have a working gift tomorrow morning.

The first unit I got couldn't hold a charge, so I returned it and received another one which couldn't hold a charge. This even after I had received a new adapter of the type recommended by Sonic Blue.Besides the battery performance, the interface was difficult to use and non-intuitive. It was never really clear to me that the center button functioned as an \\"OK\\" or \\"select\\" button - maybe it should have been labelled.I would also stay from this product for other reasons. The first one I got didn't play sound to the right earphone, even when I changed headphones.Overall, a very disappointing experience.

Overall, I would give this device very low marks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"They may have fixed all of the problems they were having with the player but I doubt they fixed their horrible tech support. Even if rio did finally fix the problems I would never buy anyhting from a company that realeases something so dysfunctional. I had all the same problems everyone else had. The player would only work for about 3 minutes at a time and in the end it stopped turning on all together. I sent it back once and they sent me one with the exact same problems. I told them the new one didn't work, wrote them two emails, and they never responded. It was a complete waste of money not to mention all the time I spent recallibrating that stupid battery.

The only downside is the extremely aquard software. After installing the hardware I recomend you use music match for tranfering your music. It can actually be downlaoded for free at MusicMatch.com. This software is alot easier faster and overall a muchbetter piece of software. The mp3 player has a great battery life.

I'll probably get an Arcos Jukebox (the 6gb one), or maybe an Intel Pocket Concert.Again, THIS ISN'T WORTH GETTING!!.Note: I purchased two of these, one for me, one for my little brother.

First, the software that comes with it is absolutely terrible, and the company that makes the software has gone out of business. Second, the player typically breaks within 2-3 days. I've read a number of other reviews, and based on my own experience with the product, you get about two decent days out of it. When you have to return it (when, not if) there is no customer service number to call, and the emails that you send typically don't get answered for 2-3 weeks. My first Rio 800 broke back in Nov-01, and it took unitl Apr-02 for them to finally ship me a new one. This new one broke within a week, and I have now started the ...process of replacing it. ...

I bought a Rio500, my wife has a Rio500 and now I have the Rio800. We also very briefly had a RioVolt 90 CD player. The quality on all 4 products has been abysmal. The Rio800 has rechargable batteries which they claim have 11 hours of use between charges. 5 hours is more like it for the first 6 months, now it's about 4 hours (a little over a year old). There is no option for replacing the battery. I've also noticed after a year of use (now out of warranty), I get these bizzare screeching or warbling noises in the middle of playing music or audio books. Now the thing stopped working all together. The features of this product were right on target, but Rio really has a lot to learn about quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"the rio 800 is great if they send you one that works!!","review":"this would be a great mp3 player if only it could work propely, ive had 3 of these players & have had to send each of them back within a day after recieving them for various reasons.doesnt this company check there products before they ship them out?i think that they should.for the few minutes that it was working though it sounded great."},{"rating":"1","title":"battery problems not fixed; customer support is awful","review":"I have spent the last several months trying to get a working Rio 800 128 meg unit. I am on my FIFTH defective unit, all exhibiting the same battery charging problems already documented here (charges up to 11 hours, then dies after about an hour or less). Do NOT give SonicBlue your money! I heartily recommend the Apple iPod if you are looking for a superb MP3 player (and it's got a 5 or 10 GB hard drive as well) and much better customer support. I am thoroughly disgusted with SonicBlue. They refuse to refund my money, too, in spite of the fact that I'm on the fifth non-working unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Very Careful","review":"When you plan to spend more than US$200.00 on a portable MP3 Player you expect to buy the Top of the line, or at least one of the best. Incredibly the Rio 800 is the worst electronic piece I ever turned my hands on. First, when you download your music (even 128 bit) when you play it back you hear some jumpin' and sounds in your songs, when you check your originals they are 100% fine, so it's just the MP3 player. But that's not the worst, the worst is when it get halted, you have to take out the battery and put it again in irder to reset it. I take it to the store and they told me that it was ok, after 5 minutes it went halted again. A humble recommendation DO NOT BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"This product, and all products from Rio or Sonicblue, is overrated. For the money spent the product is less than satisfactory. The unit itself is made from thin ... plastic that can easily break, it is notorious for having power problems with its backpacks,you get ... unreliable headphones, the hardware and software do not always recognize each other when installing on the PC harddrive, incredibly poor customer service. Oh yeah, you have to buy memory expansion backpacks from them as opposed to the smart media cards that most mp3 players and portable electronics use now. The only thing good about this Rio 800 is its attractive design and backlit LCD display. Buy an mp3 player from a more reliable company; like the Techno Yepp or Pendant Yepp from Samsung which are comparably priced. Or, splurge and get the Sony mp3 Network Walkman. Don't let the \\"professional\\" magazine reviews fool you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it could last for more than a week","review":"I was pretty excited when I finally got my MP3 player. I set it up put all my music on it, and instantly loved it. Then a week later I went to turn it on and nothing happened. Disappointed, I returned it and ordered another. Again it worked great, and made it to the week mark. Then on day 8 the second one broke. Again I went to turn it on and nothing happened. It looks great, and sounds great when it works. Nothing should break a week after you buy it. It's not even worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really, slow customer service on defective units","review":"I got my Rio 800, installed the software, put the songs on, and listened to music for about 30 minutes. Then all the sudden my player goes into this sleep mode,right in the middle of a song, but I just got done charging it. So, then I put the thing you charge it with in and it woke the player out of sleep mode, and it said that I still had 11 hours of play time! ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad product","review":"My Rio player broke within a year of purchase. The area where I have to plug in the adapter simply loosened up and broke off. To arrange for repairs, I had to call Rio customer service VIA LONG DISTANCE since they do not have a 1-800 number for customer service or technical support, but of course they do have one for Sales Inquiries. Without a warranty, you are asked to fax (again through a long distance fax number) and are charged a fee of $49.95. I will never again buy another RIO product just to have it break within only a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy product, lousy support...","review":"So, I got one of these for my birthday. It seemed like a good choice, but the product was defective out of the package. It kept simply shutting down when I used it. I took it back to the store and exchanged it for another. This one took a month to break - the on/off switch just moves freely and does not turn the product on or off anymore. I first contacted Rio (SonicBlue) nearly two months ago via e-mail. They took over two weeks to reply, stating that the product appeared to be defective (duh) and to get back to them with the same info I had already supplied (don't you love automation?). It has been now nearly a month since that last e-mail (which stressed NOT to send the product back without an RMA). So, I call them (toll call) and they first disconnected me since all lines were busy, then when I called back - they told me there was a 20 minute wait (on my dime). Now I am on hold while waiting to talk to them.I would highy recommend staying away from RIO altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I received my Rio as a gift and was really excited about it at first. After the calibration I went to work. The sound was great and the display is awesome, yet the battery indicator was all over the place. After another calibration I thought that the battery problem was solved. Wrong. After the charging the unit wouldn't even turn on. I received another battery (helps to have spares) and the unit worked again. I was in for a surprise when after another calibration the unit stopped working again...Which made me go online to view user feedback (was I the only one with this problem?). I was not surprised to find many with the same problem, yet some Rios do work fine (as my lucky cousin's). I am not going to take a chance and have the unit replaces, I'm off for another toy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd read the reviews...","review":"You're taking your chances if you buy this one. I bought mine yesterday, and it is dead. I read the manual and followed the directions. The technical support guy, \\"Mike,\\" sounded very surprised that I would have problems. By the way, it took 45 minutes of long-distance hold time to get through. He said I need to return it. What a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's like a Cadillac with a extremely small gas tank.","review":"This product looks good, sounds good and is easy to configure. However, Like all the other reviews here.. The \\"10 hour\\" battery life is more like 1 hour. If you're lucky..I calibrated battery correctly, even tried it twice. I had the most recent revised battery adapter connector that the company 'says' is the correct connector as per their docs.But yet, this product has turned into nothing more than a BUZZKILL to the person whom I bought this for, for Christmas.Yes, and \\"Customer Support\\" is the usual bad joke.Obviously will have to just return the product to the store and try another product with the same features and specs.Seems like the Rio 800 series will do nothing more than increase returns for SonicBlue and sales for the Intel Concert.Highly disappointing product, don't waste your time.WCH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only lasted for half a hour.","review":"I guess I was too opportunistic because I still went ahead and bought it after seeing all the bad reviews. My unit arrived yesterday. I carefully followed the instructions to get it charged and still the unit just went dead after I connected to the charger for 30 minutes. The charging light and the LCD just went off and that was the end of it. Can't turn the unit back on with or without the charger connected. Continued to have it charged overnight and the same thing this morning. I cannot believe SonicBlue still continue to ship it with the defective rate this high.Reconsider if you want to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the battery","review":"I am generally skeptical of rechargable batteries in consumer electronics. My worries were upheld with the Rio 800. Properly calibrating the battery nonetheless led to erroneous power readings and low..low..low battery life (~2 hours, 10 advertised).The screen seems positioned a bit offcenter, making certain menu items frustrating to read. In addition there were dust particles on the inside of the case, impossible to remove.On the plus side, the sound quality is very good and the earphones better than expected. The unit seems sturdy, but in my mind not worth such hassles at such a price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine died too","review":"In June, I bought one of these, but with some trepidation because of the reviews indicating reliability problems. Sure, enough, it worked very well when I received it - better functions than any other 128MB unit I tried. But now, two months later, it has died. All attempts to reach RIO technical support are to no avail. (They don't have an 800 number, so my lengthy waits on hold have been on my nickel, and they don't seem to answer e-mail inquiries.) So, I wouldn't recommend this unit to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Lysa and Sharon have the wonderful gift of covering many topics yet you have the feeling that they are covering them in great depth.

Most important note is on this Kindle edition. It is riddled with typos and errors. It is very difficult to follow. I would recommend you hunt around for another edition or check another platform for your free download of this American classic of the turn of the century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, bad writing!","review":"I have just finished reading Sister Carrie, and until the very last pages I was constantly trying to wipe the sleep out of my eyes! If there has ever been an overrated writer Dreiser is him! Constantly trying to add more details than are needed for a complete understanding of the characters' lives, Dreiser attempts to trap us in their minds--and that is not a place you will want to be. Instead of making us enjoy the characters and feel sorry for them, he makes us wish them to die suddenly on the next page! What an upset!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent character piece","review":"The story of characters deeply entwined and studied in depth.

She certainly knew how to use men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay the extra $2.50 for a publisher's edition","review":"This edition, which was prepared by volunteers, contains numerous errors, dropped words and punctuations, misspellings, wrong tenses, etc. It was so annoying to read that I purchased the Modern Library edition ($3.50) after about 75 pages. The errors are not occasional; they're on virtually every page. Although it's much less expensive, the savings aren't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"The constant typos in this edition ruin Dreiser's literary style. I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe one of the worst readings of an audio book I have ever heard.","review":"The narrator who reads this book uses very little inflection and has an irritating voice to boot. Being an auditory learner, I prefer to listen to books over reading the words; this reader makes it almost painful. Since the material itself is far from scintillating, the reader could make up the difference with a good reading with lots of inflection and characterization, but she doesn't. Blah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting glimpse into history","review":"This book is an interesting commentary on class relations at the beginning of the 20th century. Having been written at the time, I never got the impression that the author was stretching to capture the ethos of the period. The story of a girl leaving home life to escape poverty and experiencing many changes is one that can also be seen in Hardy's Tess D'Ubervilles and Shaw's Pigmalion. In fact, the author was influenced by those authors. The evolution of the characters is delicately written and extremely convincing. My one complaint would be that the characters are somewhat transparent in terms of their emotions and desires."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read!!!","review":"I really enjoy old prose, the old style of writing.

Thankfully, I'm familiar with the novel and Dreiser as a writer, so I noticed that the language--and punctuation--didn't flow as it should. It reads more like a flawed translation than a digital version of the original. Words and punctuation are missing.For 99 cents for Kindle on Amazon, I highly recommend you buy this very complete anthology instead: \\"The Essential Anthology of American Realism (20+ Works) by Horatio Alger, Henry James, Upton Sinclair, Frank Norris, Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, Theodore Dreiser, Stephen Crane\\" http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0032UY45M.In the anthology, you'll not only get a great version of \\"Sister Carrie,\\" but the rest of Dreiser's gilded-age trilogy, plus works by other important American realists like Upton Sinclair, Frank Norris, and Henry James."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dated classic","review":"Perhaps it is because this book is rather dated, but I only found this book to be ok. I found it very old-fashioned and prudish at times - though I am sure it was quite the scandal in its day! It was a day's worth of light reading, something to pass the time. But I would not label it as a favorite of mine.I couldn't help but feel sorry for the men in the story, rather than for Carrie. Carrie is spoiled, manipulative and destructive in her pursuit of the \\"finer things in life\\". The men she uses to get there suffer the most for it!If you like this book, the $2.95 price tag for this edition is worth it! I first downloaded the freebie, but the formatting was so off, I went ahead and downloaded this one. I just wish I had enjoyed the story better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This is one of, if not the most, displeasing thing I've ever read. It's depressing, not cathartic. So it's depressing for no reason. They should attach a packet of Prozac to the last page. The characters are hopeless. You actually wind up rooting for Carrie, just because there is no one else to root for. The book is SO pompous and chauvenist, I could barely stand it. Every female in the story is either cold and materialistic, or young, materialistic and stupid. I haven't encountered such blatant sexism in a \\"classic\\" since Howell's \\"Editha.\\" I will say, though, that Dreiser's actual writing talent is incredible, he has a mystical and dark way with words; too bad he had to waste it on this.

This was the feeling that the entire class had, and so after reading about half of it, the teacher gave up, and we switched to another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carried Away","review":"This novel is a highly entertaining, soap-operatic critique of all that was wrong with the Industrial Revolution. Climb onboard for an emotional trainwreck through the bowels of the urban frontier. Imagine Henry James as a Marxist with a keen eye for fashion, high on caffeine and getting paid by the word, and you'll get a fairly accurate impression of this book. Though Carrie is naive, materialistic, and misguided, she is also compassionate, determined, and ultimately likeable. By making us care about his anchorless shopaholic waif, Dreiser sets us up for a delightfully bumpy ride. The slightly sagging middle chapters are small penance for the many bracing rewards."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Disagree With The Bad Things...","review":"...people have said about this book.

Hooray!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful 1900 novel which will haunt readers in 2000","review":"This novel hooked me from the first page - who can forget the opening scene where the young Caroline Meeber is \\"spotted\\" by the travelling salesman Charles Drouet on the Chicago-bound train? We follow in this novel two seemingly irreversible life flows: Carrie uses her beauty and ambition to rise in life, and Hurstwood falls from his secure position of middle-aged, upper-middle-class success to utter failure, all for the love of a woman half his age. It's the stuff of melodrama to some, but not when handled by Dreiser, who takes the reader into a vividly realized urban world with well-drawn characters whose virtues and vices are equally on display. You leave the book feeling that Carrie and Hurtstwood could very easily have stepped out of the pages of today's newspapers, such is the zone of uncomfortable truth inhabited by the denizens of this brilliant novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes Free is Too Expensive","review":"Sometimes free is too expensive.

Dreiser is a thorough enough author that reading this book through any lens brings new issues and view points to the surface.

There's not a whole lot to be said, this cd is about 40-50 minutes long, has only guitar and bass, and is five tracks long. Most of this is a lot of ambient noise, or creepy guitar sounds played for brief amounts of time. The guitar and bass are almost indecipherable under all the effects, but the droning creates kind of an eerie, yet relaxing feel. In fact, there's a good chance you'll fall asleep listening to this, the reason I can appreciate this is because me and my friends do a lot of recordings just like this one for fun. The most important thing is that Buck and Bill truly enjoy the music they do, such as this record. They put a lot of creativity into it, and pretty much whatever is on thier minds will show up in their work. Pure Imagination, (which Buck covers, coincidentally).So check this out, I'm sure you will enjoy it to some degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Dark","review":"I love ambient, and even darker ambient as in some of Laswell and Buckethead's projects, but this album went off the deep end into menace and depressing gloom.

If you find yourself too happy or positive in life, then play this to bring yourself down and give yourself nightmares. Otherwise, stay away. You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"I think this cd is just a bunch of noise, and I was listening to it, waiting for some type of guitar to enter, but i was dissappointed when i heard some guitar come in at the third song.

I didn't enjoy reading this book of phrases because most of the French expressions were far too advanced for me. I had French in high school and German in college but I pick things up quickly and thought I would be OK with this book. The book is not a good reference for flipping through because a lot of the phrases are just not something you will ever run across while reading literature or even while in France on vacation. Also, it would be impossible to memorize these long phrases and put them to use unless you are very, very advanced in French.

You don't need to read any of these in their entirety to figure out why they suck. Bad prose is just bad prose, although sci-fi readers arn't always the most picky about that sort of thing. So bad that after waiting 20 years to find out what might happen next after Chapterhouse, I find that I'm willing to wait the rest of my life rather read more drek by these guys. There are other terrible flaws with the prequel series, but these are hardly worth getting into.

There is lot of promise in a story which pits man against all-conquering machines, but this team did not develop the potentialities in such a theme. Very bad science, very inadequate imagination of the full developmental potential of a machine-based culture and its powers/potentials. Reads like a word-processor wrote this novel. A machine could do better. Clearly a franchise product, a cookie-cutter product mass-manufactured for an established market (i.e. anything with the trademark DUNE in its title)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glaring flaw","review":"I just had to put the book down. In this book, supposedly we see the theoretical work leading to \\"folding space\\" take its first steps toward practical application. Yet in this pre-hyperspace setting, everyone seems to be able to zip around the galaxy at will, travelling effortlessly between planents and star systems apparently instantaneously. No explanation for this is ever given, which is the type of glaring plot hole that Frank Herbert would never have allowed. Isn't this supposed to be SCIENCE fiction?Pages and page are devoted to meaningless descriptions of trivial details (such as parties), there is no dialogue to speak of, and the character relationships are murky and hard to follow.The DUNE series was much better when it was simply the 6 original books by Frank Herbert, with the tantalizing and never to be fulfilled hints at the final, seventh novel.Each new addition weakens the original Dune achievement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a first draft?","review":"I'm a big fan of Dune and the other Dune Prequels. IMO this is the worst of them (I haven't read the Battle of Corrin yet). I only recommend this book to die hard Dune fans who won't be able to sleep at night knowing they've missed part of the ancient timeline. Even in that case, you could just, read the timeline in the appendix. This book repeats obvious information, over and over again.

Anderson prequels that have recently been published. This is the most disappointing book in the entire series to date! My husband and I both found the storyline lacking and the continuity of this book with the rest of the series is terrible. They put a story together that goes against much of the later series. What were you guys thinking? I won't give away too much of the story but they are terribly lacking and off base in the Norma Cenva story which was originally begun in the God Emperor of Dune book and Harkonnen's story also deviates from the original plot. My husband and I are so terribly disappointed in this book. There are lags in the plot and it's slow reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Having read most of the dune novels, except the house series...this one is pretty decent. It was very irratating at the beginning of this novel, how they kept repeating the information on \\"manion the innocent\\" having read the first in this trilogy and knowing the ending it was not necessary to continously repeat this. If i was not a large fan of the dune series i would probably have stopped reading the book because of this.Character development was decent, but killing off almost all major characters at end of novel was surprising none the less. Guess they didnt want these characters alive in the next novel. However having started to read the battle of corrin now, i understand why these characters were killed off.All in all it is a great book to read, look forward to finishing the last of the trilogy. Just wonder if they will try to write another trilogy in the dune universe somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Machine Crusade","review":"A masterfully written book for the true DUNE lover.

He made me understand the Bene Gesserett by how characters reacted and behaved, without saying stupid things like \\"I'm the greatest sorceress in the universe...\\" I want to laugh at the lack of philosophical introspection, character development, and depth these two authors display compared to Frank. Its a long, labororious read, and its only redeeming feature is that its made from Frank's notes, there-fore its interesting. How these two authors fill in the blanks is so utterly dissapointing. Fortunately the 5% of Frank's genius out of the 95% of the murkyness makes it worth a read. I'll buy the next one too. Re-read your father's book, Brian. Watch how he makes you feel something about Jessica without almost literally saying--as you do-- \\"Feel something about Jessica here.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and silly","review":"Easily the most boring of the non-Frank Herbert series. Very little character development. At times, the plotline is downright silly (Norma's transformation, Holtzman's end, everything about the Titan Hecate, the Cogiters' meddling). The way they explain the so-called Harkonnen treachery was ludicrous. I kept hoping they'd explain the source of the long standing Atreides-Harkonnen animosity, but was very disappointed. Maybe they'll do it on about page 600 of the next (and hopefully last!) book, but I'm not eager to find out anymore.It also seemed like they injected politics of the last couple years into the story. How lame. Hardly worthy of a saga developed over a dozen novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than the Butlerian Jihad but...","review":"I bought this book against my better judgement and because Borders had it 20% off.

But these new books by Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson are fundamentally flawed.In the original Dune books, we were made to understand that the spice Melange is the most important substance in the universe because the Spacing Guild require it to fold space. Without Melange, space folding is not possible and thus space travel will take many many light years. The result, commerce will collapse and the Galactic Empire will disintegrate into chaos.In the Legends of Dune series, Machines and humans are able to wage numerous wars in different star systems at reasonably short periods of time. Trade of slaves, light globes and even spice is thriving. All these achieved even before Space Folding is invented and without the existence of the SPacing Guild.I'm rating the book only 1 star because the authors have decided to throw the basic concepts of the original Dune books out of the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"DUNE Machine Crusade","review":"I was missing this audio book from my collection.

Best wait for the paperback and not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Machine Crusade (Legends of Dune, Book 2)","review":"Boring!!! Normally I don't write reviews, but felt the need to on this one. First I'd like to state that I love the Dune series by Frank Herbert. In my opinion it's the best science fiction ever written. And so far I have enjoyed the prequels written by Brian Herbert. \\"The Machine Crusade\\" has been the exception. I am not even half way through and will have to make myself finish it. Too many story lines going at once and none is developed well. There's no depth to them. They're all flimsy.

I nearly threw the darn thing out the window! So much needless repetition, so many out-of-place and contradictory facts, and so many rehashed cliches and reworded profoundities that I, a few times, actually pulled hair out of my head in frustration!I honestly feel that these authors could do a lot better. There were seeds of a decent story here, but it never sprouted. I never felt pitty for Serena or any of the other overly melodramatic, underly written tragic characters. I cheered when the book was over - because it was over. I think the authors might have used an emotionless thinking machine programmed for endless rewording of the same plot line to complete this long and boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read something else if you're a male","review":"This book is boring, lacks action, and is essentially a modern novel pretending to be sci-fi with too much time spent on male-female relationships. The book is also PC. That isn't surprising when almost all the names are female on the publishing/editorial team that worked on this book. I put this book down after reading half of it.If you are a male then go read a real sci-fi book that isn't going to bore you with almost all the lead male characters all falling in love with boring, plain-looking, and deformed female characters. The one hot female character is described as shallow, cold, and anti-male.The lead female scientist/engineer is female and the lead male one is a bad opportunistic guy and second rate to her. The lead female head of the human Jihad is good and noble, and the lead male Jihad leader a bad guy political opportunist who has no concern for the lives of others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter waste of time and money","review":"If you're a fan of the original Dune books or any of Frank Herbert's writing, do yourself a favor and NEVER buy anything written by his son about the Dune universe. I can only presume that this is nothing but a pathetically inept attempt to make money off the fine works of the father. I picked up this boook and its predecessor, The Butlerian Jihad, at an airport before a long international flight. I managed to struggle through the 1st book mainly on its single virtue of frequent references to the known (and beloved) themes of Dune (my reason for giving it 1 star). The writing is atrocious! I've seen better language control in 12 year olds. I gave up in disgust after getting halfway through the second book. I could literally feel my language skills deteriorating while reading this drivel. Once again, do yourself a favor and buy something else. If you HAVE to have some Dune, re-read the originals. Stay away from this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing Precursor to the Dune Series","review":"Unfortunately Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson have taken the Dune series and turned them into pulp science fiction. There is the same heartless story telling and lack of depth that is endemic of science fiction lately. The authors go to great efforts to make the series an epic battle, a struggle between good and evil, etc. There are so many predictable turns of plot and story that I find myself rooting for computer overlords to win, if for nothing than to kill the more annoying human characters.After finishing the Machine Crusade, I pulled out my trusty Dune Encyclopedia and read about the Butlerian Jihad. I consider the encyclopedia to be somewhat authoritative on the series. ... I also looked at the lineages of Atreides and Harkonnen families. There is no corroboration with the stories that are told there.I would wait for the paperback, or borrow a copy from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it weren't for plot","review":"Crappy writing and craft are barely disguised in this \\"episode\\" of the Dune series.

There are a few good parts of this story, but they are buried by sorrow about lost romance, uninteresting human relationships, and tales of Octa Butler's supreme meal planning ability for her husband Xavier. For example, \\"Octa did this as a gesture to him and her dead sister, serving the tasty meat glazed with a tart currant sauce (p 715).\\" In addition in the space of about 10 pages toward they kill off four of the most interesting characters that they spent the previous novel and most of this one building up in an outrageously unbelievable scenario. Fans of other Dune novels should consider this one an \\"abomination.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"hey, this is actually kinda good!","review":"Unlike Herbert/Anderson's previous \\"Dune\\" trilogy, this time around the second book is not only as good as the first, it's quite a bit better. Sadly, the main problem from \\"the Butlerian Jihad\\" is held over: Herbert/Anderson BADLY need a competent editor. There are so many badly written sentences (and a few out-and-out grammatical errors) that it became distracting.Luckily, the plot is sufficiently good to keep me from being distracted for long. Once again, I can't honestly say that it meshes up perfectly with Frank Herbert's work, but on its own, this is a pretty gripping sci-fi epic, with memorable characters (I'm particularly fond of Erasmus, one of the better villains I've read in a while) and a satisfying ambition.Maybe future editions can clean up some of the sloppy prose and correct some of the errors. It's a shame for a fundamentally good work to be marred by material that is entirely fixable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful ideas dragged through a slow and boring story","review":"I was so excited to read a book dedicated to the principles of anarchism! Where better than sci-fi to explore an anarchist society with a long history and highly articulated ideas. Who better than a highly accomplished writer such as Le Guin to tackle the endeavor? By Odo, was I disappointed.Le Guin's \\"Dispossessed,\\" while generous in its drawing out of anarchist ideas and events, left me bored out of my wits. The plot is thinner than cardboard, the characters are unmoving, and I could find little reason to turn the pages. But turn them I did. I was carried through to the end on the vapors of anarchist imaginings. But I ran out of gas far before I reached the end of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intelligent & influential, but not enjoyable.","review":"There are anarchic tribes on earth & there have been socialist anarchist societies who ran communities in history. You're better off to read about them. I did like the ambiguousness because it made my belief that the capitalist \\"dystopia\\" was better off then the anarchic \\"utopia\\" seem like a valid interpretation. It was also nice to see what someone from an anarchy would be like, since historically speaking I can't think of a working libertarian anarchy. I sort of liked left hand of darkness, but I think UKLG writes some of the most intelligent, but least enjoyable science fiction out there. Don't misunderstand me I do like intelligent stuff like Of Mice & Men, Canticle for leibowitz, The divine comedy, don quixote, etc. I just say that so you won't offhandily disregard this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Social studies disguised as sci-fi.","review":"This book should be of great interest to anyone studying (or having an interest in) anthropology and other social sciences and having an interest in social sci-fi. I didn't like it, though. It is ambiguous in message and cerebral to the point of being annoying. It is a perfect example of 'soft' science fiction, written for the folks who prefer anthropology over physics. The funny thing is, I can't understand why it was in the libertarian Prometheus' Award Hall of Fame, next to 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' by Heinlein and 'Atlas Shrugged' by Rand, since it is completely different from the other winners. If it's given to you, though, it is worth a read, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I could not finish reading this story. Nothing happens.It's philosophy disguised as science fiction. Dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest books ever written","review":"Do books really change people's lives? I've read this book many times over the last decade or so, and it never stops speaking to something deep inside me (and my wife, who I knew I had to marry when she said this was her favorite book). Ursula LeGuin isn't for everyone--you have to be willing to think, and care, and not just space out and be \\"entertained.\\" But for those who want that, who are desperate for that, and like a great story on top of it, well there's no one like Ursula. And there's no Ursula book like The Dispossesed. If you haven't read it by the year 2001, you kind of missed the boat on 20th century literature. Oh, by the way, the book is about anarchy and love and stuff like that. It's about the REAL Utopia, the one that will never happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just utopian sci-fi","review":"The Dispossessed is one of my favourite books - one that almost always gets re-read when I pick it up just by accident. Ursula K. Leguin does construct a world for utopians; but this world is not really a conventional utopia. Our united suffering is one of the key themes, and while the book is often explaned in terms of its idealology, it shines in its personal relationships. I love Shevek, I love Shevek and Takver together, I love Dap with Shevek's younger daughter. Ursula K. Leguin can explore difficult ideas with a flowing style that never makes you think you are being preached or pandered to."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite sci-fi novel","review":"This is a fabulously well-conceived book. I wouldn't call it a utopia, because it is more realistic than that, but it's not a dystopia either. Le Guin has carefully thought through the consequences of anarchism and idealism, while vividly portraying a living world in which her ideas evolve. The attention to detail has made this book stick in my mind years after reading it. If you like sci-fi with more than guns and battleships, this is an intellectual treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"The writing draws you in","review":"Slow-starting, as others have said, but the writing drew me in, which was a good thing, because much of the background detail was not provided until deep into the story. Indeed, some rather crucial details did not appear until near the end.Shevek's twin worlds are not appealing: his native planet is as socially stratified as any communist state and just as poor, while his ancestral planet is a gender-segregated hidebound capitalism that quells mass protest with helicopter gunships.Shevek's attempt to reunite the two worlds, however unlikely, makes reading about them bearable, even compelling. This is the first Le Guin novel I've read, but if they're all this good, I will try more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy the Kindle edition","review":"This is one of my favorite books, but I regret buying the Kindle edition. It's obvious that to prepare this edition Harper Collins ran the book through a cheap OCR and then didn't spend much effort copy-editing the results. Just to take some examples from the first few pages of Chapter 2, the protagonist as a child is described as \\"a lanky eighty-year-old\\"; the correct text would read \\"eight-year-old.\\" Later a character is described as taking \\"a decade at the beach\\"; this should be \\"decad,\\" which is a word used in the setting to indicate a span of ten days.You should read this book, but not this edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't this more popular than Left Hand?","review":"Ditto to all the five-star comments. I read this book after reading Left Hand for a class assignment and flipped-out over it (better than Left Hand - is that possible?) Le Guin has a way of getting under your skin - her characters are memorable with their thought-provoking dialogue. Le Guin is a very talented author - don't miss out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An astonishing, discouraging, truly important book","review":"This book deserves to take its place among the classics that explore the possibilities of creating a just and content society. Unlike Walden 2, or Utopia, the thesis of the Dispossessed is that utopias cannot be realized: the anarchist society of the title already carries the seeds of its own destruction. This is a necessary read for those who mistakenly believe that the \\"End of History\\" has arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Novel of Ideas","review":"This is an excellent novel of ideas. Leguin portrays a nearly stateless society based on small groups of communes inhabiting a arid planet. The residents are exiles from a capitalistic planet, and Leguin uses the capitalist planet as a foil for her utopia. The novel was written in the early 70s when there were still hundreds, maybe thousands of active communes across America and the book is a speculation about how these social ideas might play out if used on a large scale society. The subtitle is 'an ambiguous utopia', Leguin tries to be realistic about the problems that human nature presents to such a society. My only criticism of this novel is that the pace is a bit slow at times, following the life history of the main protagonist sometimes in too much detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition contains abundant typos","review":"This is not a review of the content of the book, but the text itself, specifically the Kindle edition. I am not 10 pages in yet and have already encountered multiple dangling sentence endings and incorrect words (e.g. \\"dock\\" instead of \\"clock\\"). I'm sure this is a great book, but I can't recommend paying $8 for an electronic copy riddled with typographical errors. Yes, it's perfectly readable and comprehensible, but it's annoying and I would expect better from a major publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Comparison Of Socialism With Capitalism","review":"This book shows both the social and personal effects of both types of government organization. It also tells the tale of a naive and brainy rocket scientist named Shevek whose genius is stifled by being stuck on a barely habitable moon.

That is this book, but with the humor. Pages and pages of talk about government styles and philosophies. I suppose this was meant to topical at the time but it comes off as fake and heavy handed. Something else that seemed very odd to me; the author uses 'technical' terms for everything except toilet use which is referred to as with a certain curse word.Obviously a lot of people liked this novel, and was the main reason I read it in the first place. For me, however, it was boring and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outrageous rip-off price by publisher!!!!!","review":"This review was given one star only because I could not give less, and this review is NOT about the book, but is about the profiteering practised by its publisher.HarperCollins must be trying to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Charging $13.77 for a digital copy of a book that sells for as low as $4.65 in paperback should rank as damn near a crime.

That's what I found, except the societies in this novel are so ... blah.It all comes across as too symbolic; sci-fi as moral template of current politics. Like Rand-lite for geeks.

There is nothing here to praise except an unlikeable, dull, and whiney man who is truly not as impressive as he is made out to be. The author tried so hard to create a utopian world where things were supposed to be so efficient as compared to the motherworld that she wants the reader to look past the fact that she gives Shevek everything he is not supposed to want or need. The whole story winds up based around a nuclear family and personal ambition, the very things that she tried so hard to make her readers see past as a cultural need. Also, if I wanted to read anthropological theory in massive chunks, I would go to my bookshelf and pull down one of my many anthro text books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Book","review":"I tentatively picked up this book at the age of 10, guiltily not sure if I was allowed to read an \\"adult\\" book. Although it's protagonist was a physicist and I hated science, this became my favorite book. It offers amazing insights into the innermost thoughts and feelings of one man. Shevek was completley real to me and I could completely empathize with him. I loved the scene when Shevek, as a youth in class, disproves his society's current scientific edicts. The anger in the teachers eyes taught me that people don't always react to the truth kindly. All the characters in this book are utterly genuine, from Shevek's friend who gets exiled from \\"Anarchist\\" society for being too controversial to the fawning housewife on the foreign planet who gives Shevek his first exposure to women with shaved legs. A great quote is when someone asks Shevek if it's true that Men and Women are treated exactly the same on his planet. And Shevek answers \\"That would be a waste of good equipment.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Read This Novel!","review":"The Dispossessed is my favorite work by le Guin-- this is the book I give a copy of to everyone I know. It covers so much ground; you have the whole anarchy vs archism, of course, but gender roles are well explored, theories of time, all sides of the human mental/emotional/social experience that you can fit into a story; there are no one-dimensional characters in this book. Of all the friends i've given this to, there isn't one who hasn't enjoyed it, and there isn't one who hasn't told me how much it made them think."},{"rating":"2","title":"suprisingly thoughtprovoking","review":"I highly recommend this book.

Van den Haag like Paul Johnson and Thomas Cahill later writes from outside the Jewish experience with real appreciation and understanding. Having read the book many years ago I will simply give one small insight of his. According to Van den Haag the intelligence involved in disproprotionate Jewish contribution to scientific and cultural creation came in part because among the Jews the most intelligent the learned were encouraged to have large families, while in the Christian world the most intelligent were priests and encouraged to be celibate. A counter- argument could be made pointing out the relatively small size of the families of the non- Hasidic Jewish leadership. In any case this is one small example of a book rich with insight and certainly worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After 3 Months","review":"After owning this product for three months I was forced to return it. When I first started to use the sweeper I was impressed by its quiet operation and ease to transistion from carpet to hardwood. The quality of the job is what I was expecting for a 40$ sweeper, decent. After the first week the edge sweepers stopped rotating. A few months later the sweeper stopped functioning all together.

You'll either have to use another appliance, or a broom, to pick up what the sweeper has deposited or get down on your hands and knees to pick up what's been left on the floor.

It does not poop out after 3 or 4 minuts but holds its charge for about 45-50 minutes. Sadly though the dust cup craked.so we will buy another bissell from amazon.

It appears that the brushes don't rotate, nor do the side brushes move. Since I initially liked it (it picked up dirt from a footprint on a rug cleanly) it seems to not pick up much anymore, and also leaves a lot of sediment behind when you're done. I kept it plugged in for hours when I anticipated using it so it was fully charged, I used it for both hardwood and low pile rugs, I emptied the canister after each sweeping, and pulled all the hair caught in the roller every time to free it up. I do not recommend this product as I'm pretty certain it either breaks easily or loses strength in a short amount of time. It's not worth my time to try to return it, I just advise buyers to not expect much from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless on tile floors","review":"This sweeper works fine on carpeted areas, but don't count on it to pick up much of anything on tile floors. I bought this primarily for use in the kitchen and laundry room areas, which have tile flooring. I easily assembled the sweeper and charged it as directed. We have cats, and this sweeper picked up a small amount of the cat litter, but the majority of it was pushed into the grout lines between tiles and remained there. Regardless of the angle or speed I used to push the sweeper over the grout lines, the litter remained. If you are only using it on carpet or maybe even wood floors, then this is a decent purchase. If you want to use it on tile, don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Disappointing","review":"I was initially fairly pleased with the Perfect Sweep Turbo, as it did a reasonable job at quick pick-ups. Didn't take long before one of the edge cleaning brushes stopped working, though. I decided to take a chance and disassembled the unit and was able to get the belt back in place, but I do not recommend this operation as it is a real pain to get everything back together. And as it turns out I shouldn't have wasted my time, because soon thereafter the battery started giving out. All in all, I'd say the unit worked for about six months, if you can call 5 minutes of run time working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I previously had a cordless vac which I loved.

Don't buy this sweeper if tou expect it to \\"suck\\" things up. It provides NO suction but a motorized brush roll that spins and rolls things up into the dust cup. I recommend this for occasional use for spills like cereal, rice, etc. As far as being a tool to \\"clean\\" your floors, you will be quite disappointed.

Seems like it could reach under furniture and easily clean stairs.The Bissell works, but not very well. We only use it on oak floors. It really doesn't pick all our pup's fur.

Those are plentiful at most super stores. My mother-in-law has told me to order the Barbie primp and polish off e-bay and she will pay for it. I think not! There is no way I will give someone $50 plus dollars for a piece of plastic. This has been a disappointing search. This doll got a poor rating because I can't find it to prove otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"My daughter got this last Christmas. Anyone that asked what she wanted, that was what she told them. What a total disappointment! She tried styling Barbie's hair probably twice and was totally frustrated with that awful wiry hair that you can't even get the comb through. We also tried the nails once (that equals $10 per time she played with it). I just sold it at a garage sale yesterday for $2.00 and think I probably overpriced it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible","review":"Let's just say that this toy has gone to our local dump! An adult can't even comb through that mop of a hair! A real waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New Toy Not So New","review":"For some reason, I thought I ordered this doll from another store until I reviewed my account and found the order here. The doll's hair looked as if it had been washed and heated over and over. It was coarse and crinkly instead of smooth the way NEW doll hair is. My daughter had anticipated receiving this doll for a year, but she doesn't play with it because she can do nothing with the hair. I usually return damaged items, but we threw away the box and packing material, and I just decided to accept this as a loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor advertising!!!","review":"The doll's nails could stay in ICE WATER for a month, and they wouldn't change color.

If you think you have had a bad hair day before - wait til you see this head! LOL Not worth the money. We took ours to Goodwill (probably should have just put it in the trash.)

The hair was an awful mess and after about 45 minutes of playing with it the entire head detached from the neck portion of the doll. A defective doll!! I was extremely disappointed and so was my daughter. I had to search high and low to find the African American version and to think this is what I search so HARD to find. Never to mention the color changing makeup is a LIE. It never worked !Dont waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I have to say that out of all of the Barbie products I have purchased for my six year old, this is the worst. The packaging is very attractive. My 11 year old son had to help my daughter comb through the hair. The nail polish came off in warm water, and the color went on with cold water. The eye shadow and lip color never worked. My daughter was very disappointed. She asked me to exchange it but there are none left in the stores. The only fun she is having with it right now is with the fake nails she puts on her own hand. To spend the money on a product that doesn't produce is very upsetting, and even more so when you know your child feels disappointed with Santa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Good Choice","review":"I purchased this doll for my 5 year old this past Christmas. [...] The doll's hair was matted and very hard to detangle. This was the caucasion doll. It was a terrible experience and the eye makeup did not change colors.Ironically, I have a $12.00 doll head from the past, that still has silky hair. Go figure. By the way, there were 5 other mothers in line with the same complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no!!","review":"My daughter was excited that she got the one thing she asked for at Christmas but the closer she got to it the less she wanted to do anything with it.... The fishing wire hair was horrible it stands up all over her head and its completely uncontrollable even after washing it. Any one who brought this should definitely get a refund plus 10% because it was a disappointment and at christmas!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the African American dolls?","review":"I have been trying to find this doll everywhere, in stores and online, and it looks like my nieces will be disappointed again this year for Christmas. This doll just happens to be one of the top items on their Christmas lists this year, and I am wondering if the African American doll ever existed. Yes, this doll is hard to find anywhere. However, the Caucasian \\"Primp and Polish Barbie\\" IS available in the store at Toys \\"R\\" Us and also online at amazon.com. I truly don't understand why it is always so hard to find African American dolls. It's as if we're not supposed to have the same dolls in our own race, so that our children can relate to them. All I am saying is that if you are going to offer a doll, you should carry it in the various ethnicities that the manufacturer makes them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hair is the Worse","review":"My daughter wanted this doll forever, so she could not the dolls nails. I finally found this doll and brought it. When we got it home and she played with it for about an hour, I spend about an hour just combing to get straight enough for her to play with it again. Good idea to make a doll head with hands but bad idea for the hair to be so tangled and corse. And for the makeup to be so awful, (I don't have enought time to complain about the nails)...Don't purchase this doll, it's the worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real disappointment, never get's used","review":"I had always wanted one of these when I was little so when my daughter asked for one for Christmas, I jumped on it. Sure wish I would have saved my $ now. It just sits collecting dust. It's not fun at all. First, yes, the hair is horrible. You can get it to curl easily, but brushing/combing is a nightmare and nearly impossible. The makeup and polish is a joke. It never EVER has shown up. Ice cold, just cold, luke warm, hot it doesn't matter what temp the water is, no color whatsoever shows up. I finally had to give my daughter some old makeup to put on the doll. The nails aren't the right size and don't stay on. What a sucky toy. Save your $ and just buy a regular doll to let your child play with. Oh, it's not exactly cheap to be just a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much of a hassle","review":"I bought this for my 4 year-old and wish I never had. After only 4 months of little play, I had to throw it away. The hair was completely tangled and all of the nails had been lost. Save your money and get your child something that won't bore them within a month!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought this toy for my daughter's 4th b-day. I spent hours trying to comb out it's hair and it still looks awful. My daughter still can't even comb it. I bought this on sale for $24. and glad I didn't pay full price. I've seen other styling heads much cheaper and wished I hadn't spent so much on this one. As far as the manicure aspect, I am disappointed as well. The makeup and polish color change isn't even noticable. I am so dissatisfied with this toy that I am going to call Mattel to complain. There is no reason why it should be priced so high for such an inferior product. Save your money and buy a lower priced styling head."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased","review":"The hair is way too hard to manage. It is tangled all the time. We tried everything to get it to be managable.... nothing works.... might help to trim about 5 inches off of her head.... you would think that with as many people that are complaining about it, mattel would step up and ake care of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty gross hair","review":"I am an adult and I could not even get the comb through this doll's hair. How long has Mattel been making dolls? Do not buy this product!! It is a nightmare and the company should be ashamed of even selling it to the poor consumers who actually thought it might look like the picture on the box. If I could I would give this product a -1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bed Head Barbie","review":"I purchased this Style Barbie Head as a gift for my 4 year old daughter for Christmas last year. I was very excited about it, as my little one loved to style, comb and none-the-less rip my hair out in attempts to make it beautiful!! So Barbie was my saving grace! Christmas day she chose Barbie to play with first! After about a half an hour, she had the comb tangled in Barbie's hair, water all over and the stick on nails were in the doll's hair and my daughter's. She was frustrated because the doll's hair was VERY Nappy and hard to manage. Needless to say, I was the one, not \\"Barbie Bed Head\\", to get my hair styled on Christmas Day. We donated this doll to our local charity, my daughter willfully handed it over and said to the volunteer: \\"She isn't very fun for me, her hair is very nasty! But, my mommy said that someone else might like to play with her!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My complaints echo the other ones already listed; hair being a tangled mess and polish and make-up not working. My 5 year old daughter has only played with it a handful of times. She will get frustrated with the hair and give up. She was very disappointed when the nail polish didn't come off like it should have. And,even though she got it over a week ago, we still haven't gotten her hair completely detangled. Her favorite part is putting on the fake nails but I could have bought her a set of fake nails for a lot less money."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"Oh, is this awful! My daughter really wanted it, so we asked her grandparents to buy it for her. I thought that it came with makeup to put on it, but instead you use cold and warm water to create a makeup effect. Of course, this is a pain (to get water for a child to use and spill) and it doesn't work, anyway.The press on nails come with sticky things to help them attach, which she can't use on her own. The hair, as everyone else has mentioned, is awful. So, now we are stuck with this thing. I want to get rid of it in the middle of the night..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed out Mom","review":"My little girl got this from santa and was so excited till we tryed it out. When you apply a certain tempature water the makeup and nail polish is supposed to show up. It didn't and she was very frustrated because it took quite a few applications till we got it to show up a little bit. It was a bummer because the toy was not cheap and we expected it to work, the hair however does actually keep the curl from the curling iron which I was impressed with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I bought this for my neice last Christmas, and the hair was awful. I actually had read the reviews after I bought the toy. So I asked my sister-in-law, based on the reviews I read, if she would like me to exchange it for something else. She said no, because my niece really wanted it. It is now a dust collector. No matter how fun your little girl might think this toy will be, save your money and buy something else! Imagine trying to brush through thousands of strands of fishing line."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAPPY TOY!!!!!!!","review":"DO NOT BUY!We purchased this for our daughter last Christmas. By the time dinner was over that evening the hair on this doll was an uncontrollable rats nest and even adults couldn't fix it. NOW the important thing here is that this was NOT my little girls fault. The hair is made up of OODLES of super fine wires (all of the strands of hair). They knot and then bend around each other and can't be combed out. I HATED this and it really made my little girl sad when after only a few min at best the hair couldn't be played with. I am now looking for another Head like this one but with smooth hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"My daughter loves the idea of this, and always wants to play with it, but after 10 minutes she is done. How many times can you paint the nails with water? The hair is a nightmare you can't even get the brush or the comb through it. It would be better with silkier hair that they can just brush and braid and put up. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?????","review":"When I was a little girl, granted this was almost 30 years ago, I loved getting out my Barbie head, with all of her make-up, YES, REAL MAKE-UP - NOT WATER, and would make her pretty for hours. I am assuming they wanted to alleviate the mess of make-up by using water, but how much fun is that? REALLY? How much fun IS that? I am so disappointed in this toy, I wish I would have saved mine for my daughter, because, when I sold it about 12 years ago, it was still in perfect condition - hair included."},{"rating":"2","title":"really pretty","review":"i'm 10 but i don't htink anyone is too old for this toy. shes really pretty, and you can learn how to give manicures, and style hair, so its educational if you want to be a hairdresser or beaty stylist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful toy-don't waste your money","review":"I bought this toy for my four year old and it is awful.

I am so sorry I spent my money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surely Disappointing","review":"Our 5 year old received this toy as a gift. We were very excited about playing with it but it's only been two months and the toy is hardly used. Largely due to the fact the hair tangles easily, the curling iron continues to come apart if they grab more than a few stands of hair and the press on nails fail to stick. She has more fun with the simplier styling heads as she can manage the hair herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bird's Nest","review":"I purchased this doll for my 6 year olds birthday.

I will be returning it soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The hair is my worst nightmare come true!","review":"How many times have we painstakingly combed through our daughter's hair, getting through tangles, amongst \\"owws\\" and \\"that hurts?\\" Well, get ready for the worst hair disaster known to man, or woman, or child for that matter. I couldn't believe the state that Barbie's hair was in coming out of the box. It looks as if its been out on the lawn, in a fight with a stray cat, and then left for rats to build a nest in, oh, and then I bought it! The hair is a wiry, tangly, falling out mess! Combing the hair is much too involved for a \\"new\\" toy. It should come out of the box detangled and ready to use. This is rediculous. The makeup feature does not work well at all on her face, however the nails work fine. In spite of this, my daughter loves this toy. I would recommend something else though, if you have not already purchased this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed...","review":"My 6 yr old *really, really, please mama, can Santa bring me this for Xmas, please!!!!\\" wanted this. Her aunt gave it to her for Xmas and she was so excited. Until we actually went to play with it. The makeup on/off with water DOES NOT work. The polish DOES NOT work. The hair is SO KNOTTED that even I (mom) couldn't get the special comb thru it. We followed the directions and this is just a disappointing toy.

DON'T buy this toy.From a disappointed mom,Lora B."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a real disappointment","review":"My 4 year old daughter got this for Christmas. The cold and warm water barely did anything to change the color of Barbie's eye shadow and lips. The nails were a little better but not much. By the time you painted the nail with warm water, the water would cooled off enough that they turned back the normal color. We ended up not using the water and my daughter uses her play make up on the doll head. The hair is the best part, and it was a disappointment. The hair was so matted when I opened the package, that I took over an hour getting the tangles out for her. She can get a comb through it now, but I have to come and detangle from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT","review":"I wanted this toy a lot. I am six years old.

Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Go There","review":"I agree with Terry. The Barbie head we had as a children was much better. There is no fun in putting water on the doll to change the color of the makeup, which doesn't change much at all. And the hair is a mess from the get go and doesn't get any better with time.

Once we removed her we had to use detangler to brush the hair-it took 45 min and still was nappy. The stickers were taped down to the box and therefore not useable. The nails don't stick on and the hot/cold water make-up doesn't work. The applicators for make-up came apart on first use. I would not suggest this for any age girl.

The application crashes constantly while I'm setting up beginnings and endpoints of the digitized music. Roxio support told me to delete a file which did not help. With Mac OSX 10.2.3 you can not listen to the music as you digitize it. Roxio support says this is due to Mac going to OSX and that they have no plans to fix it. There is no \\"help\\" icon. If information is not addressed in the hard copy instructions you are out of luck. This appears to be a quick and dirty application for OS9 that doesn't function well with OSX 10.2.* or later. Spin Doctor was the entire reason that I bought Toast and frankly iTunes (V3) is easier to use than toast when it comes to organizing and using music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"I was really lucky to find this at a DVD exchange store, but after watching all of it I would easily shell out a C-note to buy it new. These films are uber-entertaining, particularly for fans of Quentin Tarintino - who stole a lot from these.The violence and sexuality are presented in a context that is never grotesque. Compare Kill Bill Volume 1 to, say, Saw or Hostel. Although Kill Bill is gratuitously violent, especially in the final fight sequences, it is so over the top that it's more funny than thrilling. Saw and Hostel, on the other hand, are far from funny and are affecting because they are so grotesquely horrifying.So if you liked Kill Bill, check these out. On top of being entertaining, they are also a very interesting reflection of the culture of the 60's and 70's which ultimately inspired the themes that are explored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Treal Tv #2 Horrible!!!","review":"Being a Big Fan of Mac Dre, I belive, wait...

So price is not always a good indicator of quality......Thanks,"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!","review":"This product worked great for almost five years until it developed a leak. I've learned online that this leak is common and is due to a poorly designed seal between plastic and steel pieces. Obviously, Rowenta doesn't care about those who use their products if they design something so poorly. You'd think they outsource their engineering to Kenmore, expert of the \\"break a day after warranty\\" gimmick. There's nothing duo power about this when it's sitting in a puddle of is own water.I pulled a B&D; that I'd recovered from the trash years ago. It does the job without leaking.

I purchased my Rowenta DX6900 about 18 months ago at Tuesday Morning for $50. I have taken very good care to make sure it doesn't fall and get damaged. It has not met my expectations for dependability. I have used tap water or spring water consistently. (Does Tuesday Morning sell items that have been sent back to manufactures with defects, i.e. seconds?)It is leaking from the bottom while in the standing position. Vast quantities -- about half of the volume -- have poured onto my ironing board. The steam is inconsistent, too.

I was hoping they would include some classic DX moments and other rarer matches like Jeff Jarrett from IYH: 2, and a match from 1995 RAW vs. Owen Hart where Shawn gets knocked out. There was also a match that HBK had with Mankind on RAW or the awesome One Night Only Match vs. The British Bulldog, I could go on and on.

Misleading in its packaging and borrowing glowing user reviews from the hardcover book, this is actually a sad substitute (read \\"rip-off\\") for the 1971/72 classic. This one is not animated in the way most people think of animated films. Instead, it shows static graphics from the book art \\"moving\\" around on the screen as if you had cut them out and were sliding them around with your hands. I was super-eager to purchase this for my 2-year old (and myself), but was sadly disappointed at the change in format. They need to make a clearer distinction between this and the original animated classic.If you are looking for that great, original, animated, musical version from childhood, you most likely wantDr. Seuss: The Cat in the Hat[DVD] orDr. Seuss - The Cat in the Hat (Original Television Episode) [VHS] instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cat in My Hat","review":"The Cat in the hat was a great book.

I finally fast forwarded through and around 1:15 a few apparitions/monsters started making an appearance. Otherwise, the entire thing is a couple of kids wandering around a darkened house at night.

The young actors really do a good job, and the movie does a pretty decent job of building suspense in several parts. If you liked \\"Clownhouse\\", then you should enjoy \\"Fear of the Dark\\" as well.

Definitely a kiddie horror, say a 3 year old, sort of film. If you get spooked by R L Stine, then you are beyond this film.Some rather good editing at the final moments brings some neat scares; but, like the first in the SCARECROW films ( where the Actor playing the Scarecrow actually made his own mask) this is a film that should be avoided if you have any other options AT ALL.AVOID."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is false advertising","review":"I ordered this item I did not receive the case and the card dose not work on the wii ferther more the text describing it says its made by Nintendo which it is not.

And it costs less too. UPDATE: it's been 3 years now, it's held up well and am still pleased with the saw.

The Windows XP driver doesn't appear to work at all (it recognizes the unit, but won't see any networks.) The XP driver is also unsigned, and the installation instructions tell the hapless user to simply ignore the unsigned driver warnings from XP. Since they've had plenty of time to have the driver qualified by Microsoft, my guess is they just haven't gone to the trouble to make it reliable enough to pass Logo testing.For what it's worth, I've relegated this thing to use on an older machine running Windows 98, and it seems stable enough in that configuration.Maybe the \\"other\\" WUSB11 and its drivers are more stable.Scott"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!

Beware when using with WinXP....very touchy! Sometimes it works perfectly. Other times it won't connect to the Internet even though it is receiving a perfect signal from the router, which is also Linksys. My Netgear card that I use in my laptop has always worked fine and was cheaper than this lightweight piece of plastic.

The reason we've never moved on to D-Link is because we decided to try Linksys after all the issues we had with Netgear, and Linksys has yet to let us down. I use this particular USB Network Adapter on both of our Tivos as well as the family computer we keep in the kitchen.Occasionally - perhaps once every month, maybe less) - the connection drops, and the only thing that solves it is unplugging the device, waiting a minute or so, then plugging it in again.

At first I suspected outdated drivers and the like, but after almost two weeks of updating, trying and testing I figured out that the system crashes only when the Linksys is attached to the USB port. When I disconnect it my PC becomes 100% stable. I believe these crashes are more frequent when the signal available to the Linksys is in the medium to low range (i.e. when it tries to establish or re-establish connections).Ever since I removed the Linksys WUSB11 my system has been stable as a rock. So I'd advise people to look at other vendors' solutions like Netgear.The silver lining: Linksys got me to update every single driver for every single part of my PC, thank you Linksys."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't go wrong with this device!","review":"I just purchased this wireless USB adapter (WUSB11 - ver 2.6) today - to go along with my Linksys WAP router.

I'm in Heidelberg, Germany and live in a concrete 4-level house - and my router is located two floors below the laptop location. I have a consistent 97-100% signal strength at 11 Mbps - which is much faster than my DSL connection.

I wanted to expand my wireless network and bought the WUSB11.I spent over 2 hours (my saint like patience) trying to get this WUSB11 to connect to my existing network without success. I then called Linksys tech support (the only thing good I can say is they provide 24 hour a day tech support). After one hour they told me my router was the problem (US Robotics 802.11b) - yeah right.I took the Linksys back to Best Buy, exchanged it for the Microsoft MN-510 (USB).

The adapter comes with a USB cable, which has a \\"To USB Adapter\\" label at one end of the cable. After installed the adapter software, I connected that end to the wireless adapter and the other end to my computer. The adapter's Power LED lighted up, but my computer cannot detect the new device. Before I gave up this defect product, I reversed the cable connection to make my computer to recognize it.2. Encryption WEP with 64 bits does not work. Under this encryption scheme, DHCP gets wrong IP configuration. I had to use either no encryption or 128-bit encryption.3. Software installation is straightforward and easy.

Throughput is just about as fast as being directly connected to my cable modem (Earthlink/Time Warner). I use it on a remote desktop machine. The external USB configuration allows me to set the device atop the computer (unlike PCI card versions that obscure the antenna) allowing excellent reception.This unit is a bit long in the tooth for 2010; it only offers WEP (wired equivalent privacy [don't believe it]) security which is a problem. WEP is easily penetrated so if you care about security, I'd recommend you look for a newer device that supports WPA such as the WUSB54G. The newer unit's price is generally comparable. I just ordered my WUSB54G so I can transition my network to WPA; but I'll enjoy the WUSB11 until it arrives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer support is non-existant","review":"I got online with customer support and was told based on my system(win98) on an older pc I needed this adapter.

The instructions wereof no help, the website drivers and filmware didn't work, the phone call to the helpline was a long call without a solution.

Yea, 43 min and got an answer, unfortunately the blades are not available for purchase, Hunter did offer to send me one new fan that I could take the blades off of for replacements, but I declined since it would only be a short term fix until the other blades broke.

I did go to home depot and purchase a remote control to operate the fan and light, at a cost of almost $50.00.

Now that it is installed (five months ago) the housing holding the globe/shade just fell off of the fan the first hot day of summer.

In all, its a good seat, make sure its installed correctly, take it down to your local police station. At 1, this seat looked too big for my daughter (22lbs). We had a EB carrier type at that age. At her current 30 lbs, its a perfect fit, and I feel that she's safe.While the longevity of use is nice, safety is more important of course. This carseat is only rated to 40lbs for a 5 pt harness. I offer you this video for you to decide if at 40lbs you want to change to a belt booster: http://youtube.com/watch?v=azgBhZfcqaQ It also offers an alternative seat that IS rated to 80 lbs for harness. Nascar racers use a harness for the safety it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but I really can't recommend","review":"I purchased this player and have used it now for several months. The player & software work but based on my experience I really can't recommend purchasing this unit. My reasons are that 1) the battery life seems very limited and the player stops working usually after about 2-hours of play. I constantly have to change the batteries and the old ones still have life and work fine in my Walkman. 2) the player's software seems to be problematic and will lock-up on many MP3's that play perfectly fine on my computer. Sometimes the player will just stop for no apparent reason. 3) finally, the menus are a little difficult (bass & treble) to operate when exercising and the skip forward and backwards features to not seem to operate effectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"The is awsome","review":"This product is the best one iv tried yet. It dosent go through batteries like nothing like the other people say it has plenty of memory and i like the color faceplates. This product is easy to use and install. Gets loud when you turn up the volume. Reccommended to all!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for sports use","review":"This is a good product if you don't plan to use it for running. I have found that it seems to have a very bad battery connection and will 'cut out' while I'm running. What makes that especially annoying is that then the unit has to go through the 'power-up' process all over again (takes 15-20 seconds) and you're back at the first song. Of course you can fast forward to the song you were listening to, but this seems to create even more strain on the battery and sometimes the unit cuts out again. I find that the unit only operates properly during the first 1-2 hours on a new battery. From there on out, even though it might say that you have 5 hours left on your battery, you will have problems.If it weren't for this problem it would be a good unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good player but does have some problems","review":"Overall I think this Rio 600 is worth the money. It is reliable, holds a lot of music, sounds great and doesn't skip. I primarily use it for working-out and running. I do like it because it's small enough to wear comfortably so I take it pretty much everywhere. However the headphones are not that great so I bought some Sony sport water resistant ones that sound much better. I also have the problem where it sometimes either won't turn on or it does but freezes and the only way to fix it is to take the battery off and reconnect it. That is a minor inconvienience but I also would rather not have to do it. But as I said, I DO feel is is worth the money and you will enjoy your favorite downloadable songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"player worked for about a year","review":"I had the rio 600 for under a year.

Once I'd figured that out, I listened to it for 2 hours total before the unit completely died. I have spent days trying to get email help from tech support and once I finally got a guy on the line at tech support (on a half-hour long distance call) he said they are no longer making Rio 600s and I had to take it back to the store for a refund. He couldn't help me. What a waste. Sonic Blue has abysmal customer support and products that fail right out of the box. Think seriously before buying a Sonic Blue product.

The power consumption is minimal, it uses 1 AA battery that lasts for ever. Its easy to use, along with the audio.com program. The fast forward/rewind feature zips you through your book easily to find the passage you might want to find. The display is easy to read and simple.The \\"stylish\\" carry case, however leaves much to be desired. It is almost as stylish as my fathers leisure suit, and the window tries to show both the controls and the display but misses both. I did some trimming on mine.The bottom line is that book listeners will love it. no cassettes to deal with or repair. No crying because the player ate one and the rest of the cassette book is worthless. The price of downloading saves 50 to 75%. And after you download the book you can zip it into your Rio in about a minute or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a solid product","review":"I purchased by Rio600 after my Rio500 inexplicably quit working altogether. I would have used another brand, but I primarily use the MP3 player to listen to books from audible.com and there are a limited number of compatible brands. The Rio600 seems really flimsy, the buttons don't work consistently and the battery gage shows full and then jumps to empty within 2 minutes. In addition, the unit emits noise through the output that makes it very difficult for me to use with my SoundFeeder (which is a device that broadcasts the output onto FM radio, so that I can listen in my car without having a cassette input). I would avoid SONICBlue products if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and no remedies","review":"Defective product.

I had to remove and replace the backpack for it to work, even though the POWER SAVER MODE was set to off.Which means, the Rio unit is shorting out the battery.(Before, I only had to charge the battery every other day and I would have the player on two and a half hours every day while working out.)I hope this helped"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great MP3 Player for anyone","review":"I got this mp3 player and I was not disapointed at all, and the sound quality is just great. Very simple and easy to use, it is the best musical device I have. I take it wherever I go, it fits in my pocket. All sounds good, right? Well, the problem I had was that the headphones that came with it were great, but the wire broke right up by the headphone part, too close to repair. I just got some new ones (not the original kind that came with the player) for 6 bucks, and they work fine.

It would not turn on, or display anything on the screen.

They finally sent me a replacement, which lasted about three months and is now broken again, exact same problem. I will not buy an mp3 player or anything else from Rio or its affiliates.

There is a single piece of plastic over all four buttons. It is impossible to reliably press one. or the other.

That's my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but not worth it","review":"the rio 600 is a sharp player. the sound qualty is great, the features are great. but it isn't worth it unless you have a small collection of audio. it just can't hold that much. 64 mb can hold max 25 good length mp3's. and if you want to upgrade sonic blue is the only palce to buy new memory. instead of removable memory cards, they sell backpacks specially for the rio, and the biggest memory card they sell is 128 mb. the controls are also very difficult to work. they are small and you tend to hit the wrong button. if you are looking for a small mp3 player with good sound, it is nice but i don't think it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The bare minimum","review":"I got the RIO for Christmas, while I was really hoping for a Techno Yepp. The RIO works. That's about it, though. The firmware is poorly designed. You have to go through four steps, just to see what time it is. The interface (buttons) are also poor; they feel cheap and are hard to use through the soft clip-on case. Finally, it looks like there's a lot of wasted space in the design. The player could be a little smaller, packed tighter, and feel a little less cheap.That being said, I haven't had any technical problems with my RIO. By tweaking the frequency of the playback, you can squeeze three hours of good quality music on 64 megs.

Based on a true story, the hospital inmates are surprised by reality when war reaches their doorstep and the nurses and doctor abandon the facility.The lead character, Janna, is convinced she is engaged to singer Bryan Adams. His frequent appearances in her fantasies, singing If You Love a Woman, provide comedic interludes among the serious topics of psychosis and war. As the Chechens use the hospital facilities as a base, we see their interactions with the patients and watch Janna fall in love with a Chechen fighter.While the film portrays the Chechens rather sympathetically, its larger message transcends ethnic groups or military factions, questioning the boundaries between sanity and insanity, especially in times of war.A unique film combining comedy, realism and fantasy, this Russian film is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Prime Obsession Instead!!","review":"In this tome about one of the most celebrated conjectures in Mathematics today, there are actually more words attributed to some person not fathoming why the multiplication of two negative numbers yields a positive number than there are to Andrew Wiles and Fermat's Last Theorem. The author spends far too much time on basic concepts while ignoring the major aspects of the Riemann Hypothesis theory. If I wanted basic concepts, I would have read other books.

Morrison, while writing this, was struck with numerous sicknesses, cumulating in an infected lung and a serious life crisis.

I read A Farewell to Arms this summer, and I thought it had to be one of the worst books I've ever read, and that's saying quite a bit. His brief descriptions and simple dialogue bored me. And his description of love! It wasn't love, it was sex. Clearly written from an immoral man's perspective, it was impossible for me to relate to the characters. And the ending, well, it was just stupid. There was no lesson to be learned, no happy ending, nothing that makes a great book great. The entire focus of the book was one man's unrelenting self-pity that eventually cost him everything he held dear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow - that was bad","review":"I heard Hemingway is great so I read this book. In reality what I found out was that Hemingway was depressed. This book is nothing more than the tale of an alcoholic who's disease leads himself and others to destruction.

Tell me how much you love me\\" \\"will you love me forever?\\"Once you're through all that I feel you'll have a good time with it ... besides if you don't, at least it looks good on your bookshelf.

It seemed like a book written for a male mind. The whole book was about love and war. It was hard for me to understand because it was dull and too easy to read. I thought Hemingway chose a horrible way to end the book. After all of the love that was built up between Frederick and Catherine I thought the end was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, this book lacks a source of intrigue.","review":"This book, while portraying realistic portions of World War I, seems more of an attempt to boost the author's ego than to entertain. The way he (the author) has the nurse systematically slobbering over the wounded soldier is nauseating, at times to the point where it is more rewarding to skip the entire section. The only interesting parts that I found in this book were the battle scenes, too bad there were only one or two of them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Left to Mourn","review":"The young, immature characters set against an intense, tragic plot gave the novel as a whole a unique voice that at times only seemed contradictory.I often expect and rely on an author to walk me through the grieving process after a character dies, or at least to devote a couple pages of mourning or after thought. I closed this book and had to take a couple moments of silence. Hemingway just left me to face the death on my own, to come to my own conclusions about life and death. It was time for bed when I ended it but I felt instead like going out and doing something special, of savoring the moment. The next morning, I still had the character's death on my mind and I had to cope with that on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece.","review":"I read this in one sitting and found the style and story to be very gripping - Hemingway draws the reader along with his terse prose, not allowing a pause. Some here have complained about the terse dialogue, which is true, or lack of character development. I found that these criticisms lent the story a directness and Hemingway was able to strip it of all sentimentality. For me, this made the narrative more powerful. The characters tell it how it is. Highly recommended.I intend to now devour more Hemingway: next The Sun Also Rises and a Moveable Feast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only surpassed by For Whom The Bell Tolls","review":"Excellent read about the impact of war on individuals and the importance of relationship between individuals over the things we go to war about.

I found the story not much involved with the world war 1, neither presented to me as a great love story, since the love that arises is quite infantil. The rest of the characters appear in a too second plane, without further involvement. I think the worst part of the novel is definitively the dialogues between the couple: they seem to be the conversation of two 15 year old kids, who the only thing they can say to each other is the nicest and sweetest things ever; all they say to each other is \\"you are awfully nice to me\\" and stuff like that, and that, at least to me, lacks of interest to the reader. The story could have been much better, much more delightful, if this aspect had been more polished. The best is the end, and the inner thoughts of Henry, though is not the end we would have wanted to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"This book, quite simply, was very bland. For one thing, it is too easy to dislike the protagonist (why should I like him?). I agree that the sentence structure and grammar is, at times, quite bizzare. Can anyone tell me why Hemingway always, always uses a contraction? I paid very close attention to the entire book and I found only one time where he did not use it (probably a mistake on his part). The story easily disinterested me, but there are some segments within the book that have some action, and can provide for some relief. Bottom line -- I hate the main character, story [was bad](granted, at times it is a little interesting) , sentences bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A how-to manual, so to speak. . .","review":"Hemingway is experienced at evrything he writes. In this book, his descriptions prove to you that he knows how to drink, that he knows how to eat spaghetti. . . He is the master of not letting us into his life too far, yet somehow just far enough. I think the element of light and dark (as well as dry and wet) are key in this novel. Pay attention to the first chapter as well as the last. The first is almost a chronological outline of the book, and the last ties in well with the first. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but not very intriguing","review":"Hemingway protrays a love story in a time of war. The tedious conversations between the two lovers in the story are pure nonsense and the depiction of the settings in the story are a bore. I also did not find myself involved in the plot, as if the reading was a chore. But the final pages finally got my undivided attention. In the end, I found that the tragic ending made the whole story pull together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway's style makes A Farewell To Arms great.","review":"A Farewell To Arms is an excellent book. Hemingway kept me interested in a story about love and war, two things I usually don't like to read about, because of the style he uses. He is able to describe scenery and events using a minimalist style which creates a story that doesn't stumble over it's own descriptive language as many other books do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Hemingway","review":"This book was very good, however I felt the action of the book dragged on putting the reader to sleep. The story would have been better had it been shorter....I do give Hemingway a very strong credit though! The overall stroy was excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Naturalist","review":"Hemingway sets a mood nonpareil in 20th Century literature in the first paragraph of this novel: \\"In the late summer of that year we lived in a house in a village that looked across the river and the plain to the mountains. In the bed of the river there were pebbles and boulders...water was clear and swiftly moving in the channels...and leaves, stirred by the breeze, falling and the soldiers marching and afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves.\\" The first chapter of FTA sets a mood of doom that pervades the rest of the novel. I have a real problem with Hemingway's metaphysical musings (the world breaks you, et. al.), but for clarity and objectivity in prose, Hemingway stands as a giant in literature. This is a great book, abeit a supremely depressing read. Read it for the style, not the substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, hated it","review":"Hadn't read any Hemingway for 30 years. I remember his writing as to-the-point and without unnecessary embellishments - a style I like. I was really surprised by Farewell To Arms. I found the main characters unlikeable and the dialogue between them excruciatingly twee. Some of his literary devices seem clunky - e.g. the lengthy sentences at the beginning with many, many clauses linked by 'and.... and .... and'. The narrative got going with the retreat - finally some substance. Otherwise, the war was a picturesque backdrop to an endless succession of meals and drinks. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst, certainly not the best.","review":"The story itself wasn't too bad, not exactly origional, but I've read worse. I found the characters to be rather flat, there was little development throughout the book. The dialogue, however, is the worst I have ever read. In fairly long conversations, the same thing is said ten times and the conversation as a whole never says anything new, or interesting. Not a terrible read, but I wouldn't recomend it, or ever read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a true piece of literature","review":"I am only a freshman in highschool, and I know I don't get everything (or at least not as much as most) other, better educated individuals do. I do know that this is a great book. It is a love story and a war story wrapped together. Catherine Barkley(a British nurse)and Frederick Henry (an American ambulance driver in the Italian army)are a beautiful picure of love within war time. The lovers go through much to have a simple, peaceful life. They do accomplish this for a time. However, like other Hemingway novels the ending isn't \\"happy\\". Even though, I can't imagine it ending any other way. If you will take my advice, read this book. It is a wonderful experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"It's been a long time since I've read Hemingway, so it took me a few chapters to get used to his writing style and to get into the story. The depictions of battle weren't as brutal as, say, All Quiet on the Western Front, and Henry's romance with nurse Catherine Barkley delivered a nice reprieve from the front line action. This novel definitely delivers commentary on solders' disenchantment with war, especially with Henry's role as an American officer in the Italian army. It also illustrates the presence of tragedy off the battlefield as Henry's idyllic life is shattered. At times I found myself bemused at his detachment and indifference in the face of personal misfortune. Overall, this is a classic novel that has endured for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway","review":"Although a very well know author I had not read his books. It was an interesting writing style. However, the female main character was overly sweet - in the current era we'd probably call 'ditzy.' I found her very tiresome during their meeting, later escape and life together in Switzerland. The tragic ending to the story was unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"The More The Merrier","review":"As I read the first chapter I didn't imagine myself finishing the book. The repetitive descriptions were uninteresting. However, the more I read the book, the more I found myself enjoying Hemingway's work. I got caught up in finding the outcome of Frederick's love affair and the war. As always when reading a book you learn to look at certain thing at a different perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell...to this Book!!","review":"I also read this because I have heard a great deal about Hemingway. I have previously read The Old Man and the Sea, and really enjoyed that. But this book was torture.Someone else mentioned the dialogue, and they're right. It is the worst dialogue I have EVER read. I dare you to find people who talk like that! I know the book was written in the 50's or so, but there's no way people have ever spoken like this. Maybe the characters all had shell shock...And the whole love affair seemed strange. The girl hardly knew the central character, and was talking about love on the first date, all the while the guy didn't seem to care about her. I found myself hoping they would break up, just to move on. But, they don't. So, I skipped half the book and read the end. I suggest the same.Anyway, if you are looking to read Hemingway, I can only advise you to skip this book. Life is short, read a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"one horrible novel","review":"This has to be one of the worst books ever written. I don't understand the mystique surrounding Hemingway. There is no character development, the dialogue is juvenile and stilted and there is very little plot. I'll never get the time I spent reading this novel back; so do yourself a favor, and spend the couple of days it would take you to read this to read something worthy of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad.","review":"Bad reading; the descriptions are okay, but the characters stink. The heroine doesn't seem lovable and great, she's crazy and stupid. It's bad.

My brain could not take the boredom come on Hemingway this story made you go down the drain. I highly recommend that you take a nice sedative before engaging in this book. Otherwise it will reak havoc on your brain. The story ws dumb the relationship between Henry and Caroline pointless. I do not recommend this story to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, dated Hemingway","review":"Poor Ernest! Rather than retaining his modernist importance, his \\"unadorned with a vengeance\\" style and macho persona have fallen the way of parody and this, his \\"best\\" novel, clearly shows why. As with so many stylistic extremists, one finds oneself focusing on the writing and not on the written (the former bizarre, the latter dull and unconvincing). And his adoring women, \\"hot\\" for the hero, remind me of an old Mae West movie where the men, for no better reason than they were written that way, are constantly praising the invisible charms of our heroine. Time has moved on; so should we."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST book of all TIME!","review":"I was actually looking forward to reading this but from page one I couldn't keep my eyes open. The characters had all the personality of wood chips! Infact, it would be more interesting to sit and watch the dog poop in my back yard petrify! I have never read such a boring book in all my life. It was EXTEREMLY hard to finish. It actually took me 1 month! And if I had to hear GOD'S name in vain one more time I would have burned the book, but it wasn't mine so UNFORTUNATLY I couldn't! Well, I'll will give it some credit..........the front cover is BEAUTIFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding","review":"Note that my evaluation of this book is that of a reader--not an English professor, or a lit/crit grad student, or historian. I am sure the book has many merits from those perspectives, where it fits in as far as the canon of American Lit., war books, etc. However, as a novel to be picked up and read for enjoyment, it must rank as one of the most boring and stilted I have come across. It goes nowhere. Nothing much happens for pages at a time. The dialogue is uninteresting, and the characters are surprisingly predictable and one dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell To Arms","review":"As I continue to read books that I probably should have read in HS I am constantly surprised by how much I dislike them and am convinced that the people who make these selections have no idea what it is like to be an average American male student. There is a reason why 15-18 y.o. boys generally dislike English courses in HS and I am of the opinion that it is because the people who think these selections are brilliant enter the field of education and continue the cycle of selecting books that have little or no appeal to the average male.Farewell to Arms is a dreary, monotonous, diary of inane conversations that only serve to introduce Frederic's tale of woe. The only interesting part is his escape from the police on the bridge and then their escape to Switzerland. It was a wonderful inducement to a good night's sleep for quite some time since I only read a few pages each night before falling soundly asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by its cover","review":"I bought this book thinking it was going to look like the product in the images.

False advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, mundane, and journalistic.","review":"Considering myself reasonably well-read, but never having delved into Hemingway, I picked up \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\" I was disappointed. As a 20th Century novel, it pales beside the works of Evelyn Waugh, Mikhail Bulgakov, Somerset Maugham and even John Barth. \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" has not withstood the test of time. It is shallow, dated, predictable and characters are not well-formed. For a much better novel on the World War I era, try Ford Madox Ford's \\"Parade's End.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing novel","review":"A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway is a dreadfully boring novel. The characters Catherine and Frederick, are mindless nits wrapped up in their love affair, while enlisted in World War I. I thought the book lacked a single intelligent thought throughout its contents.To me a good book is one that is thought provoking and makes one think, and when coming near the end gets a feeling as if they had befriended the characters. In a Farewell to Arms, the only thing I thought about was the frivolity of the characters and how they were devoid of any verisimilitude. I only wished that the end would come quicker so I wouldn't have to read another drawn out conversation on the reassurance of their love for another. I strongly urge any reader of books on compassion and intelligence to stray from opening A Farewell to Arms."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"I think this has to be the best work that Hemingway ever produced, and the best book that I have read.

It is a book that is good thru and thru. it is a book that I will read again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"So true, so hard and yet so deep.","review":"I've had some problems with Hemingway before, especially \\"The old man and the sea\\" but I realized that his kind of writing is the kind you grow into understanding. To say this or that about it before understanding it is not only dumb but also a way of pushing it in front of you since Hemingway wrote so true and so cold and due to that, he wrote with emotions and that's what makes \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" worth five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, it has a few kinks but I like it","review":"I loved A FAREWELL TO ARMS, even though Hemingway's overmasculine approach hurt Catherine as a character. I simplyenjoyed the story a lot, Frederck and Catherine trying toescape from the war. Its was beautiful and tragic. Thelanguage used by Hemingway is very simple and easy to read. Infact it goes very quickly. The end was simply gut renching, butforeshadowed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Farewell To Arms","review":"Very interesting novel. The author participated in WWI and it is possible that some of the descriptions are factual.The outcome.....Please read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Farewell To Arms","review":"This book was a great example of the writing exhibited by Ernest Hemmingway. The story was one of great tragedy that followed a young man through his tour of duty in Italy during WW1. There was a slight hill in the book where one was lost in details of him in the hospital. However, for the most part the book was exciting and kept me interested. It is a great book and truly an interesting view on war on the European front. Hemmingway used this man's view to depict his views about war from when he served during WW1. For as the main character goes through pain and suffering in the war Hemmingway seems to be showing some of his own experiences in his tour of duty. Overall this book is a good read and can shed light on an interesting topic while keeping you attached to a strong story as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hemingway, a national treasure","review":"This is an easy, fast paced book to read which follows the bitterweet romance of an ambulance driver and a brave, young nurse. The book focuses in on the brutal truth of war, separating it apart from hundreds of other glorified war-romance books. Written in Hemingway's easily identified tight prose, and it is easy to get the feel that he was writing about himself. (Hemingway was an ambulance driver in Italy during WWI) That touch of possibly revealing himself to the reader makes this book even more touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Farewell To Arms","review":"The book A Farewell To Arms was great. It had a great plot filled with many suprises. The wonderful story of the book made me rate it 9 out of 10. A Farewell To Arms involves a great love story of Lieutenant Henry and Catherine Barkely during WWI. Lieutenant Henry is in the military during the war and Catherine Barkley is the nurse during the war. When Henry gets injured during a battle, he then goes to the hospital and meets Catherine. As Henery is in the hospital curing up, he then starts liking Catherine. They both fall in love but dont marry yet because they're still in war. Later these two lovers get into problems which may cause them to break up. To find out what happenes to Henery or Catherine, read A Farewell To Arms. This book has a great intersting story, not like other books which keep on talking about love. This book contains action, romance, and mystery. I would recommend this book to everyone. I hope you read this book and find it intersting."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is Hemingway's greatest novel","review":"I have taught Hemingway in high school and think that AFTA is the most wonderful novel he ever wrote. His heroine is one of his most liberated. Although in most of his books the women were weak there is nothing wrong with this one. The last lines remain etched on my mind forever, Thanks Ernest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"If I had the money, I would go out and buy a copy of this book for everybody I know.To date, this is one of the finest Hemingway novels I have read. More than just a war-torn romance story, it's a very real depiction of the horrors of battle. While this formula has been come to be viewed as vintage Hemingway, those reading the book for the first time will see it as a fresh and original story. I had no idea what would happen from one chapter to the next and the ending of the books comes as a harsh surprise (although a throughly logical one.)This is one of the most important novels about World War 1 and the effects it had on the people involved with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has its moments, but generally disappointing","review":"I'm 14, and I had to read this for school. It was the first book by Hemingway I'd read...and probably will be the last, at least until I'm forced to read another.I thought this book was dull in the extreme. It was full of huge passages of irrelevant small talk and pointless details. I also found the main characters, particularly Catherine, the female heroine, unconvincing as well as unlikeable.Although I didn't really enjoy this book, I respect it, and I realise that others might find Hemingway's style easier and more enjoyable to read than I did. Just don't expect it to be one of those unputdownable passionate war novels which you remember for the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the emperor's clothes?","review":"I looked forward to reading this book but was very disappointed by its plodding clipped style. The dialogue between the 2(poorly developed) main characters is tedious and uninspired. The well touted passages about life at the front seemed to bog down in the mud that was being described. Maybe reading S-Faulk's \\"Birdsong\\" first, raised the bar of my expectations too high?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ick","review":"I'm sorry but someone actually said the CATHERINE was what women want to be like. May I starve in Somalia first. (Actually, that's hyperbole. I would rather be a stupid peice of cardboard with no taste in men than die. But only just.) This book has a grand total of two things to recommend it. One, it is required to get an A. That's a reason right there. Two, it has a vocabulary a third grader could understand, thus getting the torture over with quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do yourself a favor and not read this book","review":"I literally forced myself to read this book... and what a waste of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The way Henry and Catherine express love you would think they were 15 years old. If you really want to read a GREAT book about love, friendship basically all the things that really mean something in life please try \\"Three Comrades by Erich Maria Remarque\\" and if you want to see what it was like during WW1 please read \\"All Quiet on the Western Front -- by Erich Maria Remarque\\"Bottom line: stay away from this book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the fuss about?","review":"the two most boring \\"lovers\\" ever written. a complete absence of passion/feeling. totally flat characterization. \\"dialogue\\" that would embarrass a budding high school author. what on earth did either see in the other (would ANYONE else be attracted to either of these cardboard images?)WHY were they in love? how did it happen? the glowing praise of this \\"love among the ruins of war\\" escapes me entirely. who cares what happened to these two individuals?....give Hemingway credit for his geographic descriptions; on the other hand , it's not thought to be a \\"travel\\" novel.Greatly over-rated, and as Harold Bloom has noted elsewhere, Hemingway's novels (as opposed to his short stories) are coming to be seen as period pieces, not enduring literature. that's even generous for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is plot not trendy?","review":"Let's see: Minimalist sentence structure, narrative, character development, and plot (especially plot). This novel reminds me of those rooms with one chair (wooden) and one window (no curtains) which we're supposed to appreciate. Less is more and all that. Is it, really? I had wanted to rent the movie, but am afraid it will be one of those long dark-scened things where characters talk (\\"meaningfully\\") on and on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Finished last night and found his writing style almost terrible with constantly repeated phrases, long run-on paragraphs, very slow moving - then little bursts of activity - then more long, slow repeated lines over and over again. Finally, the ending was just horrible. Both what happens, and the abrupt way he truncates the story. It was not worth the time it took to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like this Book","review":"I really didn't like the book very much. The Dialogue was very repetitive. I guess that's the way people talked to each other back in the early 1900's. Also, didn't like the ending. \\"Mr. Henry\\" was kind of a jerk in my opinion. He kept saying how much he loved his girlfriend who did anything and everything for him. But he seemed not to care about the baby she was going to have and paid little attention to her feelings and her health while she was pregnant. I mean why did he let her drink so much during her pregnancy. Hemingway made her sound like a \\"complete idiot\\". Don't think I will read any more of his books. I guess people back in the forties thought it was a great book. I disagree"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Farewell to Arms","review":"This was the first Hemingway book I've read...or I should say tried to read. I thought it was tedious, self-indulgent and boring. I always finish reading books, but I just couldn't bring myself to finish this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very enjoyable","review":"This is my second Hemingway book I've read after \\"The Sun also Rises\\". I had seen where this was a highly regarded novel, and a \\"Classic.\\" I must say I beg to differ. This one was mildly better, but still not very enjoyable. It takes place during WW I and follows the life of an ambulance driver (which Hemingway actually was). The book picks up in the second half when the main character flees the army, but the ending was so depressing, I don't think I'll be reading any more Hemingway any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice, steady read","review":"This story is not too terribly difficult to write about because the reason it is so good lies in a couple of very subtle things. One of the most interesting things I found with the story is how relentlessly I wanted to understand more about the two main characters. This seemed to be planned from the beginning and as the closing chapters Hemingway has us rooting for their success. I fail to say more about the plot because there are about 5 or 6 total scenes in which the book takes place and I do not want to spoil anything.If you like Hemingway, you should certainly read this. If you are coming to this book for the first time and you're wondering whether to read it or some other Hemingway, I would recommend it highly. Either way you will get a good sense of what Hemingway writes through this, and some of my skeptical friends say that once you've read one, you've read them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hemmingway's best","review":"This is one of the better classical literature books I have read. I enjoyed it more because of my interest in the World Wars. Hemmingway writes about his experiences in Italy towards the end of the war showing what the war was like from the American prospective before we entered officially. It is well written and the story flows from page to page. Well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Priced wrong...","review":"First of all, let me say that I am a Kindle lover. Having said that, lets look at the pricing here. I can pay $12.99 for the Kindle edition, or I can pay $9.60 and get an actual book? Let me think... Honestly, if Kindle and e-books are ever going to last, they have to price the e-book version CHEAPER than the physical book format. I would never pay more for an e-book than I would for the physical copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hemingway rode on the coat tails of F.

In my opinion, if your interested in war novels, then yes I could give it a chance. But for my own interest, i'm not into war novels. Fredrick Henry was the protagonist of the novel; he was a ambulance driver for the Italian Army. You see many sides of Fredrick, but not enough for me to get into his head and relate to him. Fredrick meets a nurse Catherine whom he falls head over heals with her seduction, and loves instantly. The reader follows Fredrick's decisions as in leaving the war, his friends, and everything he was involved with behind for Catherine. Catherine and Fredrick go through many obstacles together, and find themselves moving to Switzerland until they got arrested by the police, but got away. Months pass, Catherine has her baby, but a tragic ending happens to Fredrick Henry. It seems like the same old novel about two star struck lovers who in the end can't be together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much boring dialogue.","review":"I am highly disappointed with this highly touted novel.

It really made no sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I'm consistently amazed at how revered Hemingway is, and at his status in American Literature. I've read three of his books and have never cared about a single character. In this novel especially, I find the dialogue wooden and tedious, often extending to lines of blunt interchanges with no hint at the way words are expressed or received. I don't expect a character to be handed to me neatly analysed and labelled on a plate, but some key focal points from which the reader can form an interpretation are essential in creating a relationship with that character. I find the central characters in this novel impossible to visualise.There are many more subtle and dramatic war/ anti-war novels, and countless better love stories.I just don't get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but certainly not worthy of being called a classic","review":"I read this in high school and now again as an adult in my mid-40s. I am baffled that critics call this a classic (and I was a lit major). The characters lack any complexity, the story has little dramatic tension, and the characters' development is not insightful or even interesting. There are extended conversational passages that lead nowhere and just communicate the main emotion of the book: an ennui--perhaps caused by war, perhaps by the main character's own alienated personality.The only part that really had some insight and even tension(hence the two stars) is the first third in which Hemingway describes war itself and the sensation of being badly injured. This is clearly autobiographical and is much more alive than there rest of the book--after that, it's all predictable and uninteresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Very good book. The Italians are drinking on every other page, which I found funny and the ending was classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"At first I was not a fan of Hemmingway's writing style but the story overpowered whatever problems I had.

This was my first time for \\"A Farewell to Arms.\\" It's a slow starter, but I learned to pace myself. The action is restrained but steady, and I realized gradually that a key element is the relentlessly realistic dialogue. The American protagonist, Frederic Henry, is involved in every scene. The life of the book is his life. His recurring, desultory involvement in his own life and his role in the Italian Army in World War I is the backdrop of his elaborately played out relationship with the nurse, Catherine Barkley. \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" doesn't really seem to be a war novel. On the other hand, except for brief interludes, the characters really don't seem to be at peace. For Henry, it's an ironic farewell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shape for used book it was like new.","review":"the product was just what they said it would be.

It makes many twists and turns, which the writer uses to keep the ready on the edge of their seat. However, these twists and turns seem out of place. Books 1 and 3 rocked!, but books 2, 4, and 5 were quite dull. Also, if the novel had not ended with a dull book, then I would have rated it better. Back to the good side of the novel.

Each prose poem is introduced and then preseneted in both French and English. Then the whole is examined with rigorous closeness and loving attention - never dryly and pompously but with great affection and admiration. He really does bring Mallarmé alive as no else has. For the modern writer of prose poems this is an 'Ur-text' on the prose poem and what it once was and perhaps could be again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The textbook was great, the print was pathetic","review":"The quality of this book as a resource for physics is impeccable.However, the print is often unreadable with letters merged and blurry.

This book is 100% better than any other mechanics book I've looked at. The explanations are very clear, especially for non-inertial & rotational reference frames and the derevations for conservation of energy, momenta, and angular momenta (integrals of motion).Includes extensive section on Euler angle derivation and tops.

I already had a copy from the time I was a student, on the other hand this new edition has a small biography of Landau written by his student, friend and collaborator Lifshitz. That is the reason I got this third edition, the biography reflects the unique feeling students in general had for Landau and the greatness of Lifshitz that for all his life remained sensibly attach to his supervisor. We all treasure and learn from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the Kindle Edition","review":"Amazon, you should be ashamed! This is a wonderful, elegant book, it's the text for my 2012 fall course on graduate classical mechanics, and probably for many such courses worldwide. Most students could really use a Kindle edition--but this one's horrible! Practically illegible, the equations in particular. The beauty has been ruined. For $42, you can surely do better. I'd planned on getting the whole Landau Lifshitz series on Kindle, but not until you get your act together. Please, please fix this -- notice this book is fifty years old and still the best.

Inline equations and symbols are rendered the same way and are sized in a ridiculous way, destroying the flow of the text and even making it hard to decipher in many places. The Landau and Lifshitz theoretical physics series of books are beautiful and for content they all unreservedly deserve six stars on a five-star scale. However, as with all older physics and mathematics books, it seems, the e-book rendering is a horrible mangling. DO NOT buy the Kindle version or, like me, you *will* be sorry and have to return it.

But many physicists think that it isn't suitable as the sole textbook for a graduate course in classical mechanics. From my experience, using Landau several times to teach such a course, is that it makes an EXCELLENT textbook which is a joy to teach from. The one thing that it lacks is unworked exercises that may be assigned as homework. It's not difficult to create suitable exercises; I would be happy to share my collection (including solutions) with other instructors."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kindle Edition of this Great Book is Scandalously Produced","review":"This book is of course one of the great classics of modern physics.

But if you want a movie that isn't a fairy take, and one that forces you to think, Sweet Sixteen is a good choice.I see no reason this film shouldn't have been made. I don't think Sweet Sixteen's purpose is to introduce or represent Scottish culture. It's about a youth, Liam, facing the dissapointments of life, and how cruel life can be.It also is not heart-warming, and it was misleading for the packaging to include that word.In Sweet Sixteen, I found myself hoping that once Liam's mother came out of prison that his life would get better: instead, the dissapointments kept coming.

The other one died before twenty charges.So I got these two and I'll be darned if these XRP's didn't die out on me within a few months. I took one of them to a battery store but the cost was too high to replace the sub c cells in it and the lady there told me that two were fried and that it is a common fault with these type of batteries.I'm going to sell my Dewalt stuff and get some other brand that comes with decent batteries.

I have had a Skill battery power drill with the original batteries that lasted close to 6 years and cost a fraction of the Dewalt setup. The cost of replacement batteries is outrageous in my opinion. So here is the choice you get faced with either spend another $100 bucks on new batteries or chunk the drill and go to another brand.DeWalt is a big name brand but the quality of the product i bought was very poor.I am sure there are thousands of very satisfied customers out there at a heavy price tag but I am sure there are those of who feel they have gotten their shorts burned off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short life batteries","review":"I bought a DeWalt kit 4 months ago from Lowe's and the batteries are gone already.

I've got a Dewalt anniversary edition 12v silver drill. That battery has worked very well for 2 years plus and is OK. The 18 volt battery 2.4 amp hour rating is just average. You can buy a Sears 19.2 volt system for the price of 2 Dewalt batterys, get more juice and all new tools. My Dewalt 18v tools are going in the garbage. These batterys should cost no more than $30 and that's too high. Just a plain rip off. The old razor and razor blade deal. The blades are the battery.

But the sensual Catwoman absolutley steals the show moving like a cat, purring seductively, and (gasp) licking herself clean!! Wow. She is worth the super low price of this priceless DVD alone.

Adam West and Burt Ward make an excellent commentary poking fun at themselves. Easily, the commentary is as entertaining as the film itself! Bamf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman! Batman! Batman!: My first childhood hero.","review":"This is probably the best batman movie for all true Batfans. The original characters played by Adam West and Burt Ward are at their finest.

When this first was released in the theatres in 1966, I was a 5 year old Batman obsessed kid. I remember my wonderful twin great aunts taking me to the movies to see this cheese-fest. While it's no technical marvel, it is a very fun addition to the 60's TV show era of the Batman legacy. And for just a few dollars, it's well worth re-living the the memories associated with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"Batman: The Movie is an excellent film. Must probably one of the best movies I have seen. Don't fall for all these dumb animated Batman movies, get the ORIGINAL. The story starts off where The Joker, The Penguin, The Riddler, and The Catwoman, join forces together to conquer Gotham City. They then steal a dehydration gun and kidnap the UN Security Council.

This movie sucks!","review":"I'm not even sure where to begin about this god-awful nightmare of a movie.All I can really say is that,that is a TOTAL disgrace to Batman's name and character.Since when does Batman fight crime in the daytime? Kinda defeats the whole purpose of being the \\"dark knight\\" doesn't it? And Boy Wonder Robin is just a high school nerd in tights.Complete Camp Crap...just like the 60's show.Any TRUE Batman fan would hate this as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ha ha! It's funny!","review":"This film was the dumbest thing since alien pops with cheese, but I loved it! \\"Wham! Bap! Zang!\\" were constantly being showed in combat scenes.

Though it looks cheesy by todays standards, that's really what they were shooting for back in 1966. I loved the bonus features and especially the commentary by Adam West and Burt Ward who let the viewers know that they also were'nt taking this seriously. My favorite is when Batman and Robin are trying to separate the dehydrated dust and are wearing doctors masks and aprons and Adam West says \\"look at these two idiots.\\" Also if the execs at Fox are reading these reviews, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE ON HANDS AND KNEES, release the show on DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman The Movie","review":"I watched this series as a kid.

Buy it for the memories, treasure its foolishness, and be a kid again. (And the sad part is, it's still better than most of the pathetic films in theaters today that AREN'T aware of just how awful they really are.)P.S. The greatest line Bats has ever uttered... \\"Quick, Robin!

All the interviews are from the last release. The only difference is the packaging ! All the interviews mention the 35th anniversary of Batman the series but we are now at a 42 year anniversary. Its a great movie with wonderful extras but it would have been nice of Fox to add a little something extra since they re-released this disc. If you own the 2001 edition as I do you will be disapointed spending more money for a package with a red bat. Well I guess that is one way for Fox to ride the coat tails of Warner Bros pending the new Dark Knight movie.Do not waste your money on this edition if you have the 2001 edition !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blast from the past","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old son after he would see it playing at the comic book store.

Great for entertaining kids and on the adult side (aside from the ambiguously gay relationship between Bruce Wayne and \\"ward\\" turned boytoy Dick Grayson) the Catwoman is adorable, especially in her turn as a faux James Bond-esque Russian hotsty-totsy reporter romancing Bruce Wayne. But my God, Shatner didn't have as many dramatic pauses!And what was up with marking the Bat Ladder \\"Bat Ladder\\"? I realize this was before \\"Jaws,\\" but if you're going to have a shark attack, don't have it with an obviously fake shark.In the interest of full disclosure I was never fond of the original Batman series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holy ... Batman! This movie is ...!","review":"I LOVED this movie when I was a little kid. I must have watched it a million times. And I was a big fan of the TV show too. Now, years later and I'm an adult, watching this movie is very painful. I'm sorry but it's just terrible. Adam West has got to be the worst actor in the history of the world. He was a horrible Batman! Even worse than George Clooney! He could have used some time at the gym too. That pot belly does not make Batman look too powerful. Burt Ward is a great Robin when his mouth is closed. He looks great but his dialog is just annoying. The Joker, Penguin and Catwoman were all stupid. I loved the Riddler though. My God, who wrote this script? Super villains get together to turn the world leaders into sand? Even with them gone the world seems to run just fine. It doesn't do any good to question the storyline in this movie. It's best to just not watch it. Adam West was by far the worst part about the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Na na na na na na na na na na na na na BatMan.","review":"Way better than Micheal Keaton, Val Kilmer, or George Clooney.

It was the TV version made for the wide screen, and TV in the sixties was B-A-D. This is not an attempt to be serious, and it shows. And what's wrong with that? The idea was to have fun, and this is fun. Just like a lot of B-movies, the poor attempts to be serious or scary are funny! That's the charm of this movie.

Marilyn Manson is truly a unique one-of-a-kind artist and it shows! Starting with Coma White, the videos begin with the most recent in 1999, including Long Hard Road Out of Hell (an awesome song and video), The Beautiful People, Sweet Dreams, and ending with Dope Hat (humorous video), and Lunch Box (always a Manson classic). Then you are treated to concert footage and some backstage antics. Marilyn's parents even make a cameo in support, as always, of their son. There is also a few clips of signs that some anti-Manson groups made. They really show what hypocrits they are. (When you see these signs keep in mind that Christians are not supposed to pass judgement on others.) If you are truly a Manson fan then you should already know what he is about, therefore nothing on this video should be a surprise. It is really a very fun and enjoyable time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Manson fan","review":"God is in the TV contains all of Marilyn Manson's music videos (up until 1999) and a collection of concert footage and behind the scenes shenanigans. Starting off with the excellent video for \\"Coma White\\" (which features Manson and then love Rose McGowen) and moving it's way backwards through the years as an almost de-evolution of Manson and his band. The standout videos are \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" (from the Spawn soundtrack), \\"Man That You Fear\\", and the classic \\"Lunchbox\\". After the videos we are treated to some live segments from the \\"Rock is Dead\\" tour, plus some backstage shenanigans that are nothing short of disturbing, disgusting, and hilarious.

It starts off with his melodic, tearfull JFK video, \\"coma white\\"; diminishing any sick shock rock steriotype thoughts you might have of him rite from the start. Some of the others are \\"dont like the drugs\\", \\"the dope show\\", \\"the man that you fear\\", and also some originals from 1989 through the early 90's like \\"get your gunn\\", lunchbox\\", and \\"sweet dreams\\".It also has some great live footage, some quite x-rated.

Part one is an introduction on the subject and part two is a guide to intercessory prayer breaking down insights from Paul's letters. The book will be a blessing for both personal and group study. Part two is presented in such a way as to guide believers in monthly focus - twelve specific meditations (one for each month of the year)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title misleading","review":"The book's title is misleading. It's a study of 20th century New England Gothic literature, and a romp through various items of New England folklore from the 17th through the 19th century with very little of value in terms of literary criticism.

The whole point of having Julia Roberts in Mongolia is that while she is a \\"star,\\" she isn't any better acclimated to life there than any other American. So we get to see Mongolia through her eyes as we would probably experience it ourselves.

A wonderful mixture of down-home blues, neo-psychedelic instrumentals, and great soft-rock songs by Jorma Kaukonen. \\"Keep On Truckin'\\" and \\"Water Song\\" really stand out. The reviewer who called this album \\"tired blues\\" must be some kind of nerd who enjoys panning CDs that he hasn't really listened to. The guitar/bass/drums interaction is some of the best ever recorded. Throw in some cookin' electric fiddle by Papa John Creach and this band attains a musical nirvana unmatched by any of their other albums.( The first album, \\"Hot Tuna\\" is also a classic but it's just acoustic guitar and bass.) \\"Burgers\\" is great cruisin' music and great tokin' music that sounds as good today as it did when it was released in 1972."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all time favorite","review":"This one goes back to 73 for me. One of those records that always found its way to the turntable. I started listening to Hot Tuna on the first album when Jorma first started things off. It all came together when Papa John Creach and Jack Cassady joined in to make things more interesting on this record, their third effort I believe. This music is soft to the ear but packs a sharp edge. Burgers combines elements of rock, folk and jazz into a very wonderful listening experience"},{"rating":"2","title":"none","review":"I like this album because of all the guest artists that played onit and if you are a Hot Tuna fan this album is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Unfunny...","review":"I heard great things about Barbershop 2. The first is alright, but this movie starts nowhere and goes nowhere.The only good character is really Cedric, and they show alot of him through flashbacks(just like Memento). As for the others, they aren't anything special. I didn't laugh at any of the commercials and this movie didn't make me laugh once. The only real saving grace is that they did not choose annoying actors for the lead rolls.I would call this movie a cash-in, but that's not what this is. This movie is simply not well done, and isn't funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"okay>? what happened>?","review":"the barbershop series is kind of a downgrade.... the first one was HI-larious.... th second one was kind of a lackluster.... no funny funny like the first movie.... i dont blame the cast one bit, it is america and how offended people can get... people in america take things way too serious....its a movie it is not real!!! they are all jokes.... that is what happend to the 2nd movie they tried to keep it tame... i could see if the movies switched places but it did not happen.the funniest parts actually came from kenan thompson (from kenan and kel on nickelodeon and SNL) he was mad funny.... AND queen latifah. the only part in the movie i was looking forward to was the bar-b-que when queen latifah and cedric the entertainer's characters . they could have ranaway with that scene and made the movie a classic but that scene was way weak...if you have not seen the 2nd movie DO NOT expect anything more than brady bunch humour..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Average","review":"This movie is nothing special, Barbershop 1 was way better.

Maybe this is the cutting room material removed from the floor during Barbershop 1. The new high-tech spa style barbershop storyline wasn't that great.

When Eddie finally ran into the mystery woman after 30 or 40 yrs later at the subway/train/loop, the directors didn't take the story any further.

However it still lacks in other areas, such as a poor, sudden, conclusion; and a slow start.The storyline of this movie is fairly close to that of the original. One of the last mainstays of Americana, the corner barbershop, is being threatened by big developers who want to put a chain store across the street. Barbershop 2, however, is less about the story and more about the characters. And the characters are truly larger then life. You will fall in love with each of them and their idiosyncracies. They all return from the original, and that's the main reason this move gets an above average review.It started slow but quickly picked up steam. I was suprised by the sudden ending, however, and would have preferred that it continue for at least another ten minutes. Overall, though, a good movie well worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This and the first movie are on the same level to me.

Now I must admit that I had to give up reading half way through the book, I just couldn't take it anymore. I am a huge sci fi fan and read a large number of books every year, and it is fairly rare for me not to be able to finish a book. It started out boring on page 1, and went down hill from there. If it wasn't for the little story blurb on Amazon I probably wouldn't even know what was going on at all in the story. Maybe it got better in the second half, but even the Supreme Court would consider it cruel and inhuman punishment to make someone read it to get there. I really can't give you an intellectual analysis of the book, because I have no idea where it began of where it was going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah!

Now I try to avoid watching the more recent SpongeBob SquarePants episodes because just knowing that the earlier episodes were better kills their quality even more for me.

In fact, one can make a nice trilogy out of PREFACE TO PARADISE LOST, PARADISE LOST, and Lewis's PERELANDRA. Lewis's PREFACE should interest both the general reader and the specialist. Lewis gives a roadmap for working through Milton's epic poem, discussing what an epic is and why Milton chose it, for example, or why Milton used a certain style for writing; he also comments on Milton's theology, medieval hierarchy, and a number of other pertinent subjects with which the reader will probably not be overly familiar. The writing is clear, the discussion lucid and enlightening, and the subjects are interesting. This is certainly worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sense Does Not Grow Old","review":"Lewis's lectures, though half a century old, speak today with the same clarity, simplicity, and depth of learning as when they were first delivered. His presentation of background information sets the great English epic in its contemporary context--literary, historical, and theological--with a minimum of fuss and footnotes. Some of his negative judgments, such as calling the last two books \\"an undigested lump of futurity,\\" deserve reconsideration, but on the whole his judgments encourage critical reading rather than bardolatry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep, insightful analysis by a brilliant apologeticist.","review":"Read this before reading Paradise Lost for a much easier time comprehending the work. Lewis is recognized by most literary scholars for his ability to interpret the language and literature from the Milton's period in literary history. It is clear, easy to read, yet profound in insight. Any reader who is honestly interested in comprehending the depth of Milton's work will appreciate Lewis' analysis; unless, of course, that reader is such a defensive unbeliever that he cannot stomach the idea that the devil might be real, even in literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"midsomer mayhem","review":"Who doe's not love a classy murder and only Barnaby can keep the class in mayhem can't wait for 17"},{"rating":"2","title":"Midsomer Murders","review":"As with the 15 sets prior an enjoyable, relaxing and entertaining series.

The fiber optic lights up like search beacon and your eyes are automatically drawn exactly where they should be; to the front sight! You pick up the sights quicker, you pick up the target quicker, and consequently your rounds are down range faster and more accurately, as long as you do your part behind the gun. Al the light bars work well, but I chose the red fiber optic on mine. Installation was under 10 seconds and unless you use your gun as substitute for a hammer they should last various lifetimes.

Its not a $100 tritium night sight, all it does is capture ambient light and reflect it to make your front sight easier to acquire. You still won't see it in complete darkness, but compared to the stock black sight blade that rulers ship with, this is 1000 times better. I like it enough that I ordered another for my 2nd GP100.This item also comes with a little carrying case for storing the spare rods (yellow, white, green, red, etc) and a small tool for changing the rods (no directions but its pretty apparent how it works if you look at the sight). Just slide the tool between the sight body and the rod and use one of the spare rods to push the rod out of the sight housing. To instal the new rod just slide it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night and Day","review":"This sight is a great deal considering how expensive other options are. Even in low light conditions I can still easily acquire my front sight for a sure shot. I could not be happier with this addition to my GP-100.The installation took under a minute and was simple.

The wind machine in \\"Cloudburst\\" does slightly drown out some orchestral detail, but nothing major. In the \\"Bachianas\\" Brazilian folk melodies abound and theres use of some effective saxaphone and trombone. The famousfinale \\"Little Train\\"(performed as an encore in many a concert)comes chugging through your speakers.

Plain and simple, the tracks on this CD are either very boring and/or very cheesy. (with the exception of Ogenki Clinic's \\"First Light\\" - and he makes you wait til the end of the first CD to hear it!) Max Graham's own \\"Tell You\\" is the cheesiest thing I've heard since Perfecto's \\"Bullet In a Gun\\" - which is PRECISELY where I stopped listening to Paul Oakenfold! Go buy Sander Kleinenberg's \\"Nu Breed\\" or Hooj's \\"New Progressive Era\\". Those CD'S are way cool and dairy free! And by the way, Max Graham, this is exactly why some DJ's are starting to play \\"too deep\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible - I wasted my money","review":"I went on a spree a couple of weeks ago - buying a couple dozen trance/progressive CDs.

Enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate trance","review":"It takes a REALLY good DJ like John Digweed to make Trance listenable. From what I've heard about Max Graham, I'd have thought he could do better than this. Two CDs of pure boring trance drivel. The tracklist grabbed me because he rounds out disc 2 with Underworld's unbelievable \\"Kittens.\\" However, it embarrassingly crushes the tracks on either side of it (and everything else in the set). You'd be better off just getting UW's Beaucoup Fish, which contains the exact same version of \\"Kittens\\" in all its glory, without crappy tracks blended into it. If you are looking for superb progressive trance, go get Digweed's Global Underground Los Angeles. Both discs are the BOMB. Seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful....","review":"First of all, let me say that I hate this album. I really hate this album. P>It's not trance, it's progressive. Which is why they had to rename the cd series. (Why they just couldn't start a new series is beyond me...). That's not a problem, even though I hate progressive as much as I hate techno. The trouble is, it's awful, uninspired, bad progressive (instead of the typical just boring and dull progressive), coupled with horrible DJing.If you want progressive stuff done right, get Digweeds's recent albums. It's boring, too, but at least it's well done. Or Sandra Collins' pre-tranceport stuff. This is just awful. (If you want actual trance, get Suzy Solar's Perfect Trance...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant surprise","review":"I picked up Tranceport, err... Transport 4 on a whim, based mainly on the reputation of the series and my liking of \\"Airtight\\", \\"Bar None\\", and other Max Graham hits. Much to my surprise, this is by far the best album in the series since Oakey's groundbreaking debut. At first, I believed CD2 to be the superior mix, but CD1 grew on me. Highlights are Hybrid - \\"High Life\\" and Max Graham - \\"Tell You\\". This CD is a must-have for any trance fan, the builds will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid.","review":"I got a presale of this CD before it came out. I was a little hesitant at first because I didn't recognize the name. CD1 is subtle but get's ya, kinda like the first cd of Digweed's Bedrock. CD2 blew me out of the water. It starts out hard, and keeps pumpin. Im hoping I will be able to see him live soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is a great CD, no doubt about it. Don't listen to anyone who says differently... There is not an ounce of cheese in this thing, the mixing is competent and often brilliant, the tracks are shweet. Personally I find it to be a little bit too mellow in some parts, a lot like the Balance Promotions chart listing which is good solid music but the whole \\"simmer but don't boil\\" philosophy of track selections can leave me wanting more sometimes. But this criticism is about taste only. In terms of technique Max Graham is up there with the very best. If you like trace then you need to have this CD in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Epic","review":"This is by FAR the best entry in the Traceport series. Max takes expertly guides listeners through bouncy bass house (i.e. Too Heavy & The Nelson Effect), driving Techno (i.e. Turned & Shoreline), melodic Progressive (i.e. Sudden Journey & Vogue), and uplifting Trance (i.e. Vernon's Wonderland & Redemption).Standout tracks for me are:Greed Feat. Leslie - Strange World (Blackwatch 'King Monkey Dub')Sugarglider - Slow Motion (Van Bellen Remix)Veron's Wonderland - Veron's Wonderland (Hybrid's Matrix Dub)Max Graham - Tell YouMax Graham - ShorelineAyumi Hamasaki _ Vogue (Computerhell Vocal Mix)Hybrid _ High Life (Live Version)Underworld - KittensConjure One - Redemption (Max Graham Dead Sea Mix)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Transporting ye to the other side","review":"This has to be one of the best progressive trance cd's i have heard up to now....it's been a year already and still this remains one of my favorite trance cd's....Max Graham goes to the max with his progressive house meets progressive trance Transport 4 installment.....Starting from a deep perspective he creeps his way up to deep house and then to progressive trance on disc 1 while on disc 2 he starts off immediately with progressive and pushes it to the limit....truly a classic release!!!...(And if ye like this one ye also have to check out Bedrock Compiled & Mixed by Jimmy van M)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very generic and forgettable","review":"As someone who listens primarily to electronica and thinks Max Graham has produced some excellent remixes/tracks, I thought I would love this album. Unfortunately I would characterize most selections as boring, uncreative, and forgettable. Sure there are a few neat tracks, like the slickly produced and slightly sinister remix of Conjure One's Redemption, but there is not enough material here for one CD, let alone two.This album is not recommended unless you desire some background music that does not draw your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"The new CD in the Tranceport series is dire. In a market where innovative progressive house/trance mix CDs are released every week, this new complilation does nothing to stand up to the competition and is positively dull. Although well mixed, there is nothing groundreaking here. If you're expecting an exciting musical journey, then don't bother buying this. You would be better off playing with your own organ!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The up and coming Max Graham","review":"Max Graham is not a household name yet, but his time will come when he will be in the likes of Oakenfold, Digweed, Sasha, Van Dyk, etc. This album truely defines trance to its purest form. It takes the elements of early trance and blends in with modern sound and you get this album. The mixing of Max Graham is unbelievable. Stealthy, sneaky, and jumps on you before you realize it. His selections are carefully thought out and portrays mixed emotions of bliss and sorrow. He reveals this sound in about the middle of the first cd. Max manages to bring the hard sound of Strange World and morphs it into the dreamy and fantasy-like sound of Sugarglider's Slow Motion, then transforms that into the dark Sudden Journey. People are used to commercialized and club trance, and probably wouldnt recognize this as a great album. But true fans of electronic music know that this guy is someone to watch out for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb...","review":"The best trance compilation I've ever heard was made a few years ago by a DJ friend of mine from NYC, TN Steel. Max Graham's Transport 4 is a damn close second!Transport 4 is pure electronic bliss. As someone who likes PVD and other mainstream DJs, perhaps it's no surprise that I would like Graham. However, it seemed there was no place for trance DJs to go. Transport 4 disproves this many times over. The tracks on the CD are fresh, pulsing, clean...perfect! It's almost like he opened a time capsule from a few years back and pulled out the best of trance when it was it its height.The point is: THIS CD IS AMAZING...and well worth your Euros, dollars or yen. Max Graham's \\"Tell You\\" (track 10, disc 1) makes the CD worthwhile by itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your ordinary trance, but excellent","review":"First of all, if you're looking for that sickly-sweet trance reminiscent of ATC or other overrated junk like that, this is not your album. Max mixed a cd of very good music, but it's not the typical trance that's been bouncing around clubs lately. That said, the cd is excellent. The tracks are all mixed well, with the obvious highlights being Max's own tracks, Conjure One's \\"Redemption\\" and \\"Tell You\\". They aren't your typical euphoric, hands-in-the-air trance anthems, more like trance by default, but they're very good, mainly because of the fact that there's nothing out there like it at all. Max brings a freshness to the \\"Tranceport\\" series which definitely is on a par with the previous releases in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas classics","review":"Santa's Top 10 is a pretty good collection of ten Christmas classics.

We will hurt right alone with William Bell as he admits that he did not do what was necessary to keep his woman in \\"I Forgot To Be Your Lover.\\" Mel and Tim were luckey: They got the chance to be \\"Starting All Over Again.\\" We will feel btter about the world once we know that there is a peaceful place where there are no smiling faces or lyng to the races as in \\"I'll Take You There\\" by the Staple Singers.

It looks like you would expect a movie to look like these days. The plot however was fairly obvious; it's likened to the plot line of the movie \\"Crash\\" where people are related based on a series of events both past and present. The movie started out by relating to events that was 1 year earlier so It's understandable that the main protagonist was reflecting. However as the other characters started reflecting also (i.e. within the reflection of the main protagonist) it was very hard to keep track of what was present day and what was in the past, and past past. Character development was terrible, and some of the acting seemed unnatural. I should have lowered my expectations before looking at the film, however so this review is most likely biased.

There are some nice twists and small surprises but overall, the movie is very slow. It may have made a good made-for-tv movie with the commercials breaking up the boring story.Having said that, I AM was made to show to non-Christians.

It relies heavily on research conducted in the 1980s and 1990s --these \\"adolescents and emerging adults\\" are now in their 40s and 50s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Student Review","review":"I recieved this item quite quickly and just in time for class and amazingly I enjoyed the book as much as a student can possibly enjoy a textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like fiberLESS","review":"I got this product to take along with my total body cleanse because it's made by the same company, and I had heard it is good to get more fiber, especially when detoxing, so as to help absorb the toxins. When I got home, however, after taking fiberSMART for a few days I was looking more closely at the Supplement Facts on the back of the bottle. Truth is this product only contains 1g of fiber per 4 capsules. So even if you take the 12 capsules per day, you're only actually getting 3g of fiber. WTF!? Just eat a slice of bread and you'll get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had know just how little fiber is in this product","review":"There are .25g of fiber in one pill and the recommended dose is 4 to 8 pills a day. That is a lot of pills and it only adds up to a whopping 2g of fiber. I took these 8 pills a day for two weeks with no benefit. It was only then I examined the ingredients more carefully. .25g per pill?! Preposterous. This product did not help me to go or to become more regular and at $14 I am more than annoyed that the description did not include the amount of fiber that is actually in the product. If I had read the fiber content on the bottle when it arrived I would have just sent it back. Silly me. I skipped right over it to the other ingredients. If you eat a piece of flax bread and a cup of yogurt every day you will pretty much have achieved what this product does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"I love this movie.

The language is explained only incidentally, and in very little detail. the book mostly concentrates on computer graphics theory (which is done much better in other books) and visualisation, which it treats fairly well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands Off","review":"This is clearly one of the worst books I've ever seen. I do admit there's lots of detail in there on visualization techniques etc. However, buying a book named \\"The Visualization Toolkit\\" I expect information about exactly this. Instead, what you get with this book is in-depth coverage of how the marching cubes algorithm works for example. Now let me ask you: Does that information help you using the toolkit? Definitely not. Consequently, if you want a practical guide to using VTK, do NOT consider this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shakespeare wasn't made for T.V.","review":"I liked this movie,and I agree Miranda is a hottie. I don't feel that this movie did justice to Shakespeare. I mean you take a play written by the greatest writter in history and turn into a made for T.V. movie? Come on, whose Idea was this? I did like the special effects. I wonder what Shakespeare would have done if he were alive today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespearean?","review":"Overall the movie was a good movie. But if your'e going to steel Shakespear's play, then you must make the movie exactly the same. Otherwise the movie looses it's intrigue. The characters acted out their parts efficiently, but not extrordinarily. This was certainly not the best movie I have ever seen. It just takes too much away from the legendary play, The Tempest, by Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Film Insults My Intelligence","review":"I was, no, I am deeply disappointed in this film. Who said that just because a movie is \\"made for TV\\" it is allowed to completely eliminate all acting skill, story line, and meaningful plot elements? This film is a hodgepodge of ideas taken from the story, trying desperately to cling together to form a plot. I have read The Tempest, it was good. I watched this movie, it was not. The only way that this movie could redeem itself would be if it were on Mystery Science Theatre 3000. It takes chutzpah to put your name on a film like this. Peter Fonda should run for president with nerves like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Tempest is Trash","review":"The movie The Tempest with Peter Fonda completely failed to display the quality and meaning of Shakespeare's play. The whole mystical feel of Shakespeare's play was lost. The setting of the story made no sense. The actors were terrible and the civil war did not fit in. All in all I wouldn't ever recomend this movie to anyone. To put anyone through that torture is cruel and unusually punishment. If you want a good and meaningfull story read Shakespeare's play."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live albums ever","review":"Buy it! Don't think twice; it's better than alright.

The latter is the case w/ this book. To be quite honest, I just never really cared about these characters. Actually, I'm still trying to force myself to finish it. The story line was just okay too. I don't know what made anyone give this more than a 3 star at the most. I have read two other books by her, Morning Glory and The Endearment. They were both very good. This was just okay.

This movie has almost all aspects of both the good and bad of life, love, hate, rape, hope, murder, tragic accidents, everything. It's well worth seeing for all the performances, not just Colin Farre's, although he did do an excellent job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Romantic","review":"Wonderful period drama/romance. It reminded me of Far From the Madding Crowd mixed with a dash of Pride & Prejudice - all set in rural early 20th Century Ireland. Mossie Sheehan is every inch the devoted Gabriel Oak; and when he hunts down and returns the silly step-daughter who has run off with a lover, it's reminiscent of Darcy's search and delivery of Lydia. That said, it isn't a five-star series. The wigs are horrific. Elizabeth settles a little too easily and quickly into the role of mother (particularly to another woman's children) and adjusts a little too happily into rural life for a woman who was raised in the city as solicitor's daughter. But all faults are forgiven on my part when Mossie Sheehan declares his love - twice (sort of). My knees buckled and I had to get a drink of water to recover my senses. All in all, the most romantic series I've seen in a long while (not counting Gaskell's incomparable North & South). You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"First disk wouldn't play","review":"The rating system above doesn't accurately convey my problem I don't know what the film was like, as I couldn't play the first disk. The second was okay, it was just the first, and on closer inspection of the disk, it had some sort of ingrain stain over across the surface of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad story yet a good movie","review":"I have watched this movie twice and found it to be one which can make you want to cry and be heartsick for all concerned. The young lady has found herself in a position to where she has to make the best out of what is to say \\"sad\\". She loved an actor, got pregnant, married an older man, fell for a younger man, and then the story becomes sadder, then turns out for the best, depending on how you think of the other man. You will become hopeful for the young lady that she finds rebirth in romance with someone who can give her true love. She has a good heart, yet is misled in some ways. It's a true to life situation for the Irish countryside. I enjoyed the movie, yet wanted her to be able to spread her wings and live life with the man she finds to be her love mate. It's a different story and one you will think about. You will be glad you watched the entire story from beginning to end. A 4 star movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could be!","review":"This is a nice story with lots of dramatic scenery but it is full of inconsistencies that really ruin the movie. The main character's hair is short, then in scenes that happen a day or two later it is very long, then the next day it is short again. When one person gets buried in the graveyard, it is located downhill by the water. When another person gets buried in the same graveyard, it is up on top of a hill. It is very hard to concentrate on the plot, characters, etc. when this is happening all the time.

I have paid a lot for a heater just to have them die after only a few weeks of use. Well, this one failed right out of the box. No matter how much I adjusted the temperature it would not turn off.

But now its a little bit colder in my house and I have it set at 82 degrees and its struggling to keep my tank at 76 degrees. This shouldn't be a problem cause its rated for a 35 to 55 gallon tank and I have a 30 gallon. I bought the bigger heater knowing that the room the tank is located averages about 60 degrees in the winter.Plus the design is weird its a long skinny tube that has to be submersed in the water. Then on top it has a blue plastic ball the sized of a golf ball. I'm assuming that part cannot get wet because the instructions say do not get the electrical components wet. SO ITS NOT FULLY SUBMERSIBLE. But that weird design of a ball on the end makes it so I have to position the whole thing below the lip of my tank which means I cant fill my tank up all the way. If i position it outside of my tank then the water in my tank won't reach the minimum water level mark on the heater."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD LOOKING FIGURE","review":"I'm not sure what the deal is with the reviews below.

The figure is a very nicely painted likeness of the character. The paint job shows nice facial shading and tones. It's better than the Power of the Jedi Figure.

I know that depth is a key element to 3D, but this video had too much inward depth and not enough OUTWARD depth. It works both ways!From now on, my official 3D Blu-ray review ratings will consist of 1 star maximum for content and 4 starts for 3D quality (1 being very poor, 2: fair, 3: good, 4: excellent).

They came heavy with the club bangers in the beginning and smoothed it out in the end. The interludes were on point especially \\"Q,Mike,Slim,Daron\\" they killed it. Mike put his heart and soul on \\"Missing You\\" whoever was his girl definitely hit a chord. \\"Dont Be Mad\\" feat. Twista was definitely bout it with 112 talking about handling another dude's girl. That was a bold song. All the members really shined on this album as far as lead vocals, producing. You really see these gentlemen coming into their craft. Just wish they were still on Bad Boy because they fell off since they went to Def Jam. Good Luck in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"really 4.8 stars","review":"man oh man these guys sure can sing i just love their voices they blend nicely my favorite songs would have to be Dance with me,peaches and cream its over now,dont hate me featuring twista,caught up and do what you gotta do what you gotta is buy this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight CD","review":"This CD is hot.

I'm a professional club DJ, I have 2000 or so CD's. I listen to everything in the world except country in my spare time, and I have to say, If you're looking for hip-hop/new soul/R & B, skip past this CD.This group is slick, like an overly produced and sound engineered product. They produce hooky spineless pop, not R & B. They're no more R & B then J. Lo is Latin music.

I think this CD is a combination of all of them and is preety much the best CD ever! The first time I heard this CD i fell in love with it! My favorite songs are Dance with Me and Peaches and Cream. But now...my favorite song is Smile. It is soo sweet. I can listen to the entire CD 100x or rather 112x and still keep listening! I liked their other CDs too, but it cant compare with Part III. Anyway I know I've talked enough...bottom line is BUY THIS CD YOU WONT REGRET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Times a charm","review":"This is 112's best cd to date. There are a couple of songs that shouldn't of been put on but its alright. The best track on here is #13, don't get caught up. I hope this gets released soon because its definitely a hit. This cd has a great variety of beats and is definitely worth buying and adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"They mature a lot in this cd.

Everything fits well if you pack properly. The quality is solid and it's built very well. The only 2 complaints I have are as follows:- The leather gets worn around the edges but I think that's to be expected with as much use as I put it through- Where the strap attaches to the bag (metal hooks and eyelets) it makes a very annoying squeaking sound when I walk. It's happened since day one, I've yet to try to fix it though, it may be simple.All in all, it's a solid bag for the price - you couldn't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trip, LONG ride.","review":"My only complaint about this book is its lack of brevity.(I should stop here to make my point, right?)I prefer my hard core intellectual concepts handed to me in bite-sized pieces. Easy to digest. Piaget uses every word in his thesaurus to deliver the most trivial of thoughts. Its a hard read for the average brain.Having said that, Piaget's ideas are solid and have provided this reader a brilliant look into the inner workings of the mind. He explains the how and why of the motives of thought, learning, emotions and an organism's interaction with the world around it.His discussion of \\"perturbances to the equilibrium of an organism's environment\\", ...\\"cause a weighted reaction in an effort to restore balance...\\" is fascinating.I read this book in the late 70's while studying psychology. I've read it again in recent days because I now work with artificial intelligence - Piaget's fundamentals are as solid today as they were long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent value","review":"I purchased this item as a required textbook for a class on cognitive development and education.

A little shampoo goes a long way, it foams very well, and has a thick consistency (not watered down like most cheap shampoos). I love it. It may not help my hair color, but I will keep using it for the quality.It also smells nice, nothing too strong or particular, but it's pleasing. Is also agreeable for guys, because it doesn't smell too feminine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obtuse and too often scanty","review":"The primary feature of Askeland's text is in the speed with which its sections can be read. Unfortunately, this is due to the lack of necessary detail. Difficult concepts are often glossed over, while simpler topics receive undue attention. The example problems don't seem as relevant as they might be, and certainly bear more strongly on the author's skills than on the student's.I may be unfairly comparing this book with Callister's \\"Materials Science and Engineering,\\" but given the choice of either as a reference source, I would hesitate to choose Askeland. If you are stuck with the Askeland text for a course, but really need to understand material behavior, then invest in the Callister book as a backup - it will greatly enhance your understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Understand","review":"The text starts with an introduction to crystal structures that is needlessly complicated and do not give the student any sort of explanation as to how crystal structures relate to the topics dicussed later in the text. The questions at the end of each chapter are considerably more difficult than the sample problems in the chapter, making it very tough to learn from if the student is trying to learn solely from the book. Orange highlights are hard to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still searching for answers","review":"This text is written in a reasonably straight forward style that simplifies understanding some of the concepts explained. I especially enjoyed the chapters on solidification strengthening and polymers.I did have a difficult time finding specific subjects using the index. Compared to the volume of subject matter the index is very small, with typically only 1 referenced page per item. There are several subjects that are explained several different ways, but to find each explanation requires searching through the chapters. this make the book less useful for reading desired material.In general this is an acceptable text book and would be useful for introductory materials classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Read - Poor Presentation","review":"The material is presented as if you already have a strong chemical background. What information is there stops short of explaining it in any type of useful manner. It certainly is not practical information. I purchased it as a Supplier Quality Engineer of Gray Iron Castings and walked away with little that I could use in the REAL world. Metallurgists that I work with confirmed this. The professor of the college course in Material Science discontinued using this book because his student were walking away with very little and he was only referring to this $180 book sporadically as to not confuse the students. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indications of Poor Quality","review":"Inside Front Cover: The characteristic exponent of ten for the speed of light, c, should be +8 or 8 and not -8. For the Fe-C phase diagram the labels of 'steel'and 'cast iron' on the %carbon-x-axis are reversed in position from what they should be. Polymer Chapter: 'PET' usually stands for poly-ethylene-terephthalate and not poly-ester although the first is maybe a type of the second. This might be a matter of different diciplines but 'PAN' here is said to mean poly-acrylic-nitrile while in the environmental field it means peroxy-acetyl-nitrate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for a general introduction to materials","review":"The book contains all the information you need to know on materials. Information is provided in a well-organized format that readers will understand the materials structure, processing and property relationships. Although the book tend to focus on mostly metal-alloy, polymers, ceramics, composite and electronics materials were also included. The book is very good reference book for anybody who are involved with materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 3 year olds!","review":"To easy (and slow) for 5 year olds, but perfect for 2.5 to 4 year olds. This game would also work for kids who are first learning how to use the computer. At 3 they love the fact that Steve talks alot, and that the game moves at a much slower pace. The wonderful thing about the game is the complexity of the story, and how many levels there are. I think of all the games that my two boys have played this one still sits near the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"My 5 year old son loves to watch the Blue's Clues TV show, and we have the Blue's Clues Treasure Hunt movie. But the computer game leaves a lot to be desired. When you first start the game, Steve does a lot of talking - so much so that my son asked, \\"Is all we get to do is watch?\\". Finally we get started, but there is still too much waiting in the game - waiting for Steve to talk, or catch up. Also, when you are doing the activities, you don't know how long you have to do them to earn the clue. Finally you quit the activity in frustration, and there's the clue waiting for you. After this happened a couple of times, we realized we can do the activity as long (or as short) as you want, and still get the clue.We enjoyed playing going on the treasure hunt, but at times we shut down the game because we were frustrated and didn't want to wait any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not very good","review":"Queenan is obviously a smart guy but doesn't get very far here. The best parts are when he's shooting fish in a barrel (Kenny G, John Tesh, Cats..but honestly who needs to be told this is bad). However, his take on pop music is completely clueless. The Billy Joel section is typical. An entire chapter goes by of listing songs that he thinks are bad... and not a shred of rhyme or reason. He seems to be entirely concentrating on the lyrics and ignoring the fact that in popular songs the music is what matters. The reason Billy Joel, Elton John and ABBA are popular is that they have written lots of catchy memorable melodies. If there's something wrong with that Queenan hasn't revealed it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witless","review":"I cannot imagine spending an evening with this man. I'm reminded of a roommate I once had who, after arriving home, complained about the traffic for 30 minutes EVERY SINGLE DAY. I sympathize, but please, if you're going to talk about it, give me something interesting. A few points in the book attempt to understand WHY something is bad, but he usually resorts to hyperbolic language that chastizes without providing any insight into the means of the failure. There are better social critics out there. Save yourself for authors like David Sedaris--\\"Santaland Diaries\\" in Holidays on Ice is funny and inventive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of the problem, not the solution","review":"Uninspired Saturday-Night-at-the-Improv riffs on obvious targets. The food at Red Lobster is homogenized, breaded 'n fried swill? New age music sucks? Wow, good thing we have a certified, published critic to inform us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Lobster, White Trash, Blue Lagoon","review":"This is a smug, elitist book filled with hateful comments about others. What is the point? What good does it do the world to spread such cynical views? Unlike Sedaris and Bryson who also take jabs at popular culture, Queenan is pompous and without humor. It would be better if the author kept such mean-spirited diatribes to himself. Or better yet, perhaps he should read some Charles Karault and try to appreciate those are not as \\"cultured\\" as he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"For masochists only","review":"Don't waste your money on this book.

Then sit back and be bored for three hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the ZERO stars option?","review":"I could handle the Cats and Billy Joel jabs. But you're way out of line when you berate Paulie Shore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no, it can't be","review":"Dear me, I am as much a snob as the next one, but really, this book left me cold. What let me down was that Queenan spent more time telling me X, Y, and Z sucked without ever really exploring why, and what about our culture encourages such suckiness. After a while it became so repetitive (this sucks, that sucks, etc.) and completely lacking in insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuous, petty and elitist","review":"Let me start by saying that I agree with many of Joe Queenan's observations and, even when I don't agree, I understand where he's coming from. I enjoy listening to Billy Joel and Elton John, but I also understand that their music is just that ... something light and easy to listen to. That doesn't make it bad, just inconsequential. Unfortunately, Queenan equates inconsequential with bad as only an elitist can.Elitism is not, however, the reason I gave up on this book less than halfway through. I gave up because Queenan never stops to explain what he dislikes about that which he pillories. It's just one long rant. Movies are deemed bad solely because of who's in them. Albums are deemed bad solely because of who made them. There is no insight here; no analysis of how on earth Kenny G. could have enjoyed the fleeting fame he did or what possesses people to watch Adam Sandler movies; just a petty tirade against all that is inconsequential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baseless and poorly thought out","review":"For a self-confessed cultural snob, Queenan doesn't seem to know much about the methodologies of good criticism. While an undeniably gifted rhetorician, Queenan is in rather shallow water indeed. By presenting no standard for his attacks except for some arbitrary mythical aesthetic that he declines to share, his rantings don't have any basis in any discernible paradigm of taste. Queenan simply spits out his bile with little concern for organization or insight. He comes to no grand conlusion and when at a loss for a valid objection, he devolves into the 'this sucks because it sucks' type of thing. His targets range from the too easy (Yanni, John Tesh, Cats), to the hopelessly out of date (Molly Ringwald, Love Story...Love Story!?). And some just seem out of place considering who their surrounded by (Billy Joel). Good crticism is noted for clarity of structure and rigor of thought. Both are noticeably absent here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes for the easy targets","review":"Joe Queenan's latest title is a disappointment. I expected insightful and humorous commentary, (even if I did know in advance that Queenan was attacking obvious targets such as _Cats_, _The Celestine Prophesy_ , _The Bridges of Madison County_, and, yes, Red Lobster restaurants). The cultural criticism in this book never rises above the level of \\"it sucks.\\" Oddly, the only even mildly amusing display of wit in the book is in the index's off-the-wall entries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise;repetitive, mean spirited and loses steam fast","review":"Queenan starts off with a good premise by exploring American kitsch. However, in a land overflowing with material for his book, Queenan is guilty of being repetitive and mean spirited in his attacks. The 2nd half of the book meanders and loses steam rapidly. I couldn't wait to put it down. Queenan's talents lie in the short columns and bits he does on Imus. For someone who grew up in Philadelphia and North Philadelphia at that, he displays an amazing amount of snobbery and elitism. Get off your high horse, Joe! You write for People magazine, the bible of kitsch! This is an account of a writer who has significant problems dealing with his past. And finally, what is with the attack on Billy Joel; did you two get into a bar fight or did he steal your parking spot as well in the Hamptons?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lets criticize the ciritic","review":"I found Joe Queenan's book to be that rarity, written words that are truly laugh out loud funny, Nevertheless, I will conceed that his writing could be an acquired taste. Those who do not revel in cynical or vicious humor should avoid Queenan at all costs. But for those like me who are more apt to read the newspaper review of the one star movie than that of the four star movie just for the laughs, then this book is your Valhalla. Queenan spares no medium; books, videos, concerts, cds, movies, restaurants, Broadway shows; they are all the victims of his biting wit. Even when h was trashing something that I like, I enjoyed his insights. And because he also writes it all in a bit of a winking manner and he keeps it under 200 total pages, it doesn't become overbearing.This was the first Queenan that I have read (I bought it based on hearing him on Don Imus's radio show). That I will be searching out more of his titles is the best compliment I can pay him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just terrible","review":"I bought this book thinking that it would be a witty critique of low brow American culture. Well, it wasn't witty and it wasn't a critique. It was a worthless tirade from a bitter, effete, ineffectual snob. Perhaps if Queenan was capable of producing something meaningful, he wouldn't feel compelled to be so cruel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Middle America... get over yourself!","review":"Anyone not amused by this wonderful little volume is either moronic or depressingly bourgeois. If agreeing with Mr. Queenan qualifies one as an effete intellectual snob, then I will wear the badge with honor and distinction.Mr. Queenan DOES NOT hate America; he hates our culture of mediocrity. And he hates it with style. People who complain that his assertions are to broad or his opinions uninformed entirely miss the point of this book. We are as ridiculous as we are willing to make ourselves, and he knows it.Let this be a lesson to the defenders of Americana. The elite and aristocratic have a weapon... wit. I personally plan to use this book as a litmus test for future friendships. Anyone who laughs at the addendum to the works of Abelard is surely a friend of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Bad, Not worth your time","review":"There may have been enough material here for a humorous column - unfortunately the author spreads it out (not unlike manure) through an entire book. Mr. Queenan, we get it: You don't like Billy Joel, You don't like Phil Colins, You don't like Billy Joel AND Phil Colins, You don't like Phil Colins, Yanni and Billy Joel. (If reading this was painful, you'll hate the redundancy of the book.)The irony here is, his book belongs to the same category of schlock and mediocrity that he runs on and on (and on) about in the book. Mr. Queenan, stick to writing articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queenan goes where no sensible person would - Branson","review":"I read and re-read this book, it's fall-down laughingly funny. Queenan embarks on an odyssey that begins and ends with performances of \\"Cats\\", and what lies between is truly horrifing: Billy Joel's entire oevure. John Tesh and Barry Manilow concerts. David Cassidy in Vegas. and the kicker - Branson, Missouri, where old has-beens and never-wheres go to die. This is one of the best books about our stupendously stupid culture ever produced, and while some may bristle at Mr. Queenan's snobbish attitude, they need to try and find a sense of humor. Fast food, John Grisham, and Broadway \\"musicals\\" suffer mightily at the pen of Queenan, and the book is a delight from beginning to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Judge Not Lest Ye Be Judged, Joe","review":"I wish there was a 1/2 star rating especially for books written by complete fools. Who does Joe Queenen think that he is? His lazy, unoriginal, uninformed \\"analysis\\" of popular culture consisted of his cliched, cynical mocking of a lifestyle not his own. In case you forgot, Joe, you write for TV Guide, which is pretty much a handbook to the class of folk that you are so uncunningly ripping on. Don't bite the hand that feeds you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step off your high horse, your Majesty","review":"Just because the man's last name contains a royal title does not give him the right to berate American society. If he doesn't like America and all it stands for, he should jump into the Doloren time machine back to 19th century Europe. \\"Joe Queenan's America\\" does not belong to him alone. America is a free country, and we're all entitled to our pop cultures--good or bad. The right to choose between the Opera or Chris Farley movies is our choice! Do NOT buy this book. His Royal Highness doesn't deserve the royalties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely un-funny.","review":"Queenan takes a look at contemporary America circa 1999 and makes belabored, uninsightful, derisive remarks about what he sees and he laughs at his own wit, expecting you to laugh along. I would if it was funny.If you've ever read any of his articles you pretty much know the tone here. That's his whole schtick.Anyway, if you are interested in knowing that Joe Queenan thought Cats sucked or are in the mood for a 3rd rate Dave Barry wannabe (w/o the laughs) this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...","review":"Well, I bought his book with some high hopes (I hate Jerry Lewis as well...), and I would agree that his trashing of that Western literature juggernaut, V.C. Andrews and her classic canon, \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is the apex of the \\"HA HA's\\" that this book will deliver, but over all, I was dissapointed. Too much, far too much complaining, and not enough \\"HA HA's.\\" I need more \\"HA HA's,\\" Mr. Queenan. You need more reviews of \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" and less of \\"Cats sucks.\\" And I do not mean for those comments to be taken literialy; just use them as a spring board... And by the way, Red Lobster sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elitist Garbage!","review":"So Joe, you hate America do you? Don't like Red Lobster or Blue Lagoons? Well, I have a book title for you: \\"Fellini Movies, Croissants, and Snobby Authors.\\" Being a \\"trendy\\" guy that you are, certainly you will appreciate the wit in an unhappy counterculturist, who tries to be creative, but somehow just always comes in second. Kind of like your book that I was able to get in hardback for a buck. Keep it up Joe, you're doin a great job.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"Heard Queenan for the first time on NPR and he made me laugh. I couldn't find the same person in the book! Repetitive and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and paper","review":"Joe Queenan tries so hard to be \\"cute\\"...too hard. This is the raving of an author who seems to hate everything particularly American..I found myself asking the question, so, Joe, why not try living somewhere else? This is a pseudo-intellectuals vain attempt at humor, and it is destined to end up on the bargain table at 3.98.. Still too expensive.....a complete bore from a complete bore"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"A thouroughly repellent book. Queenan repeatedly makes it clear that his beef is not in fact with \\"Cats\\" or Danielle Steele or Kenny G, but with the people who enjoy them. The pseudo-hip notion that lack of sophistication is a good excuse for contempt ought to be buried with the decade that gave it birth. As for Queenan, these latter-day Menckens ought to pay a little more attention to how the master ended his days. You can't douse everybody in sight with hatred without splattering yourself too. Lighten up, Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is delicious and therapeutic, a true value.","review":"A great stylist, Queenan ranks up there with Paul Fussell's BAD, The Dumbing of America and Class. His Red Lobster critique is written with vigor and talent. It's so easy to surrender into malaise as we contemplate the championed vulgarities of our culture, but Queenan effectively and rightfully and humorously denigrates Americans' affection for the crass and the ignorant. A must read for any critical thinker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, Humorous, and thought-provoking.","review":"This book is a must read for anyone who has ever become fed up with American Pop Culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment.","review":"Joe Queenan, a truly funny man (be it in print or ranting to Imas about Barbara Streisand,etc.), has attenpted to clone \\"If You're Talking To Me Your Career Must Be In Trouble.\\" That previous endeaver was fast paced, outrageous, and a true \\"one nighter.\\" This, on the other hand is a reach.. with each bash an attempt at one-upping himself in his assessment of his previous target. With laughs few and far between, getting through a chapter a night is a chore.Maybe for a comedy fix I'll just reread \\"Brain Droppings.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Desserts to the Cosmically Deserving","review":"This book is not elitist. Brother Queenan speaks the simple truth. We all should know by now that, in a perfect world, Michael Bolton, Kenny G and Yanni (not to mention the esteemed Mr. Tesh) should, at present, form the nucleus of a truly mediocre lounge band playing weeknights at a Ramada Inn in Des Moines. Unfortunately, as those gushing reviews of The Horse Wisperer on this very site indicate, many in the American public are unwilling to recognize the fact that their pop-subculture predilections do not rank in the same cosmos with true art. Pardon me for saying so, but Queenan ought to be issued the Congressional Medal of Honor for not showing the common, overly egalitarian tendency to spare the delicate feelings of a few misguided Celestine Prophets. The stuff is miserably bad. You can read or listen to it. You can even like it. But you are forbade from calling it other than what it is: drivel. God Bless Joe Queenan for saying so. Ahmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Queenan is even funnier than David Sidaris.","review":"I heard author Queenan read from this book last night. It is hilarious and his deadpan delivery was perfectly cynical; I went home and read the book cover to cover. Almost every line in the book is extremely funny. After admitting that I've seen \\"Cats\\" 5 times, I expected violence, but he simply smiled benevolently. He describes himself as mean, but he's a pussycat, you should pardon the expression. The only other writer who generates this much laughter from me is David Sidaris."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"I heard a radio interview with the author and thought that his quips about popular culture would be the icing on the cake of a much more substantial, humerous book. The radio interview was like a movie preview that contains all the decent parts of a bad movie. What I found on reading the book were too many conclusory \\"this sucks\\" remarks. You can get this kind of analysis on any junior high school playground.Queenan taking on Red Lobster, Kenny G, John Tesh and Cats is like shooting fish in a barrel. I wish he would try a little harder next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Queenan dropped the ball.","review":"This book could have been a funny, nasty little read. Instead, it only offered three or four good laughs and half a dozen insights. Even though the chapter is one of the funniest, everyone alright knows that Cannonball Run II is BAD. Ditto for Branson, MO and John Tesh. It's when Queenan is tearing down sacred cows that he is at his best. Particularly nasty were the (well-deserved) attacks on Billy Joel and the author of The Bridges of Madison County. Too often, however, the author just lists things that he thought \\"sucked\\" rather than explaining why they sucked. He also makes sure we know that he had good taste before his misadventures in writing this book. Elvis Costello recieved more mentions in this book than in his autobiography. Queenan is a much funnier man being interviewed than on paper. The book's only redeeming quality? Queenan found Evil Dead II to be \\"watchable.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too negative with no redeeming laughter","review":"I loved his premise of the book but 99% of the book is about things that suck and after 99 pages you get his point and with 1 laugh in the book it's not worth taking the clever journey with Mr. Queenan.

It is not acceptable to run a copy of the book through a crappy OCR, slap it up on the web, and charge $12.00 for it. My apologies to Mamet fans (I'm one myself) by giving this a low rating, but since there does not appear to be any other way to report these defects to Amazon, slamming this with a low rating appears to be my only option."},{"rating":"1","title":"the end.","review":"This will probably be my final word on this CD. First of all, let me clarify some points. The honourable critic from Madison, on the 22nd of March mentioned the Oscars. Obviously the honourable critic of Pittsburgh should get an eye check for not seeing that. Now, as for me being an amatuer...well, \\"ha!\\". Look at the arguments in the review from Pittsburgh: that the Scatman is good because he helped people. I'm sure he did, but if that is the only reason why you should buy his CD then my point has been proven. The music is so bad he needs another reason to sell. Because the music is nothing. No meaning. Nothing special. Not innovative. I could go on. The fact that he's famous because of life achievements shows how commercial the music industry has become. There is no room for genuine talent. It is sad. The only thing the Scat man inspires me to do is to shoot myself when I think about what people like him have done to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"And if I didn't know him better...","review":"Dear all,Okay, okay - we're forgetting something fundamentally important here. Each to their own opinions, right? To many, Scatman John has been an unbelievable source of upbeat positiveness, strength and a prime example of originality through a diverse musical style. To others... (fortunately, a small minority), he just doesn't suit their musical taste. Alright guys?I also happen to be a personal friend of the Scatman. I love him dearly I never met a more wonderful human being in my life. If you insist on insulting this man, do it on respectable terms, and keep it music-related. If you don't like his music, that's fine. You are at liberty to disregard John as a musician by your own taste... but don't ever, EVER insult this man as a person. By doing that you are insulting not only John himself, but the people close to him.On the original purpose of this piece... I strongly advise buying John's album, simply to see for yourself. You've never heard anything like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I understand why som people think its [bad]... In my opinion it deserves a better reputation.About half of the album is very good. The hit singles of course, but also the calm tunes like \\"Quiet desperation\\", \\"Live for the moment\\" & \\"Song of scatland\\" are superb. The \\"scat\\" is something absolutely unique and makes the album stand out in the crowd.Truly there are some misteps. \\"Only you\\" is monotone, \\"Hello luie\\" is a trowaway track and \\"Mumbo Jambo\\" is completely unlistenable. \\"Game over jazz\\" starts out promising with a uptempo jazz beat that swings like hell but when this is replaced by the usual techno beat it all falls flat to the ground.The good part of the album is still that good to make it worth listening forever, and it is both relaxing and makes you happy at one time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent epitaph","review":"I was in Japan when I heard of the death from cancer of Scatman John (Larkin). Sad news, as I felt he was about to be a big star.I hope he was pleased with the finished album, as \\"Scatman's World\\" is very intoxicating, full of scat and very tuneful. The two singles, \\"Scatman\\" and \\"Scatman's World\\", are brilliant, but \\"Quiet Desperation\\", \\"Song Of Scotland\\", \\"Time\\" and \\"Only You\\", to name four, are just as good.A mix of disco and jazz-influences, it's really pleasing to the ears and just a whole lot of fun.Good one Scat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scatman Rocks","review":"All right, anyone who does not like this cd needs to get his head examined. It's simply great. Scatman John is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"????????????","review":"It seems like John Larkin (a.k.a. Scatman John)is a happy family man and possibly just recently turned into a daddy. How else could you explain such babyish lyrics to his songs? This supposedly newborn child of his must be his lyric writer. No sane grown man could POSSIBLY compose a single song like \\"Scatman's World\\", for instance. I admit it! I had to sit and listen to it to see just how unbelievably bad it was, and by the time the song finished, I had the impression I had walked out from hearing a grown man's impressions of one child at a nursery! It's absolutely repulsive, what some people have to do to get money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know Scatman John personally","review":"Whoever made these degrading comments about his music have written unsubstantiated garbage and I was outraged at their unsubstantiated material that they call their opinions. These idiots probably do not know that the Scatman stutters and has tried hard to make it in life and he deserves it. IT'S NOT A WASTE OF MONEY AND HE ISN'T A FATHER AS SOME OF THAT PERSON SAY HE IS. These are false opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun!","review":"Great fun to listen to! An upbeat and energizing sound that will start you singing along."},{"rating":"2","title":"We'll miss ya scatman","review":"Well. I never really knew Scatman but he was a really good guy. I knew he had stuttering problems when I first listened to his music and whoa... You can't tell he does. His music is wonderful, if you do not enjoy his music you have problems, because his music is WONDERFUL. If you're feeling down, or feeling up this music is perfect. Too bad he had to die to cancer, cya...."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's not to like?","review":"I remember hearing the Scatman song when this album came out and paying no attention to it. It was cute and catchy, but I soon forgot about it. Well, here I am 10+ years later writing a review. I got the album recently, and I'm sorry I didn't get it sooner. This is pop music in the best sense of the word. The whole album is catchy, upbeat, and fun to listen to. I get the feeling the whole scat/dance beat combination was probably expected to yield only a novelty hit when Scatman John first recorded, but to his credit his talents proved appealing and the man sold millions worldwide. The album comes in at 48 minutes or so, and you'll enjoy listening to every single one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning instrumental album","review":"Cannot agree with previous poster, this is a very, very fine album, voted second best of 06 on ProgArchives.

Very disappointing. 2 stars only due to allegiance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arbitration and Mediation Made Understandable","review":"This book, while written for a business audience, uses simple, clear prose--and a sense of humor--to present \\"everything you need to know\\" about arbitration, mediation and other forms of alternative dispute resolution.

The adjustable length works well for her short stature!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sticker problem","review":"This cane came yesterday and overall it's just o.k. Quite light weight to the point of being a bit flimsy. But the problem I had was that I ordered the bronze, paying an extra $10, and found that 6 inches of the front of the cane is covered with a big white sticker. By the time this was removed and the sticky stuff gone, the cane underneath was dark and splotchy looking. Not a good thing when they advertise colors. In calling the company I learned that the sticker was not to be removed, it \\"identified\\" the cane. And that they \\"aren't responsible for what pictures Amazon posts in their sales\\". Just a little warning if you thought you wanted a color - get one that blends with the huge sticker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quad Cane","review":"I agree with Pam, Joe, Rita and Kerry. However, I think Ali Julia got it the most right. The cane is wobbly and off-set, but if you make the effort to learn how to use it it will probably be just fine. I am 68 yrs. old and 4'11\\" and weigh 125 lbs. I can't imagine a much larger person feeling safe with it. I called Customer Service at DMI for some information since the cane did not come with any instructions and was rather quickly disconnected while trying to explain my reason for calling. I did not call back and Customer Service did not return my call. As usual, Amazon did a great job getting my purchase to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and it shows","review":"Okay, I got this for my dad to be safer than his regular cane. This is made of cheap metal (it just has that thinner than average cheapie look). It adjusts easily, but the locking screw to hold it once adjusted sticks out a bit (you don't see it in the photo but it's enough to catch on things). The bottom plate with the four little legs is a cheap looking piece of metal and it's not evenly spaced....the rectangle is \\"off\\" so it looks funky. The price was right but I'll likely return and spend a bit more to get a more solid appearing cane. I bought this in black so can't report on the other colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be dangerous for wobblies","review":"Our experience is that people who are rather unsteady (wobbly), like my wife and I, may tend to trip over the base of this cane. For them a walker or rollator would be much safer. Also, the feet on this cane do not sit evenly on the floor, which doesn't inspire confidence, although it probably doesn't contribute to the tripping issue. We could not recommend this cane for wobblies, like us, and have had to give it a low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This Cane","review":"Bought this can because I was having a total hip replacement and cannot bend over for to 6 weeks to pick up my cane if it falls on the floor. The only positive thing I can say about this junky cane is that if you are careful with it, it will sort of stand up on its own. There are 4 feet one the bottom that I measured with a level and none of them are level. So when you use it, it feels like you are wobbling. It's hard enough to have a hip replacement, but to sell a cane with 4 feel that are not level is unconscionable."},{"rating":"1","title":"unusable","review":"I got this for my mom.

But I do give it credit on being unique. I don't recommend this but I can see why alot liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This album is Nektar's 1st album from 1971. Its a very psychedelic album and, in my oppinion, its by far Nektar's best album. None of their other albums compare to this one and sound like this. Nektar should have kept their style the way it is on this album on their later releases. But they became much more commercial sounding. I highly reccommend this album to any fan of psychedelic or progressive rock. I also recommend the 2nd album, A Tab In The Ocean, from 1972."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Source on a Topic that Stays Around","review":"This monograph should be accepted as the definitive source for readers interested in obtaining a full and balanced analysis of a single question: is the term 'redskin' in common usage a racial slur, or is it something else? The question is considered here in semantic and cultural terms. The author provides a thoughtful guide to the informed usage of this term for persons who want to avoid its careless use in speech and in print.

I was surprised that it received 5 stars out of 5. Now I realize there is not a lot out there in terms of Jewish Holiday movies/videos. So I really really wanted to like this. But I honestly didn't, and my 6 year old daughter was rather unimpressed as well. The puppets were ok, but the story was \\"meh\\", and the songs were repetitive and boring. My daughter was making fun of the video as we watched it together.Look, for $3.99, I would recommend you check it out and make your own opinion. Apparently I am in the minority here because 5 other reviewers rated it 5 stars. If my daughter liked it I would probably have given it at least 4 stars, but if this video couldn't even entertain a 6 year old, 2 stars is the max I would give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super melodic and rhythmic music.","review":"As in most cases Mike Mainieri's group Steps Ahead delivers top notch musicianship, presenting the innovative and almost timeless instrumentals, containing lots of rhythmic layers.Thomas Lynghus, musician, Denmark"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute for costume or pinup!","review":"Really do love this item, only had a few complaints! The first being, the belt was sooooo long. I had to cut off the end and make a new hole for the buckle, which was easy enough.

The author goes deeply into his subjects search for self realization and finding the secrets of a happy life through the mystery of \\"Tai Chi\\".This book will NOT teach you the forms of \\"Tai Chi Chuan\\" but will probably cause you to seek out a teacher to explore the wonders that the author reveals.Written in a simple form, the book will make you laugh and cry at times and will deinately touch your heart!I am buying several copies to send to friends and will keep one available for those I meet in crisis periods in their lives.My feeling is that since there are now millions & millions of people learning these ancient secrets, why not give it a chance..You'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"laws of life","review":"I had been practicing tai-chi and chi-lel for more than a year almost everyday when I started reading this book.

I wanted to understand the world my son seemed to be entering. Paul Dorrell's book helped me to understand why my artist son always seemed so driven as a child, why he thinks and acts as he does. And what a joy to discover our artist is not all that different after all! He's just very talented and creative. It's a fascinating book, and I was thrilled to think Paul Dorrell \\"made it\\" with his dream too, after all that hard, hard work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding the Gallery Biz","review":"The most valuable information--by far--in this book comes in the form of frankness. Dorrell gives hard $$ numbers and percentages regarding sales, commissions, and other dealings. This, undoubtedly, will be eye-opening for some. I really enjoyed seeing this stuff in black-and-white. Yes, we hear numbers here and there, but it's still nice to see it in print and straight from someone in the business. His sections on statements and bios I found to be very weak. And some things (like \\"newsletters\\") seem to be an afterthought. But that's not what this book is for. It will 1) prove you're not alone in living the artist's life and 2) give you enormous respect for gallerists and the hardships that some of them endure for their art and their artists. It's a very easy read and you'll appreciate the candor of this Midwestern gallery dealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"totally inspiring, honest, and thoughtful","review":"I just finished reading this book, and must admit how much I LOVED it!! This is the first art-related book I've ever read that was totally inspiring, honest, and thoughtful!

It made me realize that I must never give up on my own journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living the Artist's Life...One step at a time","review":"I found Paul's book refreshing. His candor into his own experiences in the arts and in his life helped me better understand my own struggles as an artist. It gave me renewed hope and fortitude to \\"keep on, keeping on\\". I have recommended this book to many of my friends. Those friends who have read it have also recommended it to their friends. It is well written, informative, but most of all it is a sincere dialogue of one man's set-backs and successes in the often tumultuous struggle to make a living in the arts. When you come to the \\"crossroads\\" it isn't often that you get the pleasure of a sign. This book offers the insight that can help you, as an artist, choose a path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Living the Artist's Life Helps Me Live the Artist's Life","review":"As an artist I'm always looking for insight into this peculiar world of art and art galleries. There's a whole other 'art' involved in selling art once you can produce it. I found the information in this book to be very useful and presented in a way that makes it also a fun read.

The inclusion of exercise files based on actual projects is a far superior way to learn the program than some of the basic, generic instruction found in \\"Visual Quickstart\\" books, although those books are reasonably priced and do convey a lot of information. I've bought and value those books.But Brian Wood's book is the state-of-the-art in InDesign instruction, a fitting companion to a phenomenal page design program. If you want to learn InDesign at a reasonable price, this is the only way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Contact","review":"Being the sequel to one of the most suspenseful books I've ever read, (First Evidence) I expected a lot. I didn't get quite what I expected but it was an engaging read. For the most part, this book fills in the gaps from \\"First Evidence.\\" It explains a lot and makes you go, \\"Oh yeah.\\" You must, however, read the first book or you will be lost. \\"Outer Perimeter\\" started slow but built it's intrigue bit by bit. Several times, I thought of putting it down but it finally grabbed me. Most books fizzle by the last third. This one takes off like a UFO! The ending didn't grab me but it makes me think he may be thinking of writing another one.

We don't get to know the people and, even at the end, we don't know how much of what is described in (what we will loosely define as) \\"the plot\\" is real. I found the writing ragged with the plot loose and all over the place. Ken Goddard has not thought deeply about this book before he wrote it, in my opinion. He \\"just wrote\\" and this drivel is what he ended up with. For the record, this is a story of humans tracking down the bad aliens who are causing citizens to disappear. I wish this book had disappeared before I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been more enjoyable","review":"I bought this novel based on only the reputation of the author and past novels he has written. I did not know this was one of a series. I was lost during the first third of the book trying to fathom out reasons for the actions and fears of the characters. No mention of a prior book anywhere. Lots of questions go unanswered at the end of a chapter then show up later as a flashback or a narrative as to what had happened. I may have enjoyed the book more if I had read the first of the series. I'm not really a science fiction type although some parts were plausable. I found the ending to be irritating, with unresolved questions. I doubt if I will by the next in the series if one come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cheated!","review":"...we join this X-Files in progress, and finish because there is nothing else on...Yes, I was another who purchased this book after reading the cover, where there is no mention of it being a sequel. It took reading up to the 176th page until I felt the actual story of the book started, and the summary of the last book was over. Goddard's writing style is also a little annoying, the book reads like a history text of events that are taking place in the present.I gave the book two stars because it had at least enough in it to enable me to finish the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This was by far the worst book I have ever read. I can hardly believe a publisher actually thought it was worthy to publish. The plot is ludicrous and loosely strung along.

It was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuner work ok but capo does not","review":"I was very disappointed with this tuner/capo. The tuner worked fine, although not as sensitive as my older intellitouch PT-2 tuner i've had for years. The biggest problem for me is that the capo function of this thing does not have enough clamping force to camp down on the strings firm enough! this is especially true for low E string. i'm going to return this thing and get a separate tuner and Kyser capo instead.there were so many high reviews, there is a chance i got a defective unit but it appears to be more of a design problem where the spring used is too weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"wE ALL LOVE IT IN OUR CHOIR","review":"I\`ve never been very good to put in tone my guitar. I had an electronic tuner but the problem was that everything had to be in silence so I could tune it.

Yes, it is expensive, but for people like me it\`s just the perfect buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuner doesn't pick up vibrations!","review":"The tuner sensors did not pick up vibrations very well. I would have to pluck a note several times before getting a reading and after I adjusted the tuning knobs I would have to wait again. Not at all ideal for quick tuning at live performances. Returned it and bought a standard Intellitouch tuner and used my old standard capo. Worked 100 TIMES BETTER. I would recommend a cheaper tuner and a simple capo over this attempt at a bundled item. Also, the angle of the screen is very hard to read, seeing as it has to be perpendicular with the neck while acting as a capo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looked good at first","review":"Unit stopped respondeing after about 3 weeks.

In addition to being VERY sluggish in recognizing plucked notes, it often didn't pick up the sounds AT ALL! On more than one capoed location (3 & 6), it wouldn't even read the low E string. No response. When it does respond, it's slow...and then slow to adjust to the tuning. So, you end up over-tuning.

She is moved to write it because she has killed a squirrel and is mourning its loss. Her turn of phrase is \\"If Death Ever Slept...\\"This supposes, of course, that death never sleeps. The conceptual buzz much informs this book. As detective fiction goes, it is leisurely and ruminative, so I give it only the two stars you see. However, I enjoyed its characterizations of the relationships in \\"the family.\\" Archie's insecurities and professional jealousy are never better described than they are here, and the other extended family members are given a good airing.But why did she write it? If it was because she felt bad about the squirrel and wants to share, she almost succeeds. There is too little satisfaction at the conclusion of this one; its tone of futility and moral loss rival the way the reader feels at the end of \\"Fer-de-Lance.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not recommended.","review":"I'm afraid that the reviewers who didn't like this movie understood it all too well.

With hysterical films and outlandish Saturday Night Live performances, it would be obvious that Martin would be a great choice to do a comic album. Well, in this film guys opinion, you are going to need to be a big fan of Martin to stomach this album. His humor is offbeat, never quite following a pattern or direction. Instead of actual jokes, he resorts to making noises on the album that I am sure are funny in person, but listening to it just comes off a failure. His \\"Cat Handcuffs\\" bit is humorous, but the rest becomes obvious that somebody was looking to cash in on Martin's popularity. I would have loved to see Steve Martin in concert during his younger days, I am sure that he would make me laugh my socks off, but it just doesn't translate well to day's style. I am sorry Steve, but I liked your other album better.Grade: ** out of *****"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot... sorry to all fans, but this sounds tired","review":"My apologies to all those who respect and like Steve Martin - please do not take it personally. To me, there are some stand artists who are good, and there are some who have reached the status of Holy Cows. You cannot touch them without invoking an avalanche of \\"NOT HELPFUL\\" button-clicks (watch this space folks!). To me, in this Hall of Tired and Not So Funny Humor there is Monty Python, Robin Williams and yes - Steve Martin.I do not think Steve Martin is even a good actor. He is as one-dimensional in his on-screen act as he is in his stand-up performances. Some of the jokes might have been funny 25 years ago, today they are just sad. Incidentally, he shares the same sad charcteristic with Robin Williams: for the poor quality of writing they compensate with a \\"charged\\" performance.Give me something else, please - because not all good things get better with time.

Virtually word for word. Above all the other versions, this one captures the feel of the story, the spirit of the story and the meaning of the story. The others, updated and reset in America are just plain not THE WAR OF THE WORLDS. At three hours, it runs long. But so does King Kong, Lord of the Rings and Star Wars.

The vivid accounts of the book are realized in a artistic fable like way. The Martians and their machines raise havoc and spread fear as people are obliterated and run to save their lives. The movie tells a wonderful story for all. It's one story that you can just imagine having taken place, seeing the terrors of a world under attack from beings from another planet. What makes it so scary is, that in Victorian times, it was plausible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed but Watchable","review":"This version of War of the Worlds is obviously done on a budget. The cast act against a bluescreen backdrop, which can be a little diconcerting at times. It also seems to me that the spoken words tend to go out of synchronisation with the picture at certain stages.

Next best, the Martians striding all over the place, picking up people, throwing people--awesome!--spider machines, blowing away everyone, the main writer dude beating the sh*t out of the curate.Low parts: it's really a miniseries calling itself a movie.

I had read about the budget and effects not being on a par with Spielberg's movie. I was surprised to find that none of that mattered. The effects were obviously meant to be stylized, like the movie SIN CITY. In fact the style of the effects were so similar to SIN CITY that this WAR OF THE WORLDS felt like it was part of a series including SIN CITY. Though H.G.WELLS' THE WAR OF THE WORLDS is not in black and white except for an opening scene of footage from the Victorian days.The aliens are frightening. The acting is solid and appropriate to the material.You can see the years of work put into this movie. Some might not like this movie as the story relies on the actual plot from the book and most movies don't offer much of a plot nowdays. But the movie is worth wading through a few slower bits in order for the story to unfold. Like 90% of the book is on the screen. And it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh take on a classic.","review":"The movie is based on a best selling book by H.G. Wells.

Hopefully they will make many more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Right century, wrong quality","review":"its a treat to see this H.G.

This film is true to the original book, and set in the same time period. Unfortunately that is where the similarity ends, as this is so badly made it makes you cringe. Firstly the acting is terrible, and it is all to apparent the none of the actors are english. Their accents are reminiscent of Dick Van Dyke in Mary popppins. The CGI special effects are laughable, and the film has this annoying orange hue throughout.I dodnt finish watching the film, and quite frankly it was a waste of good money. My advise is dont bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing they have the nerve to sell this","review":"This film is so bad you cannot believe that anyone would release it. It doesn't even look started let alone finished. The film seems to be a raw assembly with no real editing. The special effects are all unfinished. The photography is terrible. The acting is much worse. Even the moustaches are fake and falling off. And there is a very odd gay vibe through the whole film that I doubt was in the novel. If Spielberg did not have a film coming out this year there is no way any sane person would ever put this out.

Well that \\"let's put on a show\\" spirit survives in the Pendragon version of WotW. Unfortunatly the home made props and bad performances also survived.I really wanted to like this DVD because the idea of doing WotW in the appropriate time period is an admirable endeavor. However, after seemingly neverending shots of men walking (or running) along an unpaved road and hundreds of reaction shots of actors(?) reacting to something other than what was being shown on the screen, my patience wore a little thin. By the time I got to the incredibly bad Thunderchild sequence, I was sure I had been transported to the satellite of love but Mike or Joel and the robots were nowhere to be found.I guess good intentions don't always make for good entertainment and this isn't good entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gift That Says...","review":"The one gift to give when you want to tell someone \\"I hate you\\". Really, this was just such a poorly done waste of time. Just terrible! I only paid $10.00 for it, and I STILL feel like I got ripped off. Shot on video (and it looks it) with student-grade special CGI effects, this film is the \\"Plan 9 From Outerspace\\" of our time...no wait, I take that back. \\"Plan 9\\" is too good a film in comparison to insult by grouping it in with this piece of rubbish. I spent half the time fast forwarding through the horrible acting and the main character running around the back woods as he constantly tripped and fell in panic. Seriously, I had my DVD player set on x16 and the scenes still lasted like 10 minutes each!! Do yourself a favor and pass on this one. I'd rather be hit by a heat ray then have to sit through this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Ambitious","review":"After the recent release of Spielberg's version, I decided to read the original book by H.G. Wells. This movie apparently was made by purists who wanted to apply the book directly to the screen.Overly ambitious for the budget, the movie is somewhere between bad and artsy. It is in dire need of an editor. Having the same actor play the narrator AND his brother is a bit strange, and made comical by the cheap prop mustache. The special effects are archaic.It is, however, a must for a collector on War of the Worlds items."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Wott nooos too-dey?\\"","review":"Never have so few mangled so many words of the English language as the cast of this home movie. None of them can do an English accent but figure that if they mispronounce a word completely in the most surreal way then that'll do. It's hysterically funny for the first few minutes, but then you realise the film is so slow and so bad that you feel your will to live being sapped. It's the most crazily incompetent film ever made, bad on every single technical level and a lousy bit of storytelling to boot. When it takes 50 minutes for the Martian cyclinder to open, you know these poor deluded fools don't know the first thing about how to make a film. I doubt they even had a script. It plays like they had a copy of the book and passed it round before each take! Pathetic. It's almost worth buying to see just how bad a film can be, but in the end it's just too long and boring to provide much in the way of laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-Hundred-Eighty Minutes...wasted","review":"Keep a good book or a stack of old magazines handy while watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why waste words?

Please, Please, Please do not, I repeat, do not buy this piece of crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bakshi as Hines mentor?","review":"Ummmmm--so why did all the previous reviews for this product disappear? Perhaps Pendragon complained about the overwhelmingly negative reviews.I bought this movie at Wal-Mart; as a professional-quality movie it is a disaster. The cinematography borders on the bizarre (veering from night to day and back again in the same action sequence--very reminiscent of \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\"). The CGI is the quality of that found on an early 90s video game; the acting is distinctly amateur and the script atrocious. This movie reminded me of Ralph Bakshi's \\"Lord of the Rings' cartoon of the 1980s--it has the same unfinished, hastily-edited look.I gave this 2 stars in the review that seems to have been removed from Amazon. On further reflection, I think that 1 is warranted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!!","review":"Oh, I am not saying this DVD is bad, but it is worse than that awful Van Gogh VHS my sister-in-law got me for Christmas at the dollar store because it was on sale. That is not to say there were no good moments.The repititious screen saver like animation was mildly amusing as was the stilted dialogue. The screen saver stuff reminded me of \\"Mary Poppins\\"...if \\"Mary Poppins\\" were blowing up... And, what about that Anglican priest? Was he comedy relief,or what? What I am saying is that someone owes me 180 minutes of my life back. I am not kidding.

There really aren't any redeeming features to this movie except the wonderful premise RUINED by terrible acting (acting ???), awful special effects (the \\"boat scenes\\" have to be seen to be believed !!). It must've had a budget of less than a million dollars (certainly not the reported 45 million spent...........spent on what !!!???)

OH, GOD, MY EYES!","review":"Can a low budget feature be both astonishingly bad and hilariously pompous? The answer is yes, and the proof is this movie and the hype leading up to its release.

There's not much that can be said that hasn't already been. The acting is terrible, the special effects are some of the worst ever seen by human eyes, and the movie as a whole is completely the most boring thing I have ever witnessed. The color filters of the film change between almost every seen and the fake mustache of the main character is hillarious. I didn't even finish watching the movie because I thought I might suffer an extensive ammount of brain damage. As previously stated in other reviews, its seems this movie was rushed and released to make a quick buck by confusing buyers with the Spielberg version or something to that effect. In fact, I bought this DVD on accident myself.All in all: I wanted to cut my eyes out with a rusty knife and set myself on fire because of this film (ie lump of feces)."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS FILM IS SO BAD YOUR EYEBALLS WILL BLEED","review":"I'm here to tell EVERYONE that all the 'Very Good!' 'Terrific!' 'Excellent!' 'I really liked this movie!!!' reviews you see here ARE PLANTED BY THE FILM COMPANY'S PRESS PEOPLE!! THE FILM IS DREADFUL. PERIOD. ANY GOOD REVIEWS WERE DONE BY PRESS FLACKS WHO ARE PAID FOR WHAT THEY WRITE. DO NOT - REPEAT - DO NOT BELIEVE ANY GOOD REVIEWS HERE - THOSE ARE THE FAKED ONES. Read all the other reviews and you'll know who is telling the truth and WHO IS A PRESS FAKE! If I had my way, I'd kick each and every one of these Moronic, Cretinous Bastards in the balls. They are paid whores. By the studio that cannot even do a decent job of production. I have seen college films by sophmore students that show more talent that this mess did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great shame","review":"This film IS a faithful dramatisation of the book, for which, as a fan I am grateful.Unfortunately it is also an example of what cannot be achieved without sufficient funding. The acting is unconvincing and the special effects, CGI work is very poorly produced. It reminds me of live action films of the fifties interspersed with Hanna Barbera cartoons, which is a pity.It just doesn't work, and even if one is a fan of the story, I would not recommend buying this film, which is a great shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"If you are looking for one of the worst versions of \\"The War of the Worlds\\", you have come to the right place. This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my entire existence. Don't waste your money on this one. Timothy Hines has been in the movie business for 20 years? I think it's time he starts thinking of a different career."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love bad Sci-Fi movies . . .","review":"You're gonna love this.This thing would have made H.G.Wells give up writing. The cheap effects and editing are bad enough. But a full 1/3 of the film is someone running through the woods or down the lane. The CGI tripods almost move in a stop action animation manner. Much of the special effects look like they were done for a Playstation or X-Box and the color of the film looks like an early cheap porn flick. It almost looks like the same special effects crew that did the Doctor Who television shows. The dialog is horrible. Even the main character's mustache looks fake & cheesy. AND THIS SUCKER IS 3 HOURS LONG!!!!If you are deep into Sci-fi stay away from this. But if you love really bad movie making. This movie ranks with Vampire Men from the Lost Planet for the worse Sci-Fi movie ever made. Elvira would love this thing and it cries out for Mystery Theator 3000.Watch it if you get the chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done","review":"Being familiar with the Wells story, and assuming that everyone else is too, I didn't expect them to use the same old tired solution about a virus in this movie. After all, they completely changed the Wells story around in so many ways. The least they could do is come up with an original solution. Even Independence Day resorted to the old virus trick.The movie is boring. I couldn't watch it straight through without doing something else. While the movie was running on DVD I turned to Amazon and did a review of The Godfather, which is of course a far superior film to this silliness.Guess what happens right after our hero sees a fallen alien. Yeah, his kid runs up, his long lost kid, with his wife not far behind. What a coincidence. And that pastor, what an annoyance he was. Save me, Jesus.This is simply a poorly done movie. Don't waste your time or money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely Entertaining Film","review":"We went out and bought H.G. WELLS expecting to see a comicly bad film. We'd been hearing so-so reviews here and a lot of over-the-top slamming of the film. How funny that it turns out to be good and has style.Purely entertaining film, insanely respectful of the source material with fun visual effects and bright three-dimensional performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best period flick in a while.","review":"Its has all sorts of great elements- Action, comedy, and drama. Sure the plot is a hundred years old, our fate is in the hands of God while Martians invade the earth with cool technology and firing power. I know it sounds dumb, but it does make a great popcorn flick. What was also good about this movie was the relationships. The writer & wife, the astronomer and the people of horsell, the artilleryman and the soldiers, the curate with his annihilated parish, the elphinstones without their leader/husband George--absolutely great. I haven't enjoyed a period flick like this since Pride & Prejudice with Colin Firth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed watching.","review":"I truly enjoyed watching this movie and was inspired to read more about Victoriana.For H.G.Wells fans, no, the movie is not a 100% exact but I would say about 80%. Keep in mind that this is a movie and therefore should be judged based on the entertainment level and not the exactness of its period story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film does a good job.","review":"The film does a great job of capturing a simple, normal life atmosphere that descends into an unsettling nightmare world. Also, making it take place in 1898 creates a fantastic world of its own, making the suspension of disbelief easier. The acting gives you the impression throughout that these people are actually these people. The degeneration of their spirits during the Martian seige is real. The film also does a good job scaring the viewer. Check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"My eyes! MY EYES!!!","review":"I can no longer see because of this movie! Run away! Flee for your life!The worst....and I mean THE WORST film I have EVER SEEN. EVER! To call this \\"War of the Worlds\\" is a slap in the face to the great H.G. Wells. If there were some way to show this \\"film\\" to him, I'm sure Mr. Wells would have changed his name and MOVED TO MARS to get as far away as possible from this god-awful movie.Thank goodness I saw this for free! If I had to pay for this DVD, I would have driven to Mr. Hines' house and beat the money out of him.STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable.","review":"The effects seem outdated compare to the astonishing CGI movies of nowadays but it has something that will keep it on the SCI FI classic list: it tells a great story.The film is enjoyable. The characters and action are like masterpiece theater. It captures H. G. Wells original tale with awe and wonder. A very faithful adaptation. What more do you need?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable musical movie.","review":"The movie is enjoyable in that the feeling of calm-before-the-storm is created so well. That made the subsequent outpouring of Martian fire power more appreciable. It also created a rhythmic, musical feeling to the whole piece. Like a grand music video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective Movie -- Wells' to the screen.","review":"A classy picture. Effectively conveys the disillusionments of war and will of survival. Though slow moving at times, the cast makes up for it with chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!","review":"After reading other reviews here I cannot believe they have seen the same film, either that or they work for Pendragon pictures!This film is a travesty, truely awful by any standards.. no amount of lack of experience or budget can forgive this.The acting is awful, the ZX Spectrum could do better graphical effects and the editing was dire at best.Do yourself a favour, save your money and avoid like the plague! Rated 1 star as I can't choose 0"},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars out of five, huh?","review":"If this is such a 5-star masterpiece, why are there 40 used copies for sale?Seriously, if all the 300+ \`I'm-not-Tim-Hines-but-this-movie-masterpiece-will-cure-all-known-diseases' reviews aren't dodgy, why are there 40 used copies for sale as of today? Surely this would be a keeper? If you're one of those conned into buying it and have seen it, the reason's obvious. Of the two cheap ripoffs of the Spielberg film, this is easily the worst, made quickly with no money and a cast of camp non-actors and ex-porn starlets who borrowed a camcorder for a few hours. Painful to watch, you'll probably spend more buying the DVD than these talentless shameless moneygrabbers did making it. Like the phoney reviews here, this is just another con trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"I've been waiting for this \\"true to the book\\" version for over a year. I was shocked to find it had gone right to DVD without a theater release...until I watched the DVD I bought! \\"Theater group\\" acting and CGI that was worse than a cartoon ruins this effort. In fact, effort is the right word...it TOOK an effort to sit through this to the end! A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word sums this up rubbish","review":"this has to be one of the worst films ive ever seen.

As a fan of science fiction films, I was anticipating a movie which could rank very high among my favorites. Instead, this is one of the most poorly done films I have ever seen: editing, acting, lighting, continuity, script, etc. This is no way to bring a classic sci-fi novel to the screen! The poor quality of the production interferes with any appreciation of the plot. I am still waiting for an authentic film of WOTW which is both faithful to the book and professionally made. If you are wondering if you should spend your money on this version of WOTW, my advice is to go to the Book section of Amazon and buy the paperback instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you running out of fake names Timbo?","review":"Fred B.

YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO BELIEVE HOW BAD IT IS.EVEN AS A MASSIVE FAN OF SI FI AND INDEED WOTW I COULDNOT FIND ONE MOMENT IN THE FILM TO MAKE A SINGLE GOOD COMMENT OF, HOWEVER THIS WOULD BE A VERY LONG REVIEW IF I LISTED THOSE THAT WERE BAD. A WASTE OF A DVD PRESSING AND CERTIANLY A WASTE OF MY MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Film School Project","review":"That's what this movie looks like. A poor quality film school project that got a failing grade. The acting is poor and the cinematography is even worse. They seemed to blue screen everything, and poorly at that. Would it have been too hard to find a location to shoot like film school graduates?Don't waste your money on this version. Go buy another like the 1950's version. You'll be much happier. Trust me. However if you need a drink coaster this would do nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Fields","review":"After suffering through this garbage for three hours I thought they should have called The War of the Fields. Why? Because the martians land in a field, the writer's house is in a field, the writer tells his wife and maid to wait in a field while he walks through a field to get a horse and buggy that has no horse,he takes them to her cousin's house which I think was in a field,he goes to return the horse? and buggy and then wanders through a field for a half an hour, the curate finds him in a field, the writer's brother leaves London and encounters a field. I've read the book several times and I don't remember there being so many fields. Maybe Timothy Hines owns a lot of land. These are just a few things that are bad about this movie. It does follow the book but just because the writer does walk a lot doesn't mean we have to see it for half of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretchedly Awful","review":"I got this at Walmart for $9.00, which IMO is $9.00 too much. Simply put, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen..it easily surpasses howlers like \\"Battlefield Earth\\". From CGI graphics inferior to an average PS2 game, 60's era special effects, the awful cinematography, ludicrous acting, and excessive length, it is a complete waste of time and money. The other reviews critical of this \\"film\\" are dead on accurate, this movie stinks!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spirit and Legacy of Ed Wood Lives On","review":"Ernest? Yes, I'll give it that. Faithful to Wells's novel? Well, umm, yes--but in decidedly wrong-headed, (and all too frequently) unintended comical ways. A film in which those involved can be proud? Oh, sure...but only if you're operating on the same level of self-delusion as that late, great film _enfant terribe_ of Le Bad Cinema, Ed Wood. So, friends, because of its' famous literary lineage, you can count on this amateurish, frequently embarrassing, and half-baked direct-to-video production of one of the world's truly great novels living on and on (gorge rising), having immediately joined the exhalted ranks of the Worst Films of All Time. Another high example of that very low art form, it's director a new Ed Wood for the digital age. Mr. Wells would be ever so proud..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"I thought this movie was a put-on for the first few minutes, then I realized it was actually as bad as it seemed. I paid very little for it and it still cost too much. The acting is what you might expect from a fourth-grade class doing their first run-through of the school play. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain terrible","review":"This was the worst video that I have seen. It looked like it was made on someones home computer with the most rudimentary software. It is very jerky. The scenes all look like they were made on a computer. The acting was terrible. All of the acting was over the top. Fake mustaches look very fake. Its only redeeming value is that it followed the book exactly. Might as well listen to the book on tape. I can't believe that this thing was even sent to the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"A HAUNTING MOVIE - WITH ACTION","review":"Me and my friends just watched this movie tonight. It was very touching. It made you feel like you were there at the end of the world as the Martians defeat the humans. This is like no other movie I have ever seen. Some in the group though it was a little slow in a couple of spots but they liked it too. I took one star off for that, but you won't be sorry if you like to try different experiences. This movie stands out in its style and way of storytelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of rubbish!","review":"You cannot call this absurd rubbish a film. It looks like the video hasn't been edited but just copied direct from the master tape, the special effects aren't finished and it looks like a bad wedding video only with worse actors and fake face hair. This isn't a film, it's an insult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut-price DVD cuts book to shreds: worst film of the century!","review":"For three tedious hours this bad home movie follows the book blindly and at excruciating length. It doesn't do it remotely well, but if you really like Wells and can overlook everyone in this film not knowing what they're doing, that might just be enough to get you through it. But then they run out of money, ignore the entire last third of the book and hurriedly add a tacked-on ending from near the end of the book (not even the proper end of the book) in the hope no-one will notice!A bad joke, this is even worse than The Island of Dr Moreau. This people have no business making this kind of excuse for a film, let alone selling it to unwary sci-fi fans. Avoid at all costs!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better items than this to buy from Amazon.com","review":"Think of the worst movie you've ever seen...this one is worst. The good reviews I'm seeing on this site must be there to sucker you into wasting your money...I know I did. I've definitely learned my lesson. Ignore the great packaging and visit www.imdb.com first before dropping cash on this scam. If I see the name Timothy Hines associated with any movie in the future, I will steer clear. Lousy effects, acting, editing, and music. There's nothing good to be said about this movie. Avoid this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Storyboard using human actors.","review":"I did see the big WOW this summer. I knew that this one was trying to get out. If you must have a version more like the book, then I guess that this is it. There is too much walking around, as other have said it seems that nearly every foot of digital film shot was used to get it up to the three hour running time. I would have preferred a more \\"Classics Illustrated\\" like version of this movie. I did not pay much for it, but I also probably won't watch it again. Just too long for the payoff. It seems more like a storyboard using human actors, instead of drawings. I did want it to get out, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 reviews - how many are by the director?","review":"No-one else could be so stupid to think this garbage is anything like a real movie, let alone a classic.

But true, no-one else will after seeing this rubbish.No stars for this fakery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"William Goranson","review":"This is simply an awful movie. The only good point is that it's true to the book. If you are in the mood for 1960's British Sci-Fi effects then give it a go. Anyone else get Jeff Wayne's CD rendition and use your imagination. If I could give it less then 1 star I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY dissapointing","review":"My mom bought this movie for me for my birthday as well as the newest version with Tom Cruise. This version is so poorly done, we fast forwarded through the whole thing. It's so bad it's funny. To think someone could make this movie and expect people to actually enjoy it. Throughout the whole movie, it's like they're pussyfooting around to get to the good stuff (which there was none). There were quite a few CG effects that looked like they were done by a child. Very dissapointed in it. Do yourself a favor and save your money and use it towards the version with Tom Cruise and Dakota Fanning. Seeing Dakota's performance in it was worth the money alone. I saw it twice in theatre and enjoyed every bit of it. It had me talking for months"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put a chain on Wells' grave, he's a coming to get ya!!!!!!!","review":"What a disaster!CGI houses, CGI horses (couldn't even rent a damn horse), CGI boat and really, really bad CGI, like it was done in Home Depot's home renovation softwware, UGH...Acting was not used in this film, some sort of cross between the zombies in Dawn of the Dead and too much bad wine....Was it faithful to the book, yes, but poor poor H.G. Wells, he must be very sad indeed.Don't let Harrihousan see this!!!!!!!!!!Is Tim Hines the reincarnation on Ed Wood????? Is this Plan 9 From Outer Space????I waited a long time for this movie, knowing full well that it was not going to be on par with the Spiegel/Cruise Block Buster, I actually hoped it would be a bit campy but still competent.

However, the acting in this film is dreadful. The characters are 1 dimensional and simply don't interact. In fact wooden is the only term that comes to mind. I could forgive the awful CGI effects but when combined with a poorly directed, edited and acted film the end result is barely watchable.The reason I have given it two stars is because it is faithful to the book and therefore Wells' story telling manages to come through-just.A hefty re-edit and deletion of some of the worse CGI effects might improve the film, for example, let us imagine the Martians feeding.If you love the book the film might be worth watching but I wouldn't rush to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time or money!","review":"This movie will give \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space\\" a run for worst movie ever made. There is truly nothing redeeming about this. Please, take my word for it. I know how it feels to want something new from this great story, but this is NOT it.I would give you specifics but the fact is I would have to recount the entire movie. The acting is terrible, the cinematography would not pass a college course, and the interpretation of the original material is by far the worst.It took WEEKS for me to get through the whole film. I literally had to stop over and over because I just couldn't take it! When I eventually did finish I put the CD away and swore I would never inflict such pain on myself again. If I could give this no stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"This is very poorly done in terms of the graphics but very accurate to the book. the main problem is that every thing is CG and CG sucks in this film.It is worse than before computer anamation times like in the 50s. not evan fire can be real, or crowds, or horse and carts, or a boat at sea, and most of the shots that are not cartoon are people obvousily making pretend scared faces when the clanc-clanc of the tripods is heard.

The CGI is DOA on this one. How could they have the nerve to release it? OK the acting is better than the Tom Cruise version, but that's like saying gonnorhea is better than herpes. Three hours of amateur film, and is there actually an editor here? The video game quality FX is not laughable, its tear jerkable.

Forget bad period detail or the fake use of American locations and bad American actors, the real villain is the script. It skips much of what is great about the novel, such as Dead London, and leaves all the trivia. It's as if the writer read the book but couldn't understand it at all and kept in all the wrong things. The result is a complete travesty of the book. Even the few good moments in the script, like the encounter with the Artilleryman, are over-edited down. The fact that the actor in the part has no idea what an English accent sounds like just turns the scene into comedy.Wells would hate it and so will you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing Is Believing","review":"This \\"movie' is terrible.Before you spend any money on this abomination go to the official Pendragonpictures website and take a look for yourself at some stills from the movie.

Thank God I did. While I did enjoy the look of the walkers in Spielberg's version they didn't walk and the movie was a mess. I spent over 50 bucks taking my wife to watch Tom Cruise go up an alien... what exactly I don't know.This movie, in comparison, is a big treat. It succeeds at being both entertaining and thought-provoking. The Martians are incredibly good throughout and I liked this movie from start to finish.

Wells The War of the Worlds\\" by Timothy Hines is probably one of the most misunderstood and undervalued films released recently.To me it had a lot of value for the following reasons:1) Artistically it is an attempt to portray what a film would look like if it were released say in the early twenties so the tinting and special effects are very much in the tradition of that era;2) Anyone who has enjoyed the other \\"War of the Worlds\\" films inspired by H.G.

Boy was I in for a ride from movie hell.This movie was possibly...no, was most defintely the worst thing I have ever had to endure. My 8th grade Hillel Day School version of Fiddler on the Roof was more exciting to watch...and it's on VHS from 1991 sans special effects!

They would be cut down to 10 or 20 minutes, and sometimes mediocre films would be much better with all the padding cut out. Bad films would become fun sometimes. But even on Super 8mm, you couldn't improve this. Why? Because it's all padding. Anything to avoid telling the story in the book. Honestly, there is NOTHING there for 97% of the time, and when it does try to throw in a big scene like the battleship fighting a war machine, it just looks like something a four year old might come up with on his Fisher Price My First Computer.

Tim Hines thinks his audience have no intelligence every step of the way. He constantly has his terrible leading man narrate what is happening as if we are too stupid to guess for ourselves. Every minor point is repeated again and again in case we missed it.All plot points from the original book are touched without any emotional depth or nuance by a supremely untalented filmmaker. Performances are clumsy and hammy at best and Hines has no idea how people interact. The silent dinner sequence is a classic example of pointless padding, bad acting and hopeless directing. It adds nothing and makes his pitiful players look even worse than they already did. Impressive achievement.For all the Pendragon shills on this site giving themselves a round of applause - how many more Bravos or Congratulations Mr Hines can they fake? - this film deserves only the loudest of boos. My cat has dragged in better."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE BORN EVERY MINUTE","review":"This film is a complete waste of time.

The whole time I was left wondering whether I hated this film or love it. In the end I'd have to say it was a bit of both. I loved it for its characters, story, filming and martians. I hated that they didn't have a bigger budget. This film is an instant classic that will be quoted over and over again.

I was disapointed when the release date was put back, but encouraged when I discovered the delay was in order to improve the special effects. Pendragon was promoting an epic to rival the production of the Lord of the Rings.When the movie was released I had to import a copy from the USA as it's not available in the UK.The movie follows the book very close, but those extra special effects are the worst I've ever seen. They are not just low budget they have been produced with the least effort. Dr Who in the 70's at least attempted to make what you saw believable!The begining of the movie is very detailed and the end of it is thrown together. As the movie goes on the effects get worse.

Its 180 minute runtime could easily have been shortened to a more tolerable 120 minutes by trimming out all of the pointless dramatic pauses and excess footage of people running, walking, and otherwise milling around (not to mention all of the pointless dialog).Even if you can find your way through all the boring dialog, overlook the main character's fake mustache (it almost stares back at you!), and annoyances induced by the plethora of false backgrounds, amateur effects & film-school-drop-out editing, you'll still find yourself bothered by the jumpy/jittery playback evident in almost every scene as if the movie were playing back on an underpowered computer with a painfully slow hard drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap endless boring ripoff","review":"Look carefully before you buy.

This without doubt is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I can only wonder what poor Mr Tim Hines was trying to achieve.The film itself did follow the original book quite well. However, the acting, editing, filming and special effects were terrible. The tripods were amazing, they could actually walk through a forrest without disturbing a single leaf, the Thunder Child scene was pianfully funny, the ship looked like she was made of Lego and the whole scene looked like it was done on a home computer, an old one at that. I am a WOFW fan but this film has not done the orignal book any favours. Perhaps the re-edited version of the film will be better, but I have my doubts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A miracle!","review":"A miracle this thing actually got released. You almost have to work at making a movie this bad. Nothing I can say will do it justice. I simply can't decide which aspect is worse between the acting, the effects or the shockingly poor timing and drawn out scenes. I give credit for the concept- to FINALLY make a true-to-the-novel version, but the anticipation of such a thing made watching this one that much more bitter.

Poor acting, Very poor CGI and practical effects, accompany a glacial pace that may be suitable for a late 1800's era novel, but never for a film.Save your time and money for almost any other pursuit, including re-reading H.G. Wells' novel itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"All in all it's solid and powerful.","review":"The movie is pretty faithful to the book. It's beautifully shot and the scenery is gorgeous.

Very nicely laid out.A beautiful weepy with enough explosions and action for the boys, too. All in all it a solid and powerful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Piece of Trash Ever","review":"This is probably the worst and most boring \\"film\\" I have ever seen. It is so incredibly bad that it is just bad.It looks like it was shot on a home video camera by a chimpanze.This was clearly put out by the distributor in hopes that people would confuse it with the Spielberg production. I see no other reason for this piece of garbage to have seen the light of day. The people who give this \\"film\\" high marks must have been watching a different movie or be friends with Tim Hines the director. From what I can tell Hines is such an untalented pretentious hack that it boggles the imagination. Some may think this film is so bad it is good. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time. Stay home and watch some paint dry instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I've ever seen!","review":"I'm not saying there aren't worse, just that I've not seen them.

It's certainly very different and I learned a lot. Namely -1. Wells' novel is not set in Woking, England, but in Washington State2. The narrator is not a writer but a Freddie Mercury impersonator years ahead of his time3. Waterloo Station, London looks just like Seattle4. No-one could talk with a proper English accent in England5. The Martian war machines are not solid, so they are able to float through water without disturbing it6. London was a medieval village7. It's entire population was one woman, but she committed suicide8. Big Ben is lighter than air9. Martians look like blancmange10.

Zero Stars If Possible!!","review":"I normally like sci-fi films and TV and can even enjoy B-movie films and programmes. But believe me this DVD is the worst film you will ever see. It has terrible acting - the actor playing Wells looks like a bandit and sound too weedy and carries no authority in the part. And the CGI is the worst you'll ever see - a 3 yeard old kid and an old PC could produce better. Please save your money or give it to charity - just don't buy this DVD! I've already binned my copy; I wouldn't even give it away as it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than a poke with a stick... On second thought.....","review":"It's the best work the amateur volunteers workshop has ever done with over 2 weeks experience! With over twelve dollars budget for special effects, and nearly double that for costumes. Acting so good you will swear their features are carved in wood. It's better than \\"Ishtar\\" and \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\"! (Well, maybe not quite that good). It's perfect for collectors who like this stuff! Don't fail to miss it if you can! Antidotes are being concocted as you read this! Totally faithful to the book, but the author is still spinning in his grave. The story beats the Speelburg movie by miles, but it just flops otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of effort","review":"This is heartbreakingly awful. Done by amateurs with amateurish results. From someone who really wanted this to be worthwhile I can only express my total disappointment. This should be used in film school as a textbook account of how not to make a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"I'm sorry, but even with so many people trying so hard to state the positive about this film, it is pants. To my mind, nothing works. The feeble attempt to give a feel of pre-war films with colour & jerkiness just looks like an error with the DVD formatting. There is no acting in this film - I can't believe any actor is so bad, so it must have been intended. Why?!!! I do not believe that the film was edited at all - the irrelevant footage left in all through it is mind numbing - how many times do you see the same people going back and forth in the woods or stumbling up and down the slope of the crater in the first half hour? The special effects are dreadful - even on a low budget, technology today can do better than black lines around the superimposed images and fire looking like it has been drawn on badly afterwards. Too long as well. This film reminded me of \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\" - except that Plan 9 was more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Production Values","review":"I bought this version after reading that it closely followed the plot of the book, but after watching about 45 minutes, I decided I could take no more. The \\"choppy\\" quality of the video was quite distracting, and even easy scenes to shoot, like a man walking down a path, appear to have been digitally done, and poorly at that. The special effects are perhaps the worst I've seen since the fifties.All in all I would say this is comparable in quality to a project done by college students using amateur equipment and methods.It is one of the few DVDs I have thrown in the trash after purchasing. It is really THAT bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth $8.42 from Walmart.","review":"I bought this based on favorable reviews from Amazon users. Boy, was I disappointed. While I did enjoy the fact that it was the most faithful adaptation of the book, the stiff acting, editing (or lack thereof), and dreadful special effects render the film nigh-unwatchable. It is also extremely slow-paced. Honestly, this film looks worse than most college student-produced movies I have seen. The special effiects, and even the actors, resemble cardboard cut-outs on sticks being waved around (absolutely the worst mise-en-scene I have ever seen - below even Ed Wood's standards). Do yourself a favor, and read Well's novel if you are really curious about what a Martian invasion in the late 19th Century would be like. Or check out the Little Book of Horror - War of the Worlds by Steve Niles and Ted McKeever.

It is the only explanation I can think of.The affrontery of passing this off as a legitimate feature film in the end cancelled any sympathy I had for the lack of talent in every single department. Three hours of self-delusion.If they had admitted openly that they only had a few hundred dollars to make this video, my sympathy might have prevailed.It is so amateurish in every way. But lack of money is no excuse for lack of talent.Do the makers truly and honestly believe this to be worthy of the HG Wells book?

Absolute trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cometh Snoopy","review":"Here we find the years in which Snoopy becomes more of his own character, rather than just the dog that pops up in various comics. He becomes his own person, develops a complex personality, and, in a way, becomes a voice for Schulz.I loved this set, but found myself laughing 8.9% less (a guesstimate) than in previous years. But don't let that deter you. It's Peanuts, and there's no arguing of Schulz's brilliant imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collected Classic Peanuts","review":"Well, actually, once Charles M. Schulz got up to speed, which did not take long, almost every strip was a classic. Charles M. Schulz is the greatest American cartoonist who ever lived. Feel free to quote me! Fantagraphic Books is owed a heaping helping of gratitude for diligence of publication. Forget those previous publishers that dropped strips from the continuity or even printed the same strip twice in the same title. Leaving dates in the strip insures accuracy, precluding omissions. My, if Fantagraphics only printed the Sundays in color, they would deserve 6 stars!! (So, don't be giving away \\"Peanuts Jubilee\\" or other titles that reprinted Sundays in color.) Includes the entire fuzzy-face saga. A must buy for fans, public and school libraries. Hey, academic libraries, bless their pointy little heads, can buy a copy too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The good old days...","review":"This book reminds us all how brilliant Peanuts was in the first several decades of its life. Though I felt the strip became less piquant and a bit too \\"nice\\" in its observations about life in the last few years before Schulz' retirement, the early years were sharp and inciteful, as you'll see from this book.Nothing can touch some of the observations in the Peanuts series. I still remember vividly the strip in which Linus excitedly told Charlie Brown about the most amazing football game he had ever seen on TV, in which the home team was trailing with seconds left but courtesy of a miracle play scored with no time left on the clock. Linus breathlessly added how people were pouring out of the stands and how all the home team's players and fans were celebrating together in rapturous joy over what had just happened. Charlie Brown's reply? After a soft \\"oh,\\" he finished the strip with this line: \\"How did the other team feel?\\"Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful!","review":"I really like these, I had Bloch Pointe shoes at first, and I loved them. However, most everyone else in my class had Russian, so I wanted to test them out. I realized that the Russian pointe didn't have the extra padding that the Bloch had, and since I have thin toe pads, it made a difference. I looked online, and found these. I love them! They help a lot, and I don't hurt as badly. The only problems are that they get holes easily if you put them inside your toepad, which I did the first time because they are a little hard to position in your box if your hands are bigger than your box, which mine are, (although the holes don't make much of a difference in the padding), the sticky-ness on the end doesn't stick (but that might be better, that way if you put them in crooked or end up not liking them they aren't there forever), and they make the shoe a little tighter. But overall, I would say that these are awesome!

Rather, I was in search of a book on meditation. But there were so many too choose from. The only reason I chose Mindfulness in Plain English is because it didn't have the word \\"meditation\\" in the title. I was not disappointed by my choice. By the second time through it I realized the power and potential Buddhism and meditation practice and how they could lead to a more peaceful way of life.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about Buddhism in general and mindfulness meditation in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Absolutely the best book I have ever read and studied.

I do not believe in chakras, yogic flying, psychic visions or tantric orgasm. I have a western scientific mind, and a very short patience for BS.I loved this book.Mindfulness in Plain English is a meditation manual that's been brutally stripped of superstitious hokus pokus. It's focused, straight-forward, practical, yet profound. It says what it means and it means what it says. And if you practice, really practice, you'll find the techniques it describes can honestly change your entire outlook on life in a frighteningly short period of time.If you're a skeptic, and you're interested in meditation as a psychological exercise rather than a mystical mystery, you'll do well with this book. If you need your chakras petted, look at any of its 10,000,000 lesser competitors in your local flaky pseudo-eastern bookshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Insight","review":"This is a very important book. Very insightful, informative, & at times humorous. Gunaratana walks the razor's edge between explaining & brief clarity, giving just enough to provide a firm practical foundation. He touches on a sketch of orienting theory lightly enough to provide context without getting too deeply entrenched in Buddhist culture so as to distract from the method & its application possibilities. The wording seems effortlessly Western & familiar. It certainly encourages an easy & fruitful beginning insight meditation & universal friendliness practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power of Simplicity","review":"The problem with most books on Meditation is that the language they use to describe meditation destroys mindfulness. This book is easy to follow without sacrificing content, which I think is amazing. It doesn't place unnecessary emphasis like other books I have read on citing more credible sources or logically debating truths (which is absolutely useless to the practice of meditation), it simply shows you the path. It is the perfect meditator's handbook, and I would recomend it to anyone I know, meditator or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding my Mindfullness","review":"Using simple language that anyone can understand, this book helps explain, define,and bring acute awareness about meditation. It is practical and helps the reader to understand that meditation can bring one to a level of peace and tranquility with their space in this place called Life.

Somewhere along the way, this author missed some very important lessons about Buddhism, or belongs to a dogmatic tradition, as far as I can see. I'd opt for the insight meditation kit offered here on Amazon or look for another book, to be honest. This author does not impress me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard, no fun!","review":"My expectations were very high given the reviews.However, I was quite disappointed by this book.It makes mindfullness and meditation seem too difficult and much like a chore.Especially since its called \\"in plain english\\", you would think it would be more accessible for beginners.It repeatedly talks about how mindfullness is difficult, hard work, etc...I disagree.If you want a very accessible book about mindfullness, try Eckhart Tolle's book \\"The Power of Now\\".You might also try \\"A New Earth\\" by Tolle, or one of Jon Kabat Zinn's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A need to own book.","review":"This Book is another must have. It is (in plain english) a insight meditation manual to help the beginner learn and the experienced meditator to review. There is real world advice and explainations that will greatly help you understand how to learn meditation. Though no book can replace a caring and experienced teacher this book can certainly improve your understanding. Also the Book Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness and The Four Foundations of Mindfullness go hand in hand with this one and I reccomend getting all there in order to have a much wider view of the practice. I am truly thankful to Bhante Henepola Gunaratana for writing such a life changing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for anyone starting out in meditation","review":"I would recommend mindfulness in plain English anyone starting out in meditation it answers all the typical questions that the beginner might have, you can use this book without a teacher to get started on meditation.

This was not the case with Iron Sky. There wasn't much sci-fi to the movie. There was no comedy that I could discern. The acting was bland and pointless. There was no plot. I guess I just didn't get it.After seeing Iron Sky I wasn't planning on wasting a lot of time on Star Wreak. I watched about 20 minutes of it, reading the subtitles, and I could see that this was more of the same so it too was tossed in the trash.Hollywood is often criticized but watching movies like these make me appreciate the professionalism of the acting and directing of American-made movies.

Our overall feel for this style of trading is that it could work with proper money management and proper filtering. In fact it has to work with proper filtering in an up market because experience tells us that trends experience pull backs and this books contains setups that will get you in to potentially large moves. Perhaps a filter looking for accumulation in the NASDAQ 100 or the S&P 500 would bring solid returns.

Sometimes they will transfer your call to 'Level 2' Consumer Relations, at times they refuse. Their response is always 'part will be shipped in 7-10 business days'. Four months later it is still the same excuse.Highly disappointed in Mitsubishi. What really upsets me is that the TV is for my elderly mother who is confined to the house and this wonderful product of theirs has been sitting in the living room inoperable for four months. There was no offer to replace the TV. This is how they treat their customers and the elderly. Will never buy Mitsubishi product again.Also, the menu is not user friendly.

But as well as the play \\"reads,\\" it is absolutely ELECTRIFYING when seen on stage -- as I found out just yesterday, when I saw a production of it. The actor who played Eddie Carbone, the protagonist, made the character very sympathetic; as a result, the play's ending was truly tragic.

It it because of his characters individuality that conflict and tension mounts. The relationships between the characters are tested and some form of problem occurs to highten the plot.

It also does not scroll reliably in all types of files. It's actually quite distracting when trying to do any work, so much so that I find it unusable.

If you have a tendency when relocating the mouse on the pad (like when you've gone all the way to one side of the pad but need the pointer to go over even further) if you drop the mouse just a little too harshly, I'm not even talking about hard, it will cause the middle scroll wheel button to activate (it doesn't click but it still activates). This matters if you've reassigned the wheel button to be a certain weapon or some action in a game it will cause the action to happen. I thought I had just abused the mouse so I got new one but it does the same thing. I can not believe nobody else has noticed this issue but I am now sick of this mouse and now need to get something else. I kind of noticed the issue at first but it took me a really long time to realize it wasn't me, it was the mouse causing it every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not usable: hair-trigger right click","review":"Bought this to replace an earlier Microsoft wired IntelliMouse Optical that had worked fine for about 8 years.

This never happened with my old mouse. I'm going to keep it because it basically works, but something's wrong with the design, and you may not like it. I'm not a gamer, just using it for normal desktop use.Updated review, 1 Nov 2010: Couldn't stand it, bought the good old Microsoft Intellimouse Optical (the white one) to replace it.

Fits my hand perfectly even if you have medium sized hands. The side buttons do not get in the way and are easy to program for office work or FPS (first person shooters) and MMORPGS. The wheel does make a somewhat loud clacking noise when scrolling but unless you're really paying any attention to it you really won't notice it especially if you're a gamer. The best feature of this mouse is that it eliminates the necessity of having a mouse pad. You can use it on any surface and the pointer will not skip around. So far I've experienced no ghost moving (cord making the mouse move) infact I say the cord for this mouse is perfect. The cord does not make the mouse move on it's own if it's idle.I would actually give this mouse 4 1/2 stars only because of the clacking mouse wheel but overall I'm very happy with this mouse and I highly recommend this to anyone :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Rock's Finest Shines On","review":"One of the world's greatest guitarists for three or four years developed an intimate and powerful survey of his most impressive work in largely accoustic format in a series of concerts with his brother Tommy, Paul Bell, and then joined by two other brothers Mark and Mike.

While chuckling at Gus's bureaucratic entanglements with his superiors, the reader gets a travelogue of Indonesian beaches and colorful details of Jakarta nightlife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling but Short","review":"The first half of this novel was absolutely amazing - as if I was magically transported to another entertaining world filled with great waves, crazy adventures, and sexy encounters with \\"professionals\\" and other mind-bending characters. Somehow, I think the Editor showed up on Nicholas' door right when the second half got underway because the pace hurried, the details were lost from the first half of the book, and the message and adventure got muddy.I definitely recommend the book - especially if you surf, you'll get charged by it - because of the great character portrayals, the comical situations, and the vivid imagery.

David Porter takes the listeners through his heart-felt love story of a man in love with another man's woman. This album preceeded all the skits that have become popular in most rap albums. If you listen to \\"The Masquerade is Over\\" you can hear where rappers such as LL Cool J, The RZA, Biggie Smalls (Who shot ya) and Prince Paul all sampled Porter's Memphis String's sound.

Even the general plot is fairly juvenile, obviously targeted towards teen-aged males. And what better way to sell cigarettes to teenagers than to advertise smoking in a sci-fi novel targeted towards teenaged boys? This book must have been paid for by the tobacco industry, as there is a sheer ridiculous amount of chain smoking involved (nearly on every page).Zelazny didn't put much thought into the post-apocalyptic plot, besides the lame midwestern monsters. There seems to be ample cigarettes in an America in economic collapse, as is there plenty of coffee and other items difficult to obtain (eggs, meat, etc). In my opinion, this book was just one big tobacco advertisement with little or no imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"good story, classic","review":"I read this book after watching the movie as a kid, and reading all the bad reviews.

The episodes used to be so creative, now just about every episode has Plankton doin' his thing. Its getting boring. There was like... 2 Plankton episodes in Season 1... Now its just about every other episode. SpongeBob is INFURIATINGLY annoying, Patrick is RIDICULOUSLY stupid, Squidward is TERRIBLY irritable, and Mr. Krabs is SUCH a greedy bastard.

I found it to be a griping somehow not trite quick paced fantasy.That said, I was quite surprised to find zero mention of Princess Julia in either of the reviews, or the book blurb. Based on the reviews, a reader would be left with the erroneous impression that Prince Rupert saves the world all by his lonesome, and that Julia just does some tasteful swooning as needed. Rest assured Fisher fans, Princess Julia is anything but tame and ladylike, and she is by no means forgettable. In many ways she just doesn't steal the show, she is the show.So, for those of you who, like me, read the Hawk and Fisher books because you like Fisher, don't be fooled by these reviews.

Instead of a malevolent sorcerer cackling in his tower, the people of the Forest Land face a force of nature, and like all forces of nature this is something that cannot bestopped by conventional means.

Human nature. He takes great ideas, seemingly stealing them from other people, puts them down with a lot of flashes, gore, and catch-phrases -- and we the readers are supposed to squeal.Example? When a boy is hit and bruised repeatedly by a girl he's pursuing, he backs off. He doesn't smile and go after her again.This writer knows flash, but he doesn't know people.

I have to say this book is great, both as prequel and as a stand alone story. It is an interesting take on prince rescuing the princess, quite diffrent than what would be normally be expected in such a story, and well worth your time. It has definitely stayed in my reread list over the years.

I have to say this is one of my favourite fantasy books of all time. The irony and sarcasm is mixed very effectively with the usual, expected plot elements in a fantasy story. It shows unusual depth and ingenuity in its characterisations, creating a world where there are no real heroes, and the people who look like they could actually rescue the world turn out to be ... somewhat less than expected. (Interesting twist to Tolkien's \\"Dark Tower\\" theme.) I would love to get a hold of this book ... I think I've read it about 5 times.

It is a fairly standard story at its heart - the inhabitants of the Forest Kingdom battle (and battle and battle) as they and their land are being engulfed by the Darkwood (your typical light against the dark, good versus evil shtick). The \\"light against the dark\\" theme is used quite regularly in the fantasy genre and is okay in the hands of a good story-teller who can put a twist of originality on the tale, but I don't think Simon Green achieves that here at all. In fact this story is just overstuffed with an unrelenting and forced melodrama. Also, for all of its gory demon-slaughtering the author chooses an otherwise incongruously light-hearted approach to the story. The dialogue is sappy and syrupy to the point of annoyance. I find it hard to believe that most sci-fantasy veterans would find it very rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awesome","review":"This book is one of my favorites.

The melodic metal they made will posses you. Difficult solos and fast songs show you the best heavy metal in the world. Really. It's amazing. The last song is the best cover I ever heard.

Sister Midnight is the sequel to Reed's novel The Pleasure Chateau, the latter being one of the few erotic novels to combine the worst elements of Anne Rice's unreadable Sleeping Beauty books with those of the \\"naughty\\" novels of J.

I do like the album. Disc 1 sounds very much like listening to Bedrock/Digweed album (quite repetitive, slow-paced and \\"dark\\"), but disc 2 picks up the tempo with more progressive house/ more danceable tracks. I really think Timo Maas is an amazing DJ, but, I feel \\"Connected\\" fell short of showing off his full potential. He doesn't stick enough to his signature style like you hear in Dooms Night or Star 69 remixes. DJ Icey's Essential Mix is a prime example of sticking to method/signature sound.

I have always loved the classic Doctor Zhivago. My mother actually named me after Lara. As much as I loved the original, Keira Knightly and Hans Matheson give the characters a whole dimension. Their tormented romance is heart wrenching at times and romantic and uplifting at others. They share a passion so strong, you can't even blame Zhivago for succumbing to it despite the fact that he is a married man. They are both artists and serve as each others muses as well as lovers. The scenery and costumes also add to the realism of this mini series. They set the scene of a war torn Russia that makes you feel like you stepped through time to witness the events first hand.

I found the young cast to be exceptionally strong and skilled, especially Sam Neill in his portrayal of \\"Kamarovsky\\"; however, I was very disappointed with important changes: the father's death and funeral scenes completely lacked the impact of the original movie, where the mother's burial view from her coffin, beautifully yet eerily remote from the winter storm above, was riveting; likewise the spring Varykino was not the lovely ice palace of the original film.

For example, nothing in the hospital scenes gave me any sense of any real emotion/love growing between them. A few scenes of them together and that whole part of the story was over.

It's a dark story of madness, murder, and voodoo. It's also infused with Howard's southern fascination with the tense and frequently conflicted relations between blacks and whites in the early 20th century American south.Anyone who appreciates Howard's writing will surely enjoy this story.

This isn't great. The installation was simple, just pop a disc into the cd player and follow the directions. After you plug the USB cord in it seems so wonderfully easy, until you have to try and fit it onto your lid. My computer is an Alienware and I never really took notice to the curved and deep lid until this Lifecam wouldn't stay on. I finally finangled the dang thing so it would stay, but unless you actually have a squared off, 90 degree angle flat lid, it's not going to stay well.The picure is just a problem. 20% of the time it worked, the rest was colorful snow. Plus the microphone doesn't work unless you are within a foot of it so I would humbly suggest you get a different product. But I must say, having a sliding camera lens to shut it off and turn it on is awesome... the only awesome thing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work with MS Vista","review":"Eventhough this webcam is sold as being certified to work with MicroSoft Vista, it DOES NOT.

The picture is incredibly sharp. I was able to see my bird walking around on the floor of the living room in detail. Installation was easy and my computer didn't choke on it once! It installs Windows Live which you don't really need to make it work, so unless you like this overinflated software for messaging, I wouldn't chose the option to install it with the camera driver. The clip part that is supposed to fit on the top of your laptop didn't fit mine very well, so that was a bust. And positioning the thing so that it's stable and at an aesthetically pleasing angle took a little finagling.

The software installation failed numerous times. Finally, after about eight attempts, I read on a help website to reinstall Logitech cam drivers as I had previously installed a Logitech webcam. That and a download of the Lifecam v.1.3 software finally did the trick. I used the cam 48 hours before my system started inexplicably crashing with strange error messages. After several hours on the phone with Dell support and allowing them remote access to my computer, they determined the entire Windows O/S had to be reinstalled, and they faulted the cam for all the problems. I cannot recommend strongly enough AGAINST buying this webcam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design / complicated installation","review":"I needed a webcam pretty much right away so headed down to best possible and got the unit for $100 plus tax. It was probably worth it since I saved myself the shipping for the return.For starters I want to say I am not a Microsoft hater, actually I bought the unit thinking I would get better quality and support. What I found out is that the webcam is pretty useless if you have an IBM Thinkpad since the clip is not adjustable, in fact preventing you from mounting the web cam on your screen display.The install seems complicated, you need to download and install MS Live messenger before proceeding with the actual hardware installation.Based on my findings the NX-6000 is not worth the steep price considering the complex installation and the inability to adjust the clip for a given laptop.

Also comes with nice Microsoft Live Cam software for zooming and other adjustments.One caveat: Its approx. 1/4\\" built-in mounting clip doesn't grip onto the top of my laptop due to the thickness of the monitor portion of my particular laptop model. The ad photos for the cam made it seem otherwise. It is stable however hanging at the top of my monitor, simply laying against a hook on my monitor.

Little Men is in no way as good as Little Women, though it is a good sturdy children's classic.In Jo's Boys, the story is finished out. The boys mature and we learn what happens to them. Some fare well, others don't prosper. This is what makes Jo's Boy's somewhat somber in nature. Alcott notes the passing of Marmee, and others depart as well. A sadder tale, and a bittersweet end to the saga of the March family. A funny tidbit is the appearance of fans to bother Mother Bhaer (Jo). Alcott afflicts her alter-ego with the same annoyances that the fans created for her after Little Women. One uninvited admirer even cadges a postage stamp from her desk. A bit of real-life levity in an otherwise subdued book.Even if not up to Little Women's literary heights, Jo's Boys is a must-read if you want to know how it all turned out. (And who can resist that!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Ok","review":"Sure, this book tells the complete ending to Little Women and Little Men, but in most of the book, are boring parts. There's no action, or drama, or anything interesting in it. It just tells about the life at Plumfield, which can get REALLY BORING! If you want to read one of Louisa Alcott's books, I recommend Little Women, that was one of my favorite books that I have ever read. If you read it, watch the movie, it is AWESOME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine book, just not Alcott's best.","review":"This is a great children's books- I think it scores low with many Alcott readers however because although it is generally good, it is not GREAT like her other books.As the third of the \\"Little Women\\" books (1: \\"Little Women\\", 2: \\"Little Men\\"), \\"Jo's Boys\\" features the children of the original March sisters, now grown up themselves and having their own issues of romance and careers. The books of this series are all appropriate reading for young teens.Some people say the moralizing in this book is more than the others- but Alcott put a great deal of cautionary tales in all three. Still, a sweet story and anyone who has read the first two will definitely want to read the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"awe","review":"This being the conclusion to the March family sagas..i'm sorry to say didn't \\"thrill\\" me as much as the other two installments.

He knows, and relates, the history and recent political climates of the countries, islands, and areas he passes through on his round the world trip. He spends comparitively little time describing his trip and the people he meets aboard and ashore. When I picked up this book I expected some real escapism. To have my imagination transported to the far away places that I daydream about. Sub-titled, Around the World on a Tramp Steamer, I was ready to relax while I leaned on the starboard rail and watched the world go by. I was ready for adventure and unforgettable characters.

Many years ago I spent 3weeks on a tramp freighter travelling between Africa and North America. Because of my own experiences I really looked forward to reading this yarn and was extremely disappointed. There are meager descriptions of his own experiences and one gets the feeling that he (Mr. Fetherling) should have stayed home and spared us what I felt to be a chore in finishing this book. His ship docks at many exotic and alluring ports in the Pacific but amazingly he really has no adventurous experiences himself. He relies on others for his chronicles. Spare yourself the boredom and look for your sea tales elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Action Movie That I Am Very Pleased In Watching!!!","review":"... Well I finally got to see Bad Boys 2 a few weeks ago and I was very pleased. I can't wait for the dvd to come out.The movie is ACTION packed to say the least. There is action, brief nudity, a lot of cursing, violent and digusting killings, and a lot of drugs. It is not a kid's movie and I was disapointed to see how many people brought their kids with them to see this movie.Anyway, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a great team and yes their jokes were sometimes annoying and dry but not enough to be overshadowed by the really funny scenes. I liked the first Bad Boys film but I really feel that the sequel is much better.

Martin Lawrence gives his best performance ever. Seriously, this is the best he's done. Ever. This is it. Nothing better. And Will Smith? He steals scene after scene like he's Winona Ryder in an unguarded Saks 5th Ave. But the real star of this film is its director and auteur, Michael Bay. Never one to let plot, good dialogue, plausibility, logic, intelligence, strong acting performances get in the way of his vision, Michael Bay is a modern day Penny Marshall. A director so driven and ambitious, that his singularity of goal will confound your soul and leave you teetering on the brink of actually enjoying one of his films. And yes, you'll likely find yourself saying, \\"I paid $8.50 for that?\\" But upon further reflection you'll say, \\"Actually it was more like $20 after the diet fanta and the popcorn, snap!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Usually sequels offer more of the same, but this mean spirited cop buddy movie gone wrong offers less of the same. Less originality, less humor, and less ability to capture the audience's interest with anything other than big explosions. The stars are generally morally indistinguishable from the villains, and their only difference lies in the amount of ass-kicking of which they're capable. The plot unravels further when they go overseas to a central American country to stage an assault on a drug kingpin's palatial home. In the home, the toddler child of the drug dealer is whisked away to safety by a henchman. Then the henchman is shot, leaving the girl all alone.

Smith, however, remains reliable and more or less saves the day.The Plot? Oh, it's something to do with designer ecstasy and a major drugs war in downtown Miami in which the two narcotics detectives become more than usually involved when one of them falls for his partner's sister. Their personal relationship stretched to the limit creates danger for them in the face of massive mob action.

Also, I know that in this politicaly correct world, only white guys are supposed to be \\"racist\\", but in this movie, Martin Lawrance was the black version of the kkk.

Too much action, too many bad jokes, too much over-the-top shocks, and too much Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. After all, who would even pay attention to this movie were it not for the cars being blown up, people being killed in increasingly outlandish ways, dead bodies flying out of a morgue van, and immature sexual references? Martin Lawrence was a pest, Will Smith was average at best, and Michael Bay proves once again that he's a horrible director. There were one or two scenes that were mildly interesting or funny, but overall, you'd have to pay me to sit through this again. Another summer blockbuster/sequel that's not worth a viewing. You can't take anything in here seriously, and you can't really laugh at anything either. As a result, why bother?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More godawful than the first","review":"I remember watching the first bad boys a month or so ago and detesting it. When my friend was bugging me to watch this one I told him that, but he insisted that I'd like this one, and he was extremely wrong. This movie is needlessly long (2 and a half hours, at least bad boys 1 knew when to end), has a sickening amount of violence, and dirty jokes that are not funny, just disgusting, (I felt like gagging in a scene where you saw 2 rats having sex). The action scenes are well-filmed, but they're senseless and drag on and on, along with other pointless scenes from the movie).And I don't think the amount of lives these terrible officers saved by bringing down these ecstasy dealers can equal all the innocent civilians they killed in the process. People bash Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" for being too violent. That violence is realistic and authentic and it actually happened. If you want to criticize a movie for violence, attack this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"My husband and I loved the first Bad Boys movie and were looking forward to seeing part two. This movie is definitely an example of how sequals are never quite as good as the original. In this case it was no where near as good. My husband fell asleep halfway through the movie,which is a definite sign that the movie is not that good. The movie did have its funny moments but they were few and far between. The car chases were endless and the story dragged on for almost 2 and a half hours. Unless you just absolutely love any movie that Will Smith is in I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Boys 2 has just gone bad!","review":"I saw Bad Boys 2 over the summer and it was quite a traumatizing expierence. For real, the movie shot at me like a cannon. This sequel to the fun-filled original is loud,long, cramed with endless language and violence and did i mention long? The action sequences do look impressive but there are too many loud car crashes and bloodshed. In one huge scene, the police chase a cartel in the freeway and there's bodies and people dying.The filmmakers are absolute nuts! I'm speaking to u Jerry Buttheimer! Speaking of limbs, the morgue scene with Smith and Laurence picking out the dead's insides is outrageously disgusting.If this is your cup of tea have fun. as for me, im spending my time better in good use"},{"rating":"2","title":"right on target","review":"the product that i ordered was the product that i received. it was in perfect condition and arrived in good time.i will visit this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny and interesting as the first movie.","review":"It's ot as funny and interesting as the first movie.

Martin Lawrence's character is almost as annoying and Eddie Murphy as the ass in Shrek. I realize that this film is designed for the hyper-macho idiot - but the stupid homophobic dialogue is really unnecessary (even if it is embraced by it's audience). Even thought Will Smith's character is the Homophobe, he does come off as the Action Film Star and continue his success in this genre. The film has a great look to it, as some very nice camera work/ effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinosaurs that fly","review":"Another small film that is only entertaining and silly like a French cow with five legs. I must be scratching the bottom of the barrel or scraping the dust in an empty drawer. Speaking of drawers, you may lose yours if you watch too many of these films. Stunts and stunts again, and in between more stunts and so many nice houses that are blown up just like fancy models made of matchboxes and toothpicks. But it is funny because it never ends and they are cops. They disturb more collateral peace than any real war would do. But it is funny and definitely not too tiring for the mind, the brain, or what you may be using in the place of that in order to think about straight, crutches for example. Enjoy it and think you retired about twenty five years ago.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines, CEGID"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watcha' Gonna Do?","review":"Bad Boys II is an excellent action movie. I should warn you that it is not for kids. It contains lots of violence, profanity andlight nudity. They want to arrest a drug lord who has been difficult to get because the evidence is always missing. These two cops start investigating and find what they needed, lots of drugs and tons of laundered money. Better than the first \\"Bad Boys\\" movie, Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's characters do not bicker as much in this sequel. They are both funny and made me laugh out loud. But when it came to business, they were both hard-edged and deadly. They get involved in exciting shoot-outs with a high body count. The car chases have amazing stunt sequences, and crashes (especially the one on the freeway, DAMN! you just got to see it). My only gripe is that there is too much chaos and the camera bounces around. But if you want to see a good action flick, get Bad Boys II."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Boy, This Was Bad\\"","review":"Word of advice to Will, if your gonna make sequels, make one on \\"Ali\\" thats better than this honk of trash.

I watch movies for entertainment & comedies especially to laugh...& I did. I'm a fan of both Will Smith & Martin Lawrence & I'll watch most anything they're in. This movie was \\"sexier\\" than the first one [the guys looked hot!] & it surely has lots of male fantasy....things blowing up & shooting everywhere. That got a little old for me, but Smith & Lawerence kept me entertained with their chemistry. I bought the DVD & was disappointed not to find the director commentary. They do give some behind the scenes footage [like MTV making the video] but it's not the same. I love to hear the director talk about the particulars of a scene as I'm watching...it makes for great discussion. I probably wouldn't have purchased the DVD had I known there wasn't any director commentary like the first one. It's still an entertaining movie, but not as much as I hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This movie sucked. Plain and simple. If you are under the age of 25.

I really didn't believe that because I went see the first and it is OK. With movie technology improving these years, I thought how bad it gonna be? Well, if you got the same thought, better finish my review. \\"A lot blows and non-stop stupid jokes\\". That's what I heard from the critic during the interview of The Best Damn Sport Show. After I saw the movie, I realize there's no better way to describe this movie. I'm so glad that I didn't go to the movie theater and throw $12 away. To be honest, I do even want to see the second DVD which including deleted scenes and productions. A lot people mad about Matrix sequels, but if you want to see real good highway chasing, go to see Reloaded instead of Bad Boys.

I don't understand how all the reviews said this wasn't a good movie. I loved it. These 2 have great chemistry on scrren together and they are funny as s**t. I laughed hard as hell watching this and was on the edge of my seat the whole time. It is packed with action and jokes for the almost 2 and a half hours it runs. This time they are busting a huge ecstasy dealer and when he kidnaps Marcus' (Martin's) sister (who is also Mike's (Will Smith's) girlfriend) (and she was also working undercover for the DEA w/o them knowing at first) they have to go on an \\"off the books\\" mission to Cuba to rescue her and bring down the drug kingpin.

It has all the bad*** action, explosions, and slow motion you could want; along with some surprisingly funny humor.

Truly awful, derivative Hollywood mega-movie-sequel-itis dreck. I felt like I was watching an intellectual property / storyline rip-off of the superior Miami Vice. From drugs transported in corpses, to the inevitable showdown w/ the drug dealer on his home turf in Cuba, this film was just horrible and made one appreciate the Michael Mann's treatment the first time around in the early-80's. The ubiquitous Will Smith and his trademark smarminess are painful to watch, while sadly, Martin has to handle the straight guy role without much enthusiasm. After seeing grand cinema like the epic Return of the King, this just makes me groan.

Oh, my..and when the doctor at the seriously understaffed hospital offers cookies I about lost mine. And just who is the chick the cop is in bed with? And is his partner, Rachel, his wife? And what happens to her? The effects are ridiculous; the stuntman scarecrow's acrobatics are hilarious. There is no acting at all, and poor Tony Todd's presence does nothing to legitimize this awful (but awfully funny) travesty.

It looked like a horrible techno-rave scene by some guy trying to re-create a recent acid trip.I wouldn't recommend renting, or buying this film unless you want to have a brain aneurism.

But my god, what swine.\\"Poetry has the windfor a coat of arms, the windfor a coat of harms, the windfor a coat of charms.\\"(\\"Poetry Has the Wind\\")In some twisted way, I can see this book becoming a cult classic, elevating Lewin to the same status as the triumvirate of Horrible American Poets-Rod McKuen, Susan Polis Schutz, and Helen Steiner Rice.

There's at least a quarter inch, probably closer to three-eights between the paddle and case itself (I know my pants aren't that thick), plus no curvature at all to keep it close to my hip. Secondly, I ordered a size 4 for my HK USP magazines, and there is an excessive amount of play in the mag pouch, so much that if you're running, your mag is gonna come out.

It is written in the educated language of past generations (we had a immigrant pathologist in our laboratory recently who informed us he could not handle the English vocabulary and syntax that largely expired in the late twentieth century, which may explain the difficulty another reviewer had with this).Gustavus was admirable, to me, most of all for his Christian charity. His chief opponent, the count of Tilly - who had been responsible for the terrible massacres at Magdeburg and other cities in 1631 - was mortally wounded in early 1632. Gustavus sent his personal physician to Tilly in a vain attempt to save his life. (In contrast, when Gustavus lay wounded on the battlefield of Luetzen, Imperial soldiers, coming upon him, finished him with gunshots - as described in this short book and others, e.g., the Osprey series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Midnight Lion: Gustav Adolf - The Greatest Lutheran Layman","review":"I have read books that were written in a much clearer style (to say the least.)

It's the only one I can find online that has a strong suction to hold the item in place without being afraid it would drop; that has polycarbonate mirror which is 15x stronger than glass; and that has stainless steal rod which will last longer than those cheap chrome plated ones. For the price, it's all worth it! The carry case it comes with is not the prettiest nor the most sturdy but it'll do, to prevent scratches while travelling.

The music itself is somewhat mediocre, but not terrible. When you know where ideas were plucked from, th enjoyment level is severely marred. As an album, there's not much here that's knock your socks off. Just some average toons. It's probably most enjoyed by those who saw and had fun at the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw this on TV a few years ago","review":"I found that the dances were mesmerizing and the music invigorating.

It's such a unique, original and wonderful musical difficult to match with any other one. Variation is the word here: the music goes from classical themes (the \\"Did you move?\\" themes)to modern tunes in a most attractive manner. This is one of those CD's that you may play over and over again, and never get tired of it. I would highly recommend it to all music lovers, since the musical range is so wide that it will thrill all audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of songs!","review":"I honestly wish that I would have seen Contact before I bought this C.D. so that I would know how each of these brilliant songs fit in to the show. This is such an eclectic mix--from Mozart to the Beach Boys, from neo swing to songs that my parents danced to. Highlights include Boyd Gaines's 'You're Nobody Till Somebody Loves You,' the works of Stephane Grapelli, and Richard Palmer's 'Simply Irresistable.'

A Tony winner for pre-recorded music? What a mistake -- how it beat out the competition is behind me! Structured like \\"Fantasia\\" with disparate styles and music, it works better on stage. The CD comes off like a hodgepodge with no cohisive basis or connection to the other segments. Better to see it in the theatre -- or maybe on video, if there is to be one. The Lady in Yellow is so dynamic in person that I missed her listening to the music. And where is Van Morrison's \\"Moon Dance\\"? Overall, a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodge-podge ain't the half of it","review":"Love Stro (especially her work in The Producers), but who did she have to sleep with to get a Tony for this dreck???

As a CD this is Strictly Resistible.My copy of this CD went to Goodwill after one spin. At five bucks it'll be worth it, but not a penny more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hodge podge of music from an overrated show","review":"All the music here is pleasant enough, but it also shows how absolutely insignificant the show is. Critics raved about how Contact was the savior of musical theatre. Is this the emperor's new clothes? Obviously, those critics didn't pay ... a ticket for what was basically a mildly entertaining set of dance pieces that you might see on a television variety special.

I was very impressed with the sound. I wasn't looking for window rattling bass(but it does that also), I just wanted to feel it when the drummer hits it in rock music.

This version, however, was overacted (Other than Dr. McNeil's character which I still think was acted pretty well),and the characters didn't have the heart and spirit that they did in the book. The overacting and poorly done camera work make what is a great story seem hokey and dumbed down. Also many of the characters aren't very well cast either.

The original series' cast (Kellie Martin, Tyne Daly & Randall Batinkoff) were much more realistic & believable (the movies sometimes had over-acting... ah, what could have been!). All in all, perhaps 'newbies' could start with the series before seeing the movies. For Christy fans who have a hard time swallowing Smith's performance over Kellie Martin's (or Miss Alice & David), I'd think twice before buying the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christy - A Change of Seasons","review":"As I had watched the original series, the differences were very apparent in the change of actors, location and characters and even the theme of the story.

But even the weaker songs are still blessed by the extraordinary musicianship of the Staples. \\"Back Road into Town\\" is superb, though.

Pay particular attention to the last two songs \\"Man in the Street\\" and \\"Hometown\\", which are aabsolutely stellar.

My roommate and I had a lengthy discussion on whether this thinking is for everyone or limited to the intellectually and theologically interested - a first outcome of having read this book.

Walter Pidgeon shambles about as Liz's dad, Donna Reed looks pained and pinched as Liz's sister who sort of lost Van to Liz. Cloying child actress as the daughter of Van and Liz annoying.

Walter Pigeon appears as the eccentric father of the bride and Donna Reed is the older sister who tries to run the family with good sense and is often rebuffed.When everyone is poor and struggling things hold together but when the family falls into money then everything crashes down. The journalist proves he doesn't have the great American novel (or great Paris novel wither in him). Each struggles with problems and they slowly drift apart.

In contrast to the video quality, the audio quality is not bad at all. So yes, it does get a one-star demerit for not-so-great video editing, but is still well worth viewing and listening to. Sure, if there were numerous other Oliver Mtukudzi live-show DVDs out there, others might be worth considering first. But Oliver Mtukudzi DVDs are few and far between, so if you are at all interested in his truly fine music, this DVD is well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Philippine \\"Lodge committee\\" hearings","review":"The Philippine \\"Lodge committee\\" hearings (A.K.A.

Clarke and even a chapter on his visit to Grovers Mill where the people were friendly and didn't seem mad at him at all.Also the author uses fascinating data from 'The Invasion From Mars' by Hadley Cantril, a study of the psychology of panic, to help explain WHY the events unfolded as they did.

Portions of the book will make you gasp, as you read that some believed that only virgins could pick the tea leaves, since non-virgins would destroy the leaves by merely touching the leaves!Chatterjee's writing evokes the images of what it is like for these women who worked and continue to work on the tea plantations. Her research was extensive in the field. The book is historical, political, and analytical.

All the action is poorly done, and comes off even cheasier then it should. Most of the acting is horrible, and the story is bland. Nothing in this movie does what it should (hello it can't even keep its religions straight). I would say that it was because of a low budget, but the movie had $12,000,000. They could at least have made some of the fights look good, but sadly no. If you are in need of a good horror movie rent \\"Kolobos\\" or \\"Bloody Murder\\" (the latter is super cheesy and low budget but is way better then this movie). Try something else because this is a pretty lame movie.

Pavarotti is not exactly the best Radames ever, but his performance is no less than good. The problem is the production itself. The scenery has no charm, the triumphal march is NO triumpahl march, and the ballet scenes are just dreadful. All production is very amateur and it is amazing that such an important theater like the La Scalla was not able to bring us anything better than this. I do NOT recommend it to anyone, even if you are a great Aida fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A glorious high school production","review":"This production of Aida should, unlike small children, be heard but not seen. One imagines that, having paid for Mr. Pavorotti, La Scala had insufficient funds for sets and costumes. The triumphal march was a travesty. Glorious singing indeed, but I already have a wonderful CD; I was hoping for a fine, or at least good performance. Not here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pavarotti and Chiara in CONCERT!","review":"This is an incredible Aida for Luciano Pavarotti. I have never heard him in such a good voice for a dramatic tenor role.

This La Scala version is almost funny it's so bad. The singers just stand like statues staring at the conductor - not even an attempt to act the roles or relate to each other. The sets are comical and the costumes off someone's old rack. Unless you are a real fan of the cast members (Pav is in good voice doing his concert schitchk, arms outstreched, eyes closed & the usual \\"don't you just love me grin\\" on his face; Dimitrova stiffly swoops and screams her way through, eyes glued to the conductor; Chiara has poses and so-so voice with -0- emotion).

The color coded outlets and the tags for the plug cables are also a nice touch. The only issue I had was the attenuation of the broadcast signal from the antenna cable through the protection ports. Either the filter circuit or the antenna cable that came with the device attenuated the signal so that the new HDTV could not get a clear picture. My signal may not be super strong since it is from an antenna in my attic.

The unit has great specifications, I was most intrested in the filtered outlets (however they work) which is supposed to decrease signal noise in audio and video streams.Like someone else mentioned, it is built like a tank.

The monster unit burnt out recently which prompted me to look elsewhere since the monster unit smelled like it would have caught fire had I not been home to find it was broke. I've only had this for a couple of days but so far so good, and I've noticed an improved picture over the monster unit even. This unit is very heavy duty where the monster unit was lightweight and made of all plastic. Best of all is that this was way less expensive than the products I looked at locally and this seems to be top of the quality as far as how it's built.

The only complaint I have is that it has 3 working L.E.D's. Two of them are in green which means it's functioning properly and one of them (The gound ) is in red which leads you to believe that the outlet is not grounded properly.

From the episode where Barbara Jean gets set to mall jail for shoplifting in the church shop at the mall, to the episode where Reba is fired because \\"The policy of this school is that sex does not exist...the show presents many quality laugh out loud moments mainly from the raw feelings that still exist between Reba, Brock and Barbara Jean.

At least those had substance to them and had stars in them who could act and not overdo the slapstick. Reba McEntire is a talented singer but one thing she never should have done is go \\"hollywood\\". She should have taken advice from her good friend Vince Gill who knows his limitations and said that good people would not want to pay to see him act. Well we aren't paying to see McEntire act. We aren't paying for anything period...except what this show can do to our young people by causing them to go out and act in whatever way they please because, hey...its o.k....I'll support you anyway!! We're all survivors!! If it feels good, go ahead and do it!! That's the message I get from this DVD collection which I stupidly allowed my daughter to buy because she is a Reba fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE PROGRAM AND REBA IS NOT ANOTHER LUCY!!","review":"It is so like Reba McEntire to compare herself to Lucille Ball. Hah! This program is trashy, stupid and cheap. Apparently I am not the only one who wants decent family programming out there. I certainly will not find it with programs like \\"Reba\\". It is a terrible show with bad writing and acting. The 'glowing' reviews it receives here are for those who like \\"dysfunctionalism\\" and \\"immorality\\" glorified. That is what this show does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"I have watched a couple of Reba's episodes and I found them to be merely o.k. Not offensive, merely innocuous. So I decided to buy this DVD set (as I am a collector of TV series). To say that I am sorely disappointed is an understatement. McEntire knows how to milk an audience but her timing is drastically off which throws the rest of the cast playing off of her. The episodes are merely innocuous and harmless but definitely not the stuff that classics are made of."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SILLY, CHEAP PROGRAM WITH BAD ACTING AND PLOTS!","review":"A silly cheap program with bad acting and plots! This is the type of cheap program that WB continues to put out. Reba McEntire is no comedienne, much less an actress. The supporting cast is barely adequate but overshadowed by Reba's trying to outshine everyone the way she usually does. This DVD (which I did not buy, but rented from the video star) is good quality (meriting one star) but the show really is quite terrible!!

There are better sitcoms out there and this program certainly won't be in the list of \\"classics\\" when the history of television is accounted for. Reba McEntire is not a good actress. She's too actressy and too flamboyant in her portrayal which makes the people who play off of her look bad. The stories range from \\"fair\\" to \\"poorly executed\\". In all, there is nothing special about this show to make it stand out amongst the classic sitcoms of television history."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LAUGHED MY HEAD OFF!!","review":"Indeed, Ilaughed my head off at the antics portrayed in this stupid sitcom which stars Reba McEntire. I laughed at them, not because they were hilarious but because of the outstandingly, scathingly, bad acting and written plots that these actors are forced to endure with country prima donna Reba at the helm. She is so loud and boisterous, yells her lines as if she were projecting to the back row of a theatre instead of doing live on film acting. Her acting is questionable. Its uneven. ANd this makes the other actors look bad. I'd forget this sitcom. Its harmless but forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA NEEDS TO GIVE IT UP!!","review":"There is something about Reba McEntire that I find very arrogant and very, very annoying. Whenever I watch her in anything I cringe. This lame attempt at situation comedy is no exception. McEntire should stick to what she does best and that is singing \\"traditional country music\\". It is fine for people to expand their horizons but Reba seems to think she can be all things to all people. In so doing, she creates embarrassment for herself and those who have to play off of her. I bought this DVD set with an objective mind but I quickly grew tired of McEntire's annyoing mannerisms and her obvious attempts to be a \\"Lucy copycat\\" as other reviewers here have noted. The show itself is neither edifying or offensive. Its simply Reba McEntire who I can't take!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A MORE INANE, STUPID, SILLY","review":"and boisterous comedy has not been seen since the likes of \\"My MOther the Car\\".

Martina???","review":"They don't have to create a sitcom to make me laugh at country music divas over acting all over the place. The episode where Cheyenne (Reba's daughter) tells Reba that she's pregnant and Reba registers shock (for all of 20 seconds) then says...oh well...then the pregnancy becomes the joke of the entire season?? What kind of sitcom and message are we trying to impart here? All the show seems to do is tease the girl about being pregnant? And don't get me started on the ex-husband and his girlfriend with Reba trying to play go betweeen. How stupid is this??? This show is typical of today's society and its lax morals and standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA'S CONTRIBUTION TO BAD TV","review":"This program is another cheap exhibition of the Warner Bros. network.

It's not the Reba show that brings me such dissappointment, it's the attitudes of these people making remarks such as the Reba show is \\"Demoralizing\\" our nation. Grow up. The responsibility of raising children in this nation is not Reba McEntires, its the parents. I have two children ages 5 and 6, who also love this show, and they are very sensible kids who are way above their peers. I take responsibility for that, I dont hand it off to some tv show.

But it is strictly for McEntire fans. I purchased this collection at a \\"yard sale\\" for $5.00. I am appalled at what America has come to. Aren't there normal families anywhere anymore? To me this show is not one bit funny. It hurts me to see the wasteland that television has become because of sitcoms that reflect the downward trend society has taken. Sure, it may be about being able to cope in such a society, but how is this society going to change its attitudes and morals if shows like this are telling you its o.k. to live a life of upheaval. Its inspiring to survive in the midst of chaos, but we deal with enough of this in reality. We don't need it thrown in our face on television. It is better to have programs with functional families depicting truth and right in this life, not contention."},{"rating":"1","title":"SILLY PROGRAM, SILLY PLOTS, BAD ACTING!","review":"This program is silly, vapid and completely nonsensical! I won't let my kids watch it. I don't want them growing up thinking that all families are like this. As for the slapstick moments, Reba needs to stop acting like Lucille Ball. She can't pull it off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY WITH \\"LEAVE IT TO BEAVER\\"","review":"Give me \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" any day. \\"Reba\\" is simply a show to showcase \\"McEntire\\". The DVD set is handsomely produced but the show itself is quite depressing for me to watch. I prefer not to have \\"real life dysfunction\\" thrown in my face, not matter how well it is portrayed. Society is thinking that this is the norm....divorce, adultery, teen pregnancy. The previous reviewer wrote this is not \\"The Cleavers\\". Indeed. But at least when I watch \\"The Cleavers\\" I get good values and good moral lessons from an era when families were functional. We could have that again were it not for programs like \\"Reba\\" glamorizing dysfunction in a way that fits the standards of today's society. Needless to say, I didn't buy this DVD set. I rented it because I thought I would get good wholesome comedy. It has its moments but they are few. Reba McEntire needs to quit while she's ahead. Bottom line: this series is not for me.

I bought the DVD at Walmart because of the \\"rave reviews\\" it received here and I was extremely disappointed and outraged. This is my opinion only and I'm in the minority.

Whats worse is the episode after the baby is born and she's holding the baby and the lights dim to focus solely on her and she begins to lip synch (very badly I might add.....its true...watch it and see...) to a song. How cheesy can you get? A cheesy program for cheesy people!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY FACE IS RIGHT!","review":"Reba \\"Diva\\" McEntire does have a pretty face and can act too! I think she and Bert Lahr (The COwardly Lion) from the Wizard of Oz were separated at birth since they look alike and act alike with their constant mugging...especially when she says \\"Cheyenne, you BONEHEAD\\"! The most stupid episode is when B.J. and Brock (Reba's Ex) get married and at the end Reba starts singing a stupid Texas song and the audience applause reaction as if they were expecting her to sing. Reba (Bert Lahr) needs to quit while she's ahead."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE OF THE REASONS TV IS SUCH A WASTELAND!","review":"Warner Bros. TV shows are cheesy and this one is no exception. Reba McEntire's acting is as cheesy as it gets. I am a fan of her music but her foray into television is quite disappointing. Her over the top performing in every way is a distraction. This woman loves to draw attention to herself. I bought this DVD with high expectations but I was sorely disappointed. The plots are in need of greater scope and development and, as I said before, Reba could use a few acting lessons. The rest of the cast does o.k. but they could do better. I won't go as far as saying that the show is a major contributor to the Moral Decline of America, but to me, it is just another example of the wasteland television has become. I think Reba McEntire should stick to singing instead of acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM APPALLED!","review":"I am appalled. Because of the influence of this show, which I allowed my pre-adolescent daughter to buy, she now thinks there is nothing wrong with premarital sex and teenage pregnancy.

Not everyone is going to react the way Reba does....inviting the boyfriend to move in with the daughter and make it all fine and dandy with a bow on top. This is the type of impression that this program has made...a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHAMEFUL","review":"I DO NOT OWN THIS DVD BUT I DID WATCH ALL OF SEASON ONE AND PART OF SEASON TWO.

WHY WAS ADOPTION NEVER MENTIONED AS AN OPTION FOR THESE TWO CHILDREN? AND THAT IS WHAT THEY ARE CHILDREN! THIS SHOW MAKES TEEN PREGNANCY AND MARRIAGE LOOK LIKE A GOOD IDEA INSTEAD OF SHOWING TEENS AND THEIR PARENTS THAT THEIR BEST OPTION IN THIS SITUATION IS ADOPTION, NOT TEEN MARRIAGE AND LIVING WITH MAMA WHILE YOU FINISH HIGHSCHOOL, GO INTO LABOR DURING GRADUATION, AND THEN ATTEND COLLEGE WHILE YOUR INFANT IS STUCK IN DAY CARE ALL DAY.

The plot is see through, and the dialogue seems to have been stolen from every Navy SEAL book they can find (more SEAL cliches than WWII movies). Sheen is as transparent as usual in the over-the-top 'badboy' SEAL, who any commander worth anything would have kicked off the Teams. Micheal Biehn and Bill Paxton (who only had a small part) are both excellent actors who just picked a bad movie (Biehn's SEAL role in The Rock is a much better portrayal).

When i saw this movie for the first time i didn't even know anything about the Navy Seals. After watching this movie i considered the Navy Seals the n1 Special Force arround the world.For about 120min you will see some awsome action, and you will see a bit of each aspects of a Navy Seal (Sea / Air / Land).Conclusion:If you want an exact documentary about the Navy Seals, try and grab a National Geographic DVD, maby you will find something there of value...Otherwise if you want a very very good entertaining action movie this is it !DVD downsides:It could have a little bit more of extras...

As if \\"Navy Seals\\" wasn't bad enough, he followed it with \\"The Rookie\\", another brainless action flick that both he and director/co-star Clint Eastwood would like to forget. But of the two, I'd have to say that \\"Navy Seals\\" is worse. Overflowing with cornball dialogue, stupid action scenes and MTV filler (remember that golf-cart chase set to music?), this movie was made for a twelve-year-old.

Its starts off with quite a bit of intensity as it performs an introduction of the people in the team and the true nature of there missions , it also shows there dedication and amazing skill and all that in just the introduction. This film focuses allot on the characters and the trust between team mates, it also explains the life of a seal pretty well and the ups and downs of being in the seals, and there responsibility in missions. I think anyone who sees this film will be impressed with the realism especially that in the missions as there real extremes are shown. Overall the mission scenes are very realistic, and Charlie Sheen is the craziest in the team, the only down side I think there is, is that there isn't enough emphasis on just how amazingly hard it is it is to get into the seals and just how tough you have to be, otherwise its a well made seals film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Military Channel documentary DVD","review":"Although assured by the Military Channel and Discovery Channel that this DVD was the program I was looking to purchase (program aired on Military Channel as \\"Secrets of the Navy Seals\\"), this was not the correct program and a complete waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"i returned these","review":"when watching a movie and you want surround sound you shouldn't be distracted by the speakers cutting on and off every time the movie goes to one of those silent scenes. i was disappointed by this. not to mention the fact that i was getting static on one of my speakers even though the speaker was only 10 feet away from the antenna and the box said it has a range of up to 300 feet. to redeem this product, at higher volumes it does a pretty good job. you don't need to worry about tripping over wires. but if you are like me and want great sound at all volumes of the movie buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 being the Best","review":"When all your other CD's hide you know that you have a classic on the stereo.The Black Halos second CD is tighter than their first.

Reading it, I was struck by the profundity of the advice on writing he gave his daughter Scottie, which is copied in excerpts. I felt like I was getting the same benefits he gave her, and I also got the sense that he would want this. He meant what he had learned to be accessable to everyone; in a way, it was what his life was based around. Then, I got a good deal out of the analyses the biographer devotes to transcibing the process Fitzgerald went through in mapping out each of his extaordinary novels- I took notes I'll keep for ever.

Of course Victoria sacrifices everything to do this because even if she can save him, he may not want to come forward in time to be with her, and even if he did he may not remember her or the love that they shared while he was a ghost.This is a beautifully written love story with great supporting cast.

It saddens me actually to see such a great story as presented in the comic twisted in this way.The acting is less than interesting, the only redeeming feature I found to this move was having Jeffery Coombs in it. For anyone that's a J.C fan he once again presents a character that is subtle and shakey, and yet just horrifying in his insanity. You got to love the guy. In addition, Isabel Brook ( Jane) has great legs, and we get to see them a lot.Aside from these two points, I left the credits feeling very disappointed. I agree with a reviewer above that the comic should have been much more in the way of it's sexuality ( at least a light X ) and the drizzling insanity of Jasper should have been delved into much deeper. I wouldn't buy it.And for gosh sakes, they don't even have Jasper quoting or singing 'Papa Has a Brand New Bag'. That was Jasper's trademark in the comic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it's bad...but the comic book is MUCH better!","review":"Yes, it's true: this movie is terribly made. And like most everyone else here is saying, I agree that it's not worth watching or renting. Even reading the comic book before seeing this movie doesn't help, because it's so far removed from the book that it's insulting.I can understand that in an hour and a half film it's not possible to capture the entire comic book (it would really take a mini-series to do it properly or at least a 2-hour epic with a Frank Miller (\\"Sin City\\", \\"300\\") budget), but they did things that weren't even in the comic book; things that make the comic book so great.I definitely wouldn't use this movie to judge the comic book.

The plot is jibberish. The acting non-existant. The special effects laughable. The action still-lifed. Ranks up there with CAPTAIN AMERICA for worst comic book movie of all time.

Second, let's correct all the self-righteous fools in some of the other reviews...Quinn and Vigil created the Faust comic series LONG before Todd McSellout created Spawn. That being said, the character's appearance is clearly a rip-off of Marvel's Wolverine (created in the 70s). Now for the film...well, there is nothing to really say...it sucks. It very well could be the worst film ever made. Nope, no exaggeration, it could be THE WORST. It is a TRUE SHAME that this schlock will be forever paired with what was one of the best, most brutal comic book series' ever produced (however, it too even went through a couple different distributors before the series was completed YEARS behind schedule).

If you're looking for laughter, you won't find it here either. This film is a mixture of all the worst parts of Wishmaster, X-Men's Wolverine character, Freddy Cruger's worst one liners.

Can Jenny's feelings for Jared overcome her doubts brought on by her friends' accusations?\\"Too Hot to Handle\\" is a passionate book. It's not only about Jenny and Jared, but also about Jared's old flames,who pick up their lives from the smothering ashes and move on to light other fires.\\"Too Hot to Handle\\" is another great book by Ms. Jackson.

I did not like this picture. And, the message, if in fact there really was one here was simplistic. Everything about the movie was utterly predictable, the love story, the powerful landowners wanting to push out the religious pacifists. These greedy murderous bullies pull pretty much every dastardly act during the duration of this movie---and of course, they get their just desserts. But, having both main characters emerge from critical injuries which the town doctor (David Carradine) says they cannot survive seems a bit much. But, in this movie, love triumphs over greediness and religious fundamentalism. It is also sad to see both David and Keith Carradine in such meaningless roles. But, then, they never have been big stars, so I guess it is necessary to get work when you can. As Naomi Watts' star soars, I cannot imagine this film being much of the springboard to her apparent stardom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfying","review":"Not much more I can say about this romantic western.

Problematically, she judges those who have much more serious habits. Hmmm...Perhaps others are more prone to addiction? She grew up economically priveleged.

But by the middle (h-see home) you could predicate that she would end up (u-see underground), \`discussing, me, me, me, and how now-a-days the underground scene is not really underground and TV is boring pop culture for those who refuse to take themselves too seriously (t-try it!). Well I'm also around 40 and was cool in my day but really what do we 40 yr olds know about the 'real' underground scene today. I remember the few 40 yr olds that hung around the scene when I was cool and now I know just how boring it would be to be 40 in an underground scene. Girl grow up!

Heck, I didn't know you can sniff it. And, according to the author, it's not very dangerous. Quitting entails little more than the equivalent of a really bad case of the flu.I tried it. It's not as she describes. Not at all. It's been a while since I read it, and I must admit, I remember very little about it. Which speaks more to its content than to my memory. Very little humanity, heart, all the good stuff we're looking for in books, art, and life. I actually do feel sorry for the author.

Opiates are hugely addicting and Her writing reminds me of Vincent Vega (John Travolta's Pulp Fiction Role). We see Vega Shooting up heroin and then cruising down the street with a huge smile on his face. Makes it look quite cool. I cannot tell you the countless lives I have seen ruined by this vicious drug. ANY writing that sheds a positive (Or in Marlowes case, A manageable) light on Heroin use is sad. Simply sad.

I can say that I pretty much am satisfied with what I have heard. Having a male/female duo on every song is a unique twist to the ghetto love r&b genre, and most of the songs use that gimmick pretty effectively, such as Chick on da Side and Fingerpointing. Some of the lyrics to the songs made me think of a Jenny Jones or Ricki Lake episode, however. Be in the mood for \\"ghetto hymns\\" or you may be disappointed. If you are looking for a fun cd that you can jam to and laugh at simultaneously, this may be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koffee Brown Is Tasty","review":"Koffee Brown's debut is definetly worth the buy.

Some tracks aren't age appropriate for kids though! While no where near as raunchy as many rap albums of today or R & B singers as R.

As for those who don't find this book inspiring...maybe we didn't read the same book. I found it completely inspirational and satisfying. A question I have for the scholar who disapproves of the book: Is this an error filled book? It seemed pretty well sourced. I am no scholar, but what I do know is this: It's good to know that such a magnificent work was brought about by a regular person, albeit a person chosen of god.

For members of LDS Church, this will likely be the go to book on much of the foundations of Joseph Smith's life, personal philosophy, organizational and religious thought. I don't recommend this as your first biography of the man, it is still very worthwhile to read Donna Hill's biography of the prophet to get a chronological perspective on his life before tackling this opus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult Read, but Very Enlightening","review":"I am LDS. A big Joseph Smith Fan. The book was a difficult read for many of the chapters. Still the book was very insightful of Joseph's day and the cultural setting his life was lived in. It clearly demonstrated how imperfect of a man he was but how he truley was a mouth-piece of God the Father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good history; Poor biography","review":"Historian Richard Bushman has written a detailed, objective account of Joseph Smith and his times. But to what end? Can any history of a person claiming direct communication with the Divine be \\"objective\\"? Indeed, should it? The revelatory experiences Joseph Smith claimed to have had either happened or they did not. If Joseph's accounts were true, of what relevance is it that other individuals in his age also claimed revelations? If God actually instructed Joseph Smith to engage in polygamy, of what relevance is it other charismatic leaders were preaching free love? If Joseph Smith or his associates somehow concocted volumes of fake scripture, it is of no more importance to me than Mark Hoffman's works -- interesting, but worthless.Richard Bushman tells an interesting -- perhaps even excellent -- history of the man Joseph Smith and his times. Unfortunately, his is not an especially useful approach for understanding the character and calling of a prophet of God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research","review":"The book states: \\"For instance, contrary to the 'First Vision' account, there were no religious revivals in Palmyra, NY in 1820 \\"I am not surprised. Joseph Smith lived in Manchester, New York at the time of the revivals. If this is any indication of their research, the book must be seriously flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An extremely scholarly 500+ pg book on the 19th century's most contreversial religious figure","review":"If you expect to read this book in less than two weeks, you're dreaming. This book is so-information filled that it will have you rereading paragraphs left and right. I usually read 100 pages of a book every day, but when I first got this whopper, and read 100 pages, I literally spent 3 or 4 hours. I've gotten 300 pages in, and I finally decided that I will use this book for reference only, because it is so overloaded with information, that it is almost not enjoyable for pleasurable reading; this book should mostly be used for reports, essays, or for hardcore history buffs.Overall, it is not Mr. Bushman's fault that the slow, factual pace is too overwhelming for me. I highly recommend this book if you need to know A LOT about Joseph Smith (this is probably the most in-depth biography I've ever read), but if you only need to know an overall history, just read shorter biographies or Wikipedia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative","review":"A very informative, enlightening book on Mormon history and it's founder.

Mr. Bushman presents the point of view from LDS church history along with extensive outside references and notes the prevailing criticisms.

Whether you're an ardent student of American History, a devot Mormon looking to discover more about our founding Prophet, or simply a curious (albeit more serious than most) by-stander who wants to learn more about Joseph Smith, Rough Stone Rolling is a must read. Like any large organization, the LDS Church tends to emphasize the highlights of Joseph Smith's life and de-emphasize his warts and frailties. However, Richard Bushman's research has made Joseph Smith more approachable. Joseph Smith was a man. Plain and simple.As a man, Jospeh followed his spiritual promptings and became the Prophet-founder of a worldwide religion, whose followers number more than 13 million. However, he put his pants on one leg at a time ... just like you and me.A little dense for the casual reader; but nonetheless accessable to nearly every semi-serious student of American history or Mormonism."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a man!","review":"There are many interesting details of the prophet's life that I didn't know before. It was interesting to learn about the time in which he lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Insight!","review":"As an active member of the LDS Faith I've often wondered exactly what the Prophet was like. Richard Bushman brightens the dark shadows of the Prophet's life and chips away the rough edges of Joseph's history, which has been viewed and clouded from many different angles. As Bushman states in the prologue, too often people try to protect the image of Joseph in effect almost Deifying him. This has lead to a common misconception that Latter-Day Saints worship Joseph. Through Bushman's abrupt honesty Joseph is honored and the work that he performed is made more miraculous. As one of the most important American and World religious minds it is important to understand how his religious philosophy was created. It is also important to know the man behind the philosophy. Here Joseph's flaws are presented concurrently along side his qualities. Finally we have a glimpse of this Moses-like prophet went through as he grew from poor farm boy to religious giant.

It's not a Japanese 101 book, more 102.This is a bigger, thicker book with tons of reading practice on each page. You definitely get your money's worth.The typical audience for this book would be someone who has had a Japanese conversation class and learned some grammar. Then they can pick up this book and become strong in their reading skill.It's an older book and has a few idiosyncrasies. It uses a weird form of romaji. It calls kanji \\"kanzi.\\" It says the character for shi is pronounced 'si'. But these are minor things that you will easily overlook if you know even just a little Japanese already. It's the Japanese readings that you care about here anyway.There is apparently a Beginning Japanese Part 1 book that is supposed to go with this book, but I can't find that on Amazon.

It has tons of practice exercised, it uses the kanji you already know, it has a great formula for learning kanji, blah blah blah. But I could never get over the pronunciations, they are so frustrating. I can't tell you how aggravating it is to try and figure out the pronunciation of a kanji when you have to decode the authors pronunciation. And it's not just the \\"ti\\"s being \\"chi\\", it's the \\"tsu\\"s being \\"tu\\"s, and the \\"ji\\"s being \\"zi\\"s, and the lines over the letters and all of this would have been fine if they just gave the kana next to the pronunciation garble. Not to mention the book is 34 years old. I don't want to say this is a bad book because it has a lot of good parts in it but I can't in good conscience give this book a good rating.

Not sure about long-term stability though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good reference","review":"I liked this book and will use it as a reference. Would definitely consider reading more books by Nancy Kress."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing and self-indulgent... what we like about Sparks","review":"Sparks' reworking of their own material as a tribute to themselves... classic Sparks mentality, I'd say. Some of the versions fall pretty flat because of the attempt to parody otherwise perfectly acceptable pop songs. The version of \\"Popularity\\" on this collection, though, is worth the price of admission altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"The classics are 'improved'","review":"A 'must' have disc for true fans. This disc shows the real genius (both lyrical and muscially) of the Mael brothers. Symphonic versions of their classic tracks (This Town..., #1 Song in Heaven) add another dimensions to the muscial side of Sparks. However, i feel some tracks (Angst In My Pants, Popularity, and #1 Song...) redone with a dance feel were a waste of time. The reworking of the original wasn't worth the effort and added little to the interpretation of the song. Still, a must have for the true fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and drawn out","review":"I have read many books and of all the books I have read I have only left 1 unfinished. This will be my 2nd. I am 200 pages in and will not waste my time finishing it. The last one hundred pages have been the same as the first one hundred, with the authors reiterating what they already stated. The book was boring and drawn out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks unbiased reporting","review":"I read it cover to cover and back through again to find out why it was that I didn't like it. It's simple. The authors rely so heavily on the word of Flemmi, a mob \\"rat,\\" who felt abandoned by his FBI handlers after he was indicted, that I have a hard time lending any credence to what he says. For that matter, the authors hold such deep contempt for John Connolly that their reporting of \\"true\\" incidents seems terribly biased. I don't doubt that after all the court cases have made it through the system, they will right yet another book. I doubt they'll provide any further insight into this Boston scandal then they do in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont bother. what a bore","review":"This book could have been shortened to 50 pages. It was so redundant. The authors attempted (rather weakly) to create all this hype. I can summarize the book in a few sentences-- Mobsters and FBI agents conspire to commit crimes and cover up those crimes using the power of the FBI office. They get cocky, they get busted. Wow, end of story. And oh- paratroopers dont \\"storm the beaches\\" they \\"parachute\\" usually behind enemy lines to create shock and awe and disrupt the enemies supply lines. And what is a white shoe person anyway? If your'e going to write a crime novel, write a Donnie Brasco type novel, where the guy is really hanging with nads out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but more detail needed","review":"This book reads well and is interesting but the reader might want to have more info.The Government reform committee headed by Congress might want to investigate linkage between this case and Judge Sartorelli of Middlesex County, Massachusetts and also research agents Weafer and Driscoll and other Justice Dept personnel in Middlesex county of the 1960s/1970s, as many of the players here are located in Middlesex county."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the facts","review":"If you're going to read only one book on Whitey Bulger's and Stevie Flemmi's strangle hold on the Boston rackets, this is the one. The authors' investigative reporting goes deep, uncovering the gang's criminal activities as well as their unholy pact with the FBI. This book lacks the personal notes found in others written by various gang members, but it more than makes up for it with solid reporting that shows the scope and outrageousness of the gang's operations. My only criticism is that it could use an update covering what's happened to the major players since its publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble in the Bureau.","review":"In the summer of 1983 the FBI had a witness who was going to testify to a grand jury in Boston about some of the Bulger boys' shenanigans in connection with a business of the witness' in Southie. Somehow word of the witness got to the boys, and in the wee hours one morning he was taken from his home to an abandoned lot, where they did a mock execution and told him that if he testified they'd do him for real.The witness was a lot tougher than the boys thought (and didn't know that some of the FBI were on the boys' payroll). He called the FBI as soon as he got home. The feds picked up the chump who made the threat almost immediately -- the witness knew him, and his idea of trying to be hard to find was going to his mom's place on the cape.But it was a puzzle how word of the proposed grand jury testimony had gotten out.This book may explain why. It's a fascinating, and scary, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehash of old News Stories","review":"If you have read the news accounts over the last few years don't bother purchasing. The book appears to be all of the past Globe newspaper stories dressed up a little. The authors have obviously added detail of the FBI/ mobster relationships from the thousand of pages of court transcripts. However, there is little added that allows the reader to get a feel for the characters and the lives they led."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book-missing it's jacket","review":"This was a very interesting book, however I was disappointed that it came without the book jacket. Although I purchased it used, I planned to have it autographed by the author, so it was frustrating to not have it come with the jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Work of Fiction","review":"Although this book is an interesting read, keep in mind that there are two sides to every story. This one happens to be fiction. Being from the area and knowing how the 'world' works, please don't make up your mind about Agent Connoly based on this interpretation of some facts, some fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Code Red","review":"One might ask how many records were destroyed by officials in this case. Were Bulger and Flemmi monitored much more than the FBI alleges and this monitoring accounts for the 'pathological lying' of Bulger? Should controls be in place for ANY agency such that records can never be fully destroyed?Of even more concern is the integration of known organized crime elements into legitimate government agencies. Have all government agencies been penetrated by organized crime? Or are the most powerful elements within each agency in fact what we know as organized crime?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great True Crime","review":"Other reviewers really captured my sentiments. This is a heavily researched book with great local color and stories without the over-written narrative that often plagues such books. The authors do a splendid job of building a story of Boston and its characters from nothing and then drawing out broader implications. What a shame these events happened to such a great city through both criminals AND public servants."},{"rating":"2","title":"a boston vet in the know","review":"a must...this book is incredible..a page turner...the alliance between two (2) mobsters, one a serial killer, is compelling...the loyalty of the agents is challenged and the bad guys profer..what is great is that none of the names are changed..its all there...some may hide..but this cosiness between two killers and fbi agents will raise some eyebrows...a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Mass","review":"A riveting true life account of corruption over decades. Bone chilling when you recognize one of the characters in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book","review":"I've had an interest in Boston and the organized crime around Boston for a while. I've actually had a big interest in the mafia in general. This is a great book with a lot of information that is very useful in understanding how corruption in the system allows organized crime to become more powerful and almost unstoppable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put this one down!","review":"This is a wonderful account of the Boston underworld in the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. It is full of history and first hand accounts of Whitey Bulger, Stevie Flemmi, and the FBI's involvement and knowledge of their illegal wrong-doings. I would highly recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unresolved issues","review":"Did Whitey have any children that government agents, and not just the FBI, might have known about? Could Whitey have had a son who was made to suffer if Whitey didn't 'go along'? Kevin Weeks was supposed to be Whitey's 'surrogate son' could this truly have been the case because a real son might have been closely monitored? Could Condon,Rico, Connolly, etc have all known about it if that is true? Would such information be safe under Justice Dept officials? Could officials from other agencies have used children of the informants against them? How far would you go if someone was holding your son or daughter?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where does this end?","review":"John Connolly and Steve Flemmi shared an apartment or condo in Brighton,Mass. You have Kevin Weeks and John Martorano making deals while Flemmi and Bulger may be charged with the death penalty in Oklahoma and Florida. If any other government personnel have information that might clear Bulger and Flemmi, shouldn't they come forward? If they do not, aren't they permitting these two men to possibly be killed to save themselves? And how is it that individuals who actually perform murders get less penalty than those who are alleged to collaborate? A murder cannot be fulfilled if the hand designated to do it refuses to do so. Shouldn't more tip lines be opened up to compare information, rather than concentrating only in one place, where possibility of compromise exists?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro w/ intrigue","review":"This work is quite interesting but one thing i am concerned about is that there has not been hard proof that Whitey Bulger and Steve Flemmi actually performed any murders or organized them. Much of the case against Bulger and Flemmi seem to stem from testimony by persons trying to get out of serious culpability for what transpired.Kevin Weeks for example, who was groomed by Bulger and now is looking at serious prison time is cooperating with federal authorities in laying all the blame at Bulger and Flemmi's feet.We don't know right now who is actually responsible for what and it may be premature to pass judgement on Connolly,Bulger and Flemmi until all the facts,if ever,are in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting tale of some of the most embarrassing corruption in Boston","review":"Good story.

Based on extensive interviews and court case transcripts it's a sad but true accounting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myths of the Norsemen by Roger L. Green","review":"This book is an excellent introduction to Norse mythology for young readers. The individual myths are set down in a logical order so that the reader can understand the religious belief system of the ancient Norse people. I do not recommend this book to any adult who would enjoy a more in depth read on the subject; however, it would be a good read for an adult who just wants a quick and enjoyable overview of the subject.I wish more children of European ancestry would embrace their heritage and read up on the myths of their folk. We can all learn a lot about who we are by studying the beliefs that are actually native to our respective peoples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"It was not what I believed it to be.

It also has an important message about how young fawns hide in the woods until they are big and strong enough to follow their mothers.

Music that really sing about Love and Pain. Recommend it to anyone who knows the ups and downs of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what's pictured","review":"What is pictured is not what you get. Pictured is a DVT 1st stage, with a non-swivel 2nd stage Delta 4 (and exactly what I wanted as I'm trying to get away from swivels and the proprietary hoses that go with them). What I received, and what LeisurePro said is the only option for this Amazon listing, is a Non-DVT 1st stage with a swivel 2nd stage. Completely opposite of what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it from the get go.","review":"I'd never listened to W.C. Clark before, but was intrigued by a local newspaper review of this one. I bought it and loved it right off the bat. It is essentially up and has a great beat, but my favorite cut is the melancholy \\"Someday.\\" This CD is not strictly blues, but has a definite rock and roll flavor to it. Those of you familiar with Stevie Ray Vaughn might note some similar sounds here since Clark was one of Stevie Ray's influences. A bit more mellow though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy hounds, Batman!","review":"Phil Rickman is one of my favorite authors. His West Country mysteries, always with a generous sprinkle of English history, Celtic mysticism and superstition, never fail to captivate. Prayer is no exception. The Reverend Merrily Watkins is a winningly human sort of priest, with a neo-pagan daughter and a former rock star boyfriend. Supporting characters are equally well-drawn. While Rickman's plot this time round is quite complex, he moves it along at a fast pace, dropping clues to the reader if the reader's sharp enough to catch them. The surprises don't end till the very last page. If you think evil is an abstract concept, read one of Rickman's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read better, but not many","review":"Basic storyline is decent. Part one has the man hunters after Kyle and the last lantern ring and with some cool pictures it looks good. Part two brings the yellow ring into play. Given to a mental patient who can use it in ways never thought possible to \\"purge evil from the Earth.\\" With the help of other super heros (Alan Scott, Superman, Batman ect) it is a good story to help bring out the character in Kyle. All in all I like it and it's well worth a few days delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next writer, please.","review":"While I at first eagerly awaited Winick's arrival on a book I had been reading for some time, I found his Green Lantern simply bad. In our first issue, we are introduced to a variety of new supporting characters we don't care about. I didn't mind the new faces as much as I thought it was kind of forced on me. I also thought the character Nero was a hollow antagonist, and while a good effort to give Kyle an arch-nemesis, it just didn't work.On the other hand, the art is well done, and does much to solidify an otherwise weak story.Winick may have done great work in the world of personal drama, but it doesn't transfer into super-hero success. Next writer, please."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is HOT! Get it now!","review":"first off,...kyle rayner as green lantern ROCKS. ...i mean, hal jordan and all the other green lanterns were always cheap and just used the ring as a laser or a force field/shield. kyle has got all the creativity and fun and makes the coolest constructs from the ring. this book is packed with action (better than a movie). although its all one main story, there are three separate adventures. the first is about kyle getting abducted by the manhunters of qward. the second is about kyle dealing with fatality again (but this time she has a yellow lantern ring). and the third is about a schizofrenic artist called nero who inherits the yellow lantern ring and causes serious trouble. its a great buy and one of the best comics i've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"History treated like a heavy machinery operating manual","review":"This book is very well researched, but is EXTREMELY poorly written. It is the driest and most boring history book that I have ever read in my life. The entire thing is presented as a simple collection of facts and the author hardly gives you any insight into what the major characters were really like (sometimes you get a little glimpse in the footnotes). I bought this book after seeing all the good reviews it had gotten, but I have trouble focusing on reading for more than 10 minutes because I feel like I'm wasting my time reading this tedious amassment of factual evidence."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is House Committee on Un-American Activities","review":"All references to committees in the House are referred to as House Committees on whatever. It is not HUAC. It is HCUA. It changes the whole meaning it we continue to say House Un-American Activities Commitee. The House did not have an Un-American Activities Committee. The House had a Committee on Un-American Activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Topic - Very Poorly Written","review":"The book covers an amazing subject matter and I was excited to get it and dive into but. But after slogging through the first 100 pages, I had to see what other reviewers may have said on Amazon. I see that a few agree with me. The topic is one of the most amazing of our time, but the writing is horribly academic, boring, and poor. Gregg Herken's writing style (if one can even call it that) is similar to a law review article, where facts are piled up high, references are many, but any style and creativity is buried. In this book, it's does not exist. I would not recommend this to other to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passe","review":"Have you ever come across a movie that you loved in your youth and watched it again, only to find out that what you had enjoyed so much had become trite? This is what I thought of this book, so much so that I put it down (which I have done less than 10 times in my life. The narrative is stilted and maybe it is an American vs Brit thing but I also felt it was amateurish.Don't get me wrong, I have read may Archer novels and loved \\"As the Crow Flies\\" which I read several times and recommended to family.

It is a typical Archer book in the manner that it weaves the story togeather through character development. The characters are all very interesting and it is quite a good tale that Archer tells. The best part for me is that the ending was a little bit different from what I was expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Long","review":"This was the first book I've read by Jeffrey Archer and I don't know if I will read another - I at least won't PAY to read another in any case. While the story was interesting enough for me to want to finish it to see exactly how it ended, I was often frustrated while reading it and came away feeling that it was unnecessarily long. There were several sections that felt to me that they did not contribute much to the story or were lengthened considerably for no real reason at all except if the author were being paid by the page. I also felt Archer tried to make the story super-complicated, almost as if taunting the reader to try to keep up with him. The only real praise I can give this work is that he enticed me to want to finish it, rather than reaching the 50 page threshold and deciding to not waste my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and confusing","review":"I found this to be slow moving, confusing and boring.

I has almost everything that makes a thriller a book not to put down -- from a rich plot full of intrigues, timely revelations and breath-taking suspense; to characters that are colorful, rugged, vicious, smart and daring; to a setting that is far-reaching, complex and fascinating.

In this one, a \\"coma plague\\" has begun disrupting the world, including the young daughter of one of Constantine's best mates in London. The highly original cause is a series of \\"start-up\\" hells on Earth by lesser demons tired of their place in the satanic hierarchy. In their quest to halt the plague and retrieve the girl's soul, Constantine and his buddy end up in Los Angeles (where else?) and conflict ensues. This is a very noir graphic novel, better than most, but it's a little heavy on the British street slang. The art, though, is first-rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"at-te tank gunner rocks!!!","review":"THIS FIGURE IS SO COOL BUT IS VERY HARD TO GET. I LIKE THIS FIGURE SO MUCH.

Marsha has the ability to tell a story like few others can. This book took you to the battle fields in vivid color and description. The emotion of the characters and their love and devotion are powerful. The intense emotion of the battle of Culloden is so amazingly real that you almost feel you are right there. You can picture the mists of Scotland, feel the sting of winter, and know the pain and grief of loss in battle. And the little surprise at the end of the story will catch you off guard. Very highly recommended. This is a real story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Pride of Lions first","review":"I read Blood of Roses not knowing it was the sequel to Pride of Lions. I think I would have understood the storyline better if I had known about and read Pride first. This is the continuation of that story as it is about the same two characters.

Leading up to the battle of Culloden the story is passion filled and adventurous but I found myself slowing down and not wanting to continue once the Jacobite group enter's Moy Hall. I knew what was coming and I had my own reservations about experiencing the sorrow and blood shed. I did not know what would happen to all of the character's that I had fallen in love with and frankly did not want to face their demise. Knowing some of the History before hand I had some idea's about the major players on the Scottish side, it was the main character's of the story I was unsure of and after reading many of the reviews I knew I was going to have to face the loss.

I love the lush string arrangements on a lot of the songs, and Jerry is a more than adequate singer. I love the Spanish male singers such as Cristian Castro, and Alejandro Fernandez, and Jerry Rivera is a great discovery for me. I love Latin ballads, and this CD is perfect for that. I'll have to turn my mother on to this CD. She'll love it as much as I do. She's of Panamanian descent, and we totally love Spanish music.

Rebus has many bad feelings, and when her body turns ups, Rebus and his faithful Sergeant Holmes trail a killer. The investigation throws them up against some of the so-called \\"cream\\" of society, and John has to pussyfoot around in order not to upset feelings. These Rebus books are really good.

If all his books meander and rest on scatology, that's it. One more try - because I bought it already.

Although I find the TV version of Rebus (BBC) interesting and stylish, the episodes are very moody, dark and gristly.

The reader took a little getting used to, but I got into it and enjoyed it.I am giving it 4 stars instead of five because I thought the ending was good, but not great.Another reviewer refers to the \\"new, mellower\\" Rebus, so maybe the earlier works are violent.

Plenty of ham to go with it, too. Bleah. The only reason there's more than one star in my rating is that the film does very well in making its point against racism, a socially redeeming factor that was very much germaine in the late '50s.

Rosanno Brazzi is pretty right-on casting - sensual and sexy; one can understand why a younger woman would fall for him; I echo the sentiments about John Kerr - not exactly the type one envisions as the great lover. Ray Walston is an embarassment as the \\"comic\\" lead. The use of the color filters is distracting beyond tolerance. Apparently, Logan wanted to elminate them, but there wasn't time or money.I look forward to seeing this classic on stage to do justice to how wonderful it can be with the right elements."},{"rating":"1","title":"This musical did not age well. I'm very disappointed.","review":"This musical did not age well at all. I'm crushed and disappointed. Purchased for my granddaughter based on my memory of the film, but the acting was weak and stilted, with the exception of the old Polynesian dame, who was WONDERFUL. Still, not worth the money or experience of seeing it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Pacific","review":"I first sore this film many years ago on the Cinerama extra wide screen with multi track speakers. The film was spectacular.Acknowledging the limitations of a DVD, and the age of the film, visually this DVD was excellent. But why have they not included stereo sound? The music is so important, yet they have chosen to distribute this musical in mono, which to me is flat and lifeless. If you want a decent sound rendition, I suggest the CD version of the original sound track, which is infinitely better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loss of 21 minutes from original = loss of coherence","review":"I think South Pacific is second only to Sound of Music among movie musicals. The music and visuals are superb. The only real weakness is in the casting of John Kerr as the lieutenant. Unfortunately, videos of South Pacific, including this DVD, have been trimmed to 150 minutes from the original 171 minutes. There is some loss of coherence as a result. Why do they do this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatiful Musical with Options for Audience Participation","review":"The South Pacific DVD was well worth what I paid for it. It included footage from the original Broadway show with Mary Martin and Ezio Pinza. In addition there was a 60 Minutes interview with James Michener detailing the history and background of his work, Tales from the South Pacific. This DVD also includes footage on the making of the film and the controversial issues South Pacific deals with - for the first time on Broadway and film - interracial relationships. While provocative at the time, the film makers did not back off from addressing this important issue. The inclusion of an option for singalong was great. It made the South Pacific party more than just watching the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Pacific","review":"This is a great version of the movie includes the original theater version of the film which most people did not even know existed.. However I still preferred the version that most people saw at the movies..by the way BOTH versions are included in this purchase ...this is still one of the best musicals ever made.."},{"rating":"2","title":"vintage movie watcher","review":"\\"South Pacific\\" is a beautifully filmed, acted, scripted movie, that will take your breath away! The acters and actresses are superb! The movie is a must see for all ages, especially, vintage movie fans! I loved this movie, I cried in certain scenes, and I am a man! The movie has blend of romance, action, mystery, comedy, and drama. It's a movie you will not forget; and a great musical. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"Yes South Pacific is a good movie I enjoy this movie each time i see it, movie name is South Pacific"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Musical Classic","review":"I love Rogers and Hammerstein's music and this has some of their best!

This is a splendid Blu-ray disc and provides much better picture quality than the DVD. The colours are good, the images are startlingly clear and there is considerable depth of focus. I am particularly pleased to report that although there is minimal grain in the images, they do not seem to have been subjected to digital noise reduction (DNR) to make them more acceptable to young viewers who don't know what film looks like. (Other 20th Century Fox Blu-ray discs such as Patton and The Longest Day have been severely damaged by clumsy and excessive use of DNR.)I strongly recommend this Blu-ray disc to all fans of South Pacific and to all Home Theatre fans who love watching High Definition discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorites!","review":"This movie is tops in all categories, Acting, Music, Story and especially Cinematography, the color temperature changing for each song was a very effective, subtle artistic touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!!","review":"This recording is brilliant and shuch a joy to have. I recommend it for anyone that loves musicals. It is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"South Pacific is a classic. The beauty, the actors, and the music all come together to make this a movie my family and I truly enjoy. There is much to learn from the movie too, as it's much deeper than just scenery and music. It addresses prejudice in a very tactful way, as it was meant to do by it's writers. At the time it was written, few screen writers would dare attempt such, as they were sure to be snubbed, but thankfully South Pacific became a huge success, despite early poor reviews, and has turned into a genuine classic. I highly recommend the movie, especially for the price on Amazon.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roadshow looks more like road kill","review":"Yes, leave it to Fox to first screw up the Todd-AO version of Oklahoma! on DVD, and now the roadshow version of South Pacific (disc 2). As other reviewers have commented, Fox spliced the additional roadshow segments into the movie with virtually no restoration. So you go from film frames with brilliant technicolor to others with washed out color, and even film that is at times out of sync. The effect? Simply horrible!!! Yet another brilliant move by Fox.....NOT!!!! Just what I expected from a studio that is only interested in making money rather than preserving a musical national treasure. I just shudder to think what they did to Carousel. Stay tuned, I've yet to review it."},{"rating":"2","title":"music lover","review":"I was delighted with the promptness which brought this wonderful film to me. I had seen a play about South Pacific and it really prompted me to send for the DVD. I enjoyed it as much seeing it this time as I did over 40years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK movie marred by inferior video quality","review":"Joshua Logan's \\"South Pacific\\" is moderately entertaining and a reasonably accurate rendition of the stage version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's hit musical. The movie is hardly energetic, but does try to remain faithful to the original, including some awful dialogue, but also including the courageous theme of interracial love and marriage. Mitzi Gaynor and Rossano Brazzi are adequate but lackluster in the principal parts. The use of color filters to underscore the musical numbers gradually becomes annoying, and doesn't add anything to the presentation. This is still a great movie to have, especially if you're a musical buff. The biggest disappointment (for the DVD version) was the second-rate video quality that seems to be present on all of Fox's classic R&H musicals, like \\"The King & I\\" and \\"Oklahoma\\". It's just too soft and poorly focussed. (They're probably using an inferior source for the digital transfer.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"South Pacific Collector's edition","review":"I had great difficulty in getting this disc to play. It would not play properly on either our dvd player or the dvd drive on the computer. The segments that I did see were technically poor with weird colour as described by the other negative reviews on amazon.Ultimately I did find a computer with a drive that could read the whole disc but by them I had lost interest. Visually poor, and technically a massive problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like the songs.","review":"This may be a classic musical but I don't like watching it and I like the songs even less. I do like Sound of Music but the visuals, the actors and the music of South Pacific turn me off. They should remake this storyline about the US Navy in the South Pacific during WW2 because it IS a good idea. But I have never liked hearing the songs. This movie just makes me want to see Operation Petticoat and Mr. Roberts (which always makes me cry.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch","review":"We purchased this movie because our teenage son was singing a song from the movie for a competition. We found it too painful to watch the whole movie. It's cheesy and terribly dated. We love musicals and have a list of many that we are happy to watch over and over again, but this one will not be added to that list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It helped a significant amount","review":"I went to school in Rome for a semester, and during a four day weekend I decided to go to Sardinia b/c I saw some pics of it on the 'net and it looked and sounded awesome. As I read this book I became very excited at all the cool things one could do and see.The book listed many of the best beaches, festivals, scenery, and archaeological sites of the island. It was very hard to decide what I should do first!The book was a huge help and gave me lots of great ideas. However, I did have some trouble finding some of the things mentioned in the book, despite what seemed like very detailed directions. That may have had more to do with the very old and poorly maintained roads and signs than the book though. I have found some pictures online of places that I don't think were mentioned in the book that I want to see the next time I go, so I wouldn't rely exclusively on one source when planning your trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique perspective, valuable insights, and a fun read","review":"It's not often that you find these three elements -- uniqueness, insights, and fun -- in the same book, but in Raising the Peaceable Kingdom, you do.Animals can teach us many things we really need to learn, and humans are just beginning to wake up to the idea, helped along by books like this one. Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson is a gifted and inspired writer, and I heartily recommend this book (and all of his books, frankly) to anyone -- from those who have pets/love animals and are already predisposed to enjoy the topic to those who might be a bit skeptical about what humans might learn from animals about getting along with each other. If you're not sure which side of that fence you're on, it doesn't really matter, because you'll enjoy the book either way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too preachy for me","review":"I found the book to be a little too preachy about vegetarianism; I think the author is quite proud of being a vegetarian, and he hits on that point quite a bit.I really didn't feel that inspired about what animals can teach us about tolerance or friendship, either.I grew up on a farm, and have seen firsthand how \\"tolerant\\" and \\"friendly\\" animals can be towards each other. I guess that I am just a little too realistic to believe in a beautiful co-existence with nature; I feel that nature is nature, and will do its best to exist, no matter whose expense is taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Exactly Dorothy Parker!","review":"This book contains some interesting feng shui advice that you won't find anywhere else.

Its author comes from Black Hat Sect, a New Age Feng Shui School born in 70's last Century. It is not Traditional Chinese Feng Shui at all.The book is full of wierd advises, written in such manner that may lead readers to believe Feng Shui is some kind of Spiritual Decoration, mixed with chinese superstition and New Age beliefs.Don\`t waste your money on this book.There are a lot of serious books on Feng Shui.

Don't trust the library to have it when you need it on a gotta-clean-this-messy-apartment kind of day; get your own copy.

I have to think those red ribbons aound my plumbing had something to do with it! (And the fact that I have a purple \\"Prosperity\\" bathroom)!Loved this book.

It is written clearly, provides concrete examples, and the reasoning behind doing certain things is explained properly. In other books I have on the subject, a lot of time is spent dealing with the more arcane aspects of Feng Shui, which many of us do not need or want.This book is practical and easy to use, and its format allows one to walk around the house carrying it and applying its suggestions without having to take volumnous notes and study for days. If you want to bring order to your life, stimulate the flow of \\"chi\\" (energy) through your home, and make it a happier, brighter place (and your life better at the same time), this is the book to help you.

The tone of the book is childish with corny jokes thrown in frequently. Feng Shui is about the ancient art of placement to become more in tune with the universe. The author of this book treats Feng Shui almost as a magic act to get what you want. In addition to being written in a disrespectful manner, many important aspects of Feng Shui were omitted from the text. Many other reviews of this book are from people stating this is the first book on Feng Shui they understand. Perhaps this is because so many aspects of Feng Shui were not even mentioned in this book. My advice is - try another book on Feng Shui. It may be a little harder to understand, just study harder or hire a Feng Shui consultant to help you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent content hidden by simplistic and giddy writing","review":"If you are simply looking for a book that can tell you the practical ways you can bring feng shui into your life, and you don't care about the tone in which the book is written, then you may like this book. I, however, was very put off by the silly, almost giddy way the author writes. The minute I read that the Love/Relationship corner of a house is the area you want to work on if you're looking for a \\"shagadelic good time,\\" I was done.

This book is well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Ineffective","review":"This book seems simple but doesn't really work. I tried many, many of the recommendations. Not only did my life not change,but my apartment looked terrible. The book is overly simplistic and mentions little about intention, putting energy into your actions, house blessings, etc. I just recently discovered Feng Shui for Dummies and would recommend it instead. I just made a few of the changes from it and the energy in my place just feels much better. Even if I don't get major life changes, my interior design is flowing better.

Every song sounds the same and Anders' song craft feels underdeveloped and amateurish. I am always on the look out for new female voices, and was excited to hear PJ Harvey had produced this album.

Allison uses elements of her own harrowing experiences as she was growing up in certain themes in the movie and uses a wide variety of music in the movie's soundtrack including a couple of her daughter's songs \\"Flooded Starry Night\\" and \\"Here I Forget\\". This was the scope that I first experienced Tiffany's music and thought it was a perfect accompaniment as the protagonist deals with a tragic experience in her past. I don't think the movie is available on amazon, but it featured some great music by Beachwood Sparks, Nick Drake, LeftBanke, Tiffany Anders, and many others. If you happen to catch the movie, be warned that some of the scenes are very intense and show humanity at its worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like most big lift the flap books, fun and educational","review":"It seems like most all of this kind of big lift the flap books are a little similar---a page about letters, one about numbers, an opposite page and so forth, but they are also all pretty well done and big child pleasers! My 2 sons really like this one. Their favorite part is the \\"book within a book\\" of The Three Little Pigs. It got my older son interested in that fairy tale, which we then read in different versions, and then in fairy tales in general! One thing to note---the characters of Arthur and Francine and all of the gang seem younger in this book than in the show, more like preschool versions of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"This author managed to get a grade-school type exercise in creative writing published.

They used that junky digital camera stuff to make it. I rented it because it had a cool cover but when I saw the first few seconds and saw how cheap it was I almost shut it off.

Late one night, his mother's boyfriend murders the teen in a field near a scarecrow.

The actor who plays the main character looks like he is 40 and the other teens look like they are closer to 30! All I could do was just laugh at the stupidity of the casting. I prefer to watch the sequelScarecrow Slayerover this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"another scarecrow flick","review":"don't think i've ever been real impressed by any of the scarecrow films even though there's only like 4 or 5 of em. they must be hard to make. this movie tried wayy to hard, the scarecrow tried to have a personality like freddie krueger but was more ridiculous than anything. was fairly entertaining and had a few cool death scenes but other than that i can't say i highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could have been","review":"I hoped for an atmospheric, suspenseful and classy horror movie, but unfortunately none of those qualities are found here. All the characters are caricatures, the tongue in cheek humor falls flat, and the overdone, often grotesque acting grates. The gore is fine, but the stalking scenes have no buildup and no tension, so it's hard to care. This could have been so much more - the elements for a good horror show are here, including nice photography and special effects, but there is no solid foundation to lay them on. Those who crave gore for its own sake probably won't be disappointed, but more discerning horror fans will only be frustrated by all the missed possibilities in Scarecrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good horror flick!","review":"This movie has some surprising, well, surprises.

The scarecrow was pretty creepy looking. Ok, we're done with the good, now the bad. Do we start with a script so bad that even an infinite number of monkeys with an infinite number of typewriters would never write it or do we begin with acting as hambone and scenery chewing as a high school play. Perhaps we should go right to the incompetent directing. Emmanuel Itier has a credit at the end of the movie with a laundry list of directors and writers he says have inspired him including John Carpenter, Stephen King, Wes Craven, and Dario Argento.

Yes, it does have lots of reward ideas (I tried counting them but only got to around half of the advertised 1001 ideas). What really disappointed me, however, was that most of them required a fairly large expenditure. I work for a small company (under 100 employees) and in a tight economic environment, we just don't have the funds to be sending people to Hawaii or some of the other *big* rewards in this book. I needed something that recommended inexpensive reward options. This book was not it. (I did find another one listed on Amazon that advertises it has \\"101 ways to reward team members for $20 or less\\" -- I think that might suit me better. I'm going to buy that one next and see if it suits my situation any better.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Lots of ho-hum ideas about motivating employees.

It is full of neat and creative ideas to show your employees that you truly care about them. Although it is supposed to be easy to reward people, we often forget about doing so and on occasion run out of ideas to accomplish this goal. I hihgly recommend it...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the bunch -- easy to read, a must-have","review":"I've had this book for almost 10 years, and as an HR professional, it's a requirement in my library. I also have 1001 Ways to Energize... Must-haves. They both get borrowed frequently so I have to really wallpaper my name all over the books in order to get them back.

The book's message? When one is too greedy a bastard to pay employees a fair wage, simply devise schemes that make them temporarily forget that they are being exploited. Such short-term distractions allow the \\"chosen ones\\" to continue creaming off profits for themselves.It doesn't take much time to figure out that there is a chasm between executive rewards (e.g., multi-million dollar payouts, regardless of performance) and the scattered bones thrown to an organization's \\"little people\\".[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a book for morons","review":"very sad book attempting to manipulate employees with the most pathetic ploys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody screwed up.","review":"Forgive the rating, but this problem needs to be fixed - we actually like the music.I was looking at the preview of the songs for the Lunar Strain album by In Flames, and thought I was listening to song #4 Dreamscape, and then noticed that both iTunes and Youtube identified that song as #3, Starforsaken.Being a complete nerd, I looked at your source code, and noticed that the songs seem to be placed in an array, and that that array started at an index of 1, rather than zero. This means that when you want to play song #3, you actually get song #4, as any good programmer knows.You might want to look into fixing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"Henry Butler is a genius!

When we purchased a new kitchen faucet 6 years ago, it came with this free robe hook, which we installed on the cabinet next to the kitchen sink, on which to hang our kitchen towels. I actually sewed loops (of bias tape) in the center of each of my towels, so they would not slide off the hook. When I decided we could use a towel (robe) hook on the cabinet on the other side of the sink, I search Amazon. I didn't really want to pay $23.63 for it, but heck the first one was free, and I had enough items to get FREE SHIPPING!The bronze towel hooks do their job and are a nice compliment to the bronze kitchen faucet. I highly recommend this for hanging a towel or robe with a loop on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no diamond in the rough...","review":"I'm not sure why I decided to buy this flick - probably the low price and the positive reviews.It turned out to be a mistake.This movie is awful.
