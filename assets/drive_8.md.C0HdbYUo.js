It's every bit as sturdy as the high quality fitness machines you would find at a gym. And it's compact and doesn't take up any room.My only problem (but I think this could be even more of a problem with other units), is that the feel is just not like pavement.

The performance by Gregory Peck was great (almost in George C. Scott league but not quite). The performance by the supporting actors was not bad, especially the guys that played Truman and Roosevelt.I think where the movie fell short was that it seemed too jumpy. The scenes of his battles (both military and political) seemed short. There didn't seem to be closure on the battles other than jumping to the next battle to be fought. I've never seen the uncut version, so I don't know if that's addressed there. It seems like this movie would have been better served with another hour at least.I would have to say my favorite aspect of the movie was his warning as he was fired. Namely that you should never tell the military to fight a war of half measures. Also, that Congress shouldn't shirk its responsibility by not declaring war."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am proud to be the best general and I am right","review":"This movie about the military carreer of General Douglas MacArthur from 1941 to 1953 is a very good one.

So many movies that were made before all the technological advances are disappointing when viewed today.

I feel that the storyline is closer to fact than some parts of \\"Patton\\" were, as they, including Francis Ford Coppola, were a bit inventive in that movie, to say the least. MacArthur brings out the complexity and hypocrisy in this flawed, but very talented commander, who ultimately was a much more important person in the US Army before, during and after WWII.

It has no guidelines for training that are specific to the breed, no cautions for health concerns that are prevalent in rat terriers and has only a brief history with no sourcing. Additionally, many sections read like product advertisements, touting the wonders of Nylabone.This is a fine book for general information and for \\"awww, how cute,\\" but turned out to be not at all what I needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Generic","review":"As many have said, this book is just too generic. Beyond that, I must take issue with the comments by \\"A reader from colorado\\" above. Millions of dogs die in shelters each year because breeders massively overproduce puppies to conform to some artificial human standard of beauty. Who the #)(@*$*( cares?! It's personality that counts. If you want a Rat Terrier or any dog-- do not go to a breeder but visit your local shelter or an on-line resource such as Petfinder.org. Breeding dogs should be criminal until every single unwanted canine has been placed in a permanent loving home. I have a rescue RT, and she is a fantastic girl. She had in fact been dumped by a breeder at animal control after she stopped \\"producing\\". Disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I purchased this kettle because the color and design looked great. The first reviewer said it all - irritating and dangerous! It chipped almost immediately, with careful use. It's impossible to pour water, even if you let it sit for a few minutes after boiling (which I do with all kettles), without dripping, spilling and spurting boiling water all over the place! This kettle could not be cuter and I loved the idea of not having to touch the lid, but it was just a waste of money. I couldn't use it, let alone allow my kids to boil water with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous as well as irritating","review":"Real rating (-5), do not buy this kettle. I bought this kettle for my elderly parents based on the automatic spout opening mechanism and its compact design. Very DANGEROUS for anyone, more so for the elderly or younger operators, pouring boiling water.

What Nicky does for Selma really shows that he has grown up since the start of Unseen in The burning. Overall the book was really good. Faith had some really funny lines.

She bought me them as soon as each one came out, funny thing is my best friend who doestn live at all close to me, got me the first one. But this is on the third one, it was a very well written book. The scenes between Buffy and Angel were pricless and touch the b/a shippers heart. A problem was of how much Buffy acted as if she loved Riley more than anything of the world, and Angel was past, why he dreamed about her and their forgotten day. Otherwise it is a good read, as a fan of either show, or the B/A or even b/r(gag) relationship.

Their customer service department employees are always very rude and snotty and they act like they are doing you a favor to even talk to you about their products.

My final authority was Consumer Report, who ranked this set very highly in terms of quality--and it was cheaper than some of the more prestigious competition.I have been using the cookware for a month and so far, I have not been disappointed! The non-stick works beautifully, although I have been trying to clean up quickly after use (this may not last long). I have even sauted vegetables with no oil sucessfully. The handles stay extremely cool and the glass top lids make staying in control easy.Not necessairly negative but prospective buyers should be aware that they are noticably heavier than cheaper cookware.From my view, the only negative (minor) is that the two sauce pans are a little slimmer/taller than I would like, although total capacity is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain","review":"10 of the most used items in basic household cooking.

The 2 and 3 qt sauciers are exactly what I need for pasta, potatoes, veggies. They have a nice heft to them, and the non-stick coating has worked flawlssly.

I struggled to absorb the information in the book because there was so much of it, and after I took the test I found out that most of it was extraneous. I got a 630 on the test, and while that isn't a terrible score, I bought the book in hopes of working up to somewhere near a 700.

For some reason, these calculators are plagued with horrible documentation, no matter who writes it. Apparently, the assumption is that if you're smart enough to use them, you should be smart enough to figure them out. This is true - but it's time consuming and not worth it unless you REALLY need the functionality they provide. If you must use one of the advanced HP calculators, this pamplet may be of some help if it doesn't give you a headache - otherwise buy an HP 40GS, which is the best grapher on the market by a long shot and costs half the price of a 50G. 40GS comes with a great manual and is very intuitive to use and program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorer!Poorer!Poorer!","review":"Some of your reviewers must have been watching a different movie to me.

The long version (rarely seen on TV) of Midway with more detail (among the missing scenes: the death of VT-3, the massacre of VMF-221 and the battle of Coral Sea) is (I think anyway) actually a better movie than the theatre original which is on this DVD.Upon further reflection I should add the following. As it was pointed out, many of the additional scenes were shot for TV and not part of the original movie. However, if they could jam in those love (useless) scenes, why couldn't they stick in the combat (good) scenes that everyone else (myself included) wanted?"},{"rating":"1","title":"When will a more historically accurate \\"Midway\\" be released?","review":"Don't get me wrong--this movie is, overall, a good movie. However, the Coral Sea footage should've been included in this so-called \\"Collecto'r Edition. Also, the contribution of the Army Air Corps should've been included (for example, 4 Martin B-26 Marauders went in and attacked the Japanese carrier force. Each B-26 carried an aerial torpedo slung under its belly. Only one B-26 made it back to Midway, and just barely. For further information on this, read \\"The Ragged, Rugged Warriors\\" by Martin Caidin. The info on the B-26 attack is at the end of the book).Also, anyone who has seen \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" will recognize the scenes which were taken from it and used in \\"Midway\\". Why can't Universal release this movie with the Coral Sea footage in it? For that matter, couldn't some more extra footage showing the B-26 attack be specially filmed?My husband told me about all this when we watched it recently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass for now.","review":"Another great film, ruined with two channel audio tracks. Wait to buy this one in surround sound.

Midway tells the story of, you guessed it, the battle of Midway. This movie is more along the lines of an entertaining documentary than really a movie, yet it still great. I dont know, maybe because this is the most interesting battle of the entire war in my opinion, but this is truly one of those movies you have to see if you enjoy war movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke!!!","review":"Bad movie except for a few performances (notably Hal Holbrook). The movie stole a lot of footage from 'Tora Tora Tora' excetra, and added a few extras such as Heston's 'Matt Garth\\" character (never existed) as well as Edward Albert's role of his son who is in love with a Japanese American girl. Oh please!!!! If you must watch this movie, make sure it contains the Coral Sea battle (which is good) and Heston's relationship with his girlfriend which will shed some light on his character for later in the movie.

Using real footage from the attack when possible, and some real footage that doesn't match in others and really bugs me, this movie is great overall and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heston at his best","review":"I first saw this movie when it was first released while vacationing in Hawaii with my parents. I thought it was hammy then, and still do, but it's fun to watch. Heston was a big actor and eats up every scene he's in; it's like a WWII version of \\"Earthquake\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Details Innaccurate","review":"I agree with all of the others. The Battle of Coral Sea should have been included. There were some errors in actual facts about the battle. In the video, the four Japanese carriers were heavily damaged, while in the actual battle, they, I believe, were sunk. Another, nit picking detail, is in the flick, the Japanese carrier 'Akagi' the island superstructure was like all other aircraft carriers; it was on the starboard side of the ship. In actuality, the Akagi was the one carrier whose superstructure was on the port side.The one criticism about footage from 'Tora Tora Tora' doesn't fly with me. Using that footage and some of the same Japanese actors actually ties the two flicks together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock Footage!?","review":"This movie is bad because of two reasons: the use of stock footage of the battle of Midway instead of recreating the events and all the actors are speaking English instead of their native languages. The reason that \\"The Longest Day,\\" \\"Patton,\\" \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\" and \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" are better is because they only use stock footage when showing a WWII newsreel. All the battles are recreated. The latter reason is also a similar connection to the forementioned movies. Anybody who has seen the Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune in his Kurosawa masterpieces knows his gruf, hard voice. He doesn't sound like that at all when he speaks English, he instead sounds like a Japanese man trying to speak English. These two problems ruin all the credibility of the movie. The extra star is to showing the movie in its orignial Panavision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate","review":"I was disappointed by the inaccuracies and vulgarity of the language portrayed (although that part may have actually been accurate to the day). Additionally, the acting/directing done in this movie was not up to par with the caliber of the actors present, in my opinion.

There really was no imagination used in its making. Many of the fight scenes were from Tora!Tora!Tora! The war footage had too many scenes from the late war period.

The wrong planes, the wrong ships...The only saving grace is Heston, he could add a touch of class to a Hillary Clinton/Rosie O'Donell lesbian scene....Oh well, I'll stick with \\"a wing and a prayer\\", real airplanes, real carriers, and closer to the truth....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midway","review":"The best Navy war movie ever made.

They tried to use a lot of actual battle footage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairly Good History Lesson","review":"MIDWAY moves a little faster than TORA,TORA,TORA and is only slightly shorter. It will be entertaining for those who are interested in World War II and the crucial Battle of Midway which is really more of an air battle than a good old-fashioned naval battle. The strong cast is led by Henry Fonda and Charlton Heston and includes James Coburn, Glenn Ford, Hal Holbrook, Robert Mitchum, Toshire Mifune and James Shigeta.MIDWAY failed to receive any Oscar nominations in 1978 when the Academy Award competition was dominated by ROCKY and NETWORK"},{"rating":"1","title":"LESS THAN MEDIOCRE","review":"I was in the US Navy, and I found this movie absurdly unrealistic. First of all, no one as old as Charlton Heston was ever involved in actual battles in WW2. His acting, as usual, was lousy, his age betrayed the film. I find elder actors degrading the heroes of WW2 repugnant. I gave this video away to the local Goodwill store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Mid-70's Universal Quasi-Epic","review":"This is a standard-issue 1970's Universal movie (think \\"Airport '75,\\" \\"Earthquake,\\" etc.) It has a cliche-ridden script, cardboard characterizations, blink-and-you'll-miss-them cameos by older stars and it seems to have raided the stock footage of every studio in town. The great Toshiro Mifune is rather obviously dubbed by voice actor Paul Frees. All that said, they did get most of the facts right, and if you can get past the cheese factor, it has an interesting story to tell. I just think that the pivotal naval battle of World War II deserved a more documentary approach, ala \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect followup to Pearl Harbor and Doolittle Raid","review":"Very few movies can capture the historical significance of a wartime battle and dramatize it in an interesting and efficient way. Midway does it all. This would be a perfect movie if not for the contrived love story. It deserved something much more insightful and comprehensive. The battle scenes are top notch, the fair and honorable treatment of the Japanese story, although somewhat stiff and typical, is still refreshing. The vital part that the counter intelligence office played is well represented. This is one movie that I can watch over and over again, as long as my family lets me. This was a most critical and pivotal battle is our nation's fight with Japan and our own struggle with isolationism. The amazing combination of strategy, calculated risk, determination, skill and just dumb luck that allowed the Navy to make this stand is portrayed with honesty. We owe these men our lives. We owe these movie makers our respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midway","review":"I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband (retired Marine).

The facts were still there and the movie was entertaining and informative. A well done presentation with an all star cast that works well together.

The only set back I feel about this movie is that it has used some of the footage from Tora Tora Tora. which I feel has damaged the action part of the film. Midway is a small island. It does not have a big airport like Honolulu. Why do they have to add in the scene of a big airport being bombed and a fighter crashed into other fighters in a big field. Besides, the landing of a B-17 with only one wheel is definitely not necessary. Anyone who like war movies will surely recognised the scene is from Tora Tora Tora."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Flawed Classic & a Sentimental Favorite","review":"I'll start by saying I TOTALLY agree with my fellow reviewers regarding the use of recycled footage from Tora,Tora,Tora! & other WW II movies, footage of aircraft & ships either not present at Midway or not even in service until well after the battle as well as the incomplete feeling you get watching the film without the Coral Sea scenes.I first saw this movie during it's 1976 theatrical release as a 9-year old & as flawed as it is Midway is the movie that inspired my interest in WW II, military & naval avation of 1914-45 & history in general so for that I'm grateful.

Contains alternate version of 1968 theatrical","review":"Bottom line: This is not the advertised movie. This is a new edit of the 1968 theatrical release which has removed a signifigant portion of the film. While the underlying story is the same, and the film is composed entirely of the 1968 version's footage, be warned that you can't judge this one by its cover- it really isn't what it claims to be.I was unsure how to rate this as my main complaint is not the content per se but rather the fact that the content is not what is advertised. They should not sell this as they are without disclosing prominently to every prospective purchaser that this is a shorter re-edited version of the theatrical release. Whatever the merits of the decision to re-edit the film, their is no excuse for releasing it under the same title without fair warning to purchasers."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Coral Sea sequence on new DVD!","review":"I purchased the Collector's Edition with the high hope that the Coral Sea sequence among others would be included.

Heston/ Sullivan romance adds nothing to the movie. Albert's character is winey. If you start watching the movie at the point where the American carriers leave Pearl Harbor is not a bad movie. The scenes of the air attacks on the Japanese carriers is interesting and has a degree of accuracy. Most unforgiveable and annoying thing about the movie is most of the battle on Midway Island is lifted from the attack on pearl Harbor in Tora, Tora, Tora.

I like them to be (realistic) this movie is loaded with flaws (big flaws) .First someone please tell me why the Japanise are speaking english in this movie? It looks so cheap and goofy . Japanise dialoge with subtitles would have been more realistic. Next their is a sub plot with an American Pilot who falls in love with a Japanise woman who is in an American Isolation camp. I am not un romantic person but it had nothing to do with the battle at Midway ( and the acting was bad and melo dramatic in this part). Next this movie uses footage that was recycled from the movie TORA TORA TORA ( A MUCH BETER MOVIE) now thats cheesy!.

It uses outtakes from Tora Tora Tora, so the viewer sees interesting things like battleship masts at Midway. The actors, except maybe Henry Fonda and Hal Holbrook, do lousy jobs. Charlton Heston is particularly irritating- you get the impression that he was running the Pacific fleet and Admiral Nimitz just came in on the weekends to read his mail.The \\"romance\\" angle in the movie just slows it down and somehow makes you wonder if these people's personal problems were bigger than World War II!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but. some parts are laughable.","review":"I'm not sure on the accuracy of the film.

In some instances, someone takes off in an F4F, then is shown flying an F6F- not in service until 1943! Charlton Heston, who appears to be in some sort of pain the whole movie, meets his demise in a crashing Helldiver dive bomber, not in service until 1943-44. It appears that the producers, and director just did not care that they were putting out such an embarassing product. This battle, one of the most important in our history, deserves so much better than this slapdash turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stinks","review":"This movie is so poorly done and the footage from old movies like Tora!

Where as Bob Marley was a poet and a prophet, Peter Tosh was the truth-teller and the sooth-seer (sp?).

The exception is the chase, of course, long celebrated as perhaps the best ever captured on film. In addition to the action elements, however, there are other reasons to add this to your collection, including Gene Hackman's fine, Oscar-winning turn as Popeye Doyle and William Friedkin's energetic direction. French Connection II suffers somewhat by comparison - Hackman is still great, but the movie seems to lack cohesion, as if the writers patched the story together scene by scene, rather than knowing their destination. It is not a bad movie by any means, but certainly not the classic its predecessor is. The bonus materials are nicely presented and pretty interesting, for the most part - a solid, if not particularly spectacular, package."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Crime","review":"This box set includes The French Connection I & II. The original is of course the most well known of the two. The movie is based off the true events of the biggest heroin bust in history.The story follows two of NYPD's narcotics detectives as they stumble onto a hunch which turns into a huge multi-jurisdictional case. Detective Doyle who is played by Gene Hackman, was one of the NYPD's most decorated officers when he retired. The two detectives build their case and eventually narrow their search of suspects before finally getting the approval of the upper brass to make an arrest. This is a great crime drama which follows the original novel and the true story really well.Part II of the set picks up where part I ends.

I have never seen a more dramatic action movie in my life. Gene plays Popeye Doyle a very highly motivated & tough New York cop who tries to crack a foreign drug ring. Doyle's tough, rule breaking & take no prisoners policeman who blurs the line between cop and criminal. The fact that this mean, brutal cop is somehow sympathetic is a testament to Hackman's great skills as an actor.One of my favorite scene is the film's famous car chase. As a drug smuggler races by above on an elevated train, Hackman speeds along in a car on the street below.Director William Friedkin's \\"The French Connection\\" is an exciting, jam packed cop action fest.

A young woman is raped a few times by a group of men who later get their just desserts.Everything in this film is really bad.The acting.The castration scene is one example of bad acting.My question is why did this girl just leave when they were harrasing her?This is not a horror movie.This is not a movie at all.I know a great horror film when I see one.I Spit on Your Grave may have been the kind of film I would have rush to rented on video fifteen years ago.Guess I smartened up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women beware!!!!","review":"Oh boy.... where do I start?

The plot: Woman goes on vacation. Gets repeatedly raped by mountain men for about 40 minutes. Then gets revenge in the last 40 minutes. I can't emphasize enough how utterly terrible this movie is.

There's nothing to like. Don't get me wrong - I hate violence in all its manifestations in life although I like it on screen, but here we can't even empathize this woman 'cos the movie is just sooo bad. The acting is terrible, characters do very strange and unexplainable things. You can't feel with a character when you see everything in the film is false and naive. Don't believe the taglines - there's nothing shocking in there. It's just one big waste of time. You'll feel cheated and robbed. If you hate violence in cinema, I guess you are not reading this right now and if you like shocking movies, don't bother with this one, there are plenty of others that are much more shocking and I assume you already know them all by names.

What is most offensive about this piece of trash if not the rape footage, but rather its ability to manipulate us into thinking this is important in any way. It is badly done, strictly manipulative and in no way worthy of discussion (see, I am being ironic). If you want to witness the true horror of rape, see Kubrick's 'Clockwork' or 'Better Days'. C'mon--kitsch is kitsch and trash is trash and this definitely falls in the latter category. This is offensive not because of its IQ-reducing and blatantly ludicrous aesthetic, but because it is still in the repetoire of horror films(??!!) And the little critique from Cannes speaks volumes to the paucity of good films and postmodern French sensibilities in reviewing films. Let this piece of crap die on the slaughterbench of history--please!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a sick disappointment","review":"I watched this film hoping for a great revenge flick, in which the victim of a brutal rape enacts the revenge on her assailents like they deserve. Unfortunately what I saw was a film about a woman who gets raped, the details being the main focus of the movie, and a bit thrown in at the end about her getting revenge by killing the guys. Only the bath tub guy gets what he deserves. The other guys all get relatively quick and painless deaths. They should be killed like the victims in \\"Saw\\", but they actually seem to get off pretty easily.The fact that the rape scene is around forty minutes long proves the misguidedness of the film makers. It's like using the movie \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" to say that murder is wrong. It just doesn't work to throw the subject in our face and force us to stare at it.I just feel like this movie screams to be remade, with the rape being downplayed, and the revenge being emphasized. It could have been done far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dull, unbelievable movie, with horrible audio","review":"I had been wanting to see this \\"notorious\\" movie for a long time. Now that I have seen it, I can honestly say \\"What's The Big Deal?\\". Other than the fact that the Camile Keaton gets attacked 3 times, and makes a lot of noise while doing so, I didn't see what's was so horrorible about this movie. The one thing that I found bothersome was the sound. Other than the commentary tracks, there is the original mono audio track, and the new dolby 5.1 surround track. I listened to the latter. It sounded like someone had put the microphone up against another tv to record the sound....This movie is unbelievable because Camille Keaton is raped & sodomized by several men on 3 different occasions, and within a day or so she able to walk around like nothing happened to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shant Be Watching This One Again","review":"Interesting footnote: My good friend Terry was the neighbor of a starving young actress a couple of decades ago who was hired to be the model whose backside you see as she's holding a knife on the poster for this film.

The deaths are all done within about 15 minutes, which leaves just over an hour to get bored and lose interest.This movie may have been more entertaining if the story was more padded out and had more of a back story. We don't know anything about the people in it, they are just thrown into a situation and there you have it...a pointless story. For example in a horror you often get told why the killer is murdering teens - he doesn't just turn up and kill people for no reason.I guess if your into classic banned nastys - you may like it because its so outrageous but I just couldn't get anything from it...it was pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst movie off all time.","review":"This is the absolute worst movie I've ever seen there's absoultly no music, or plot for that matter.

A woman writer is in the backwoods for solitude and writing. Her peace is shattered by four overly base and vile males hicks who decide she is a plaything. The graphic rape scenes and sodomy makes you want to kill every male around you. She survives and plots her revenge in four unique ways which are worthy of emulation in our court rooms.

That admonition (some might call it counselling) renders inoperative all suggestions of rape or assault, allowing the perpetrator to skate away free -- and even, in some instances, glean widespread support from society, as happened in one particular Arkansas rape case. In this film, however, the perpetrators did not skate away scott free. Rather, they experienced justice.It was startling to find this film cast in DVD format, as it would normally be considered one of those old cheap throwaways, but obviously the producers thought otherwise. Enjoy -- and always remember the magic everything-is-okay, no-problem-at-all phrase following such an assault: You better get some ice on that."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"I'll give it an extra star for being so extreme and awful.

Well, the man in the tub had brutaly raped this woman and deserved what he got, in my opinion if your a man watching this film what should make you squirm would be the scenes of the rape and just knowing that you are part of the male species that commit this horrific act.

Yes, there is a male rape scene in Deliverance, which again was not at all enjoyable to watch and i shall not be watching again, but the scene in that movie is far shorter and far less graphic than the rape scenes in I Spit On Your Grave.

It made no sense to me. And Steve and others who befriend her why did they not think of it? The Pastor of the Church not think of it? The story seems like a show from the Twilight Zone about 40 years ago before computers could verify the information on the car. I am concerned about the ending sending the wrong message. Relationships need more time and these two people have issues that need to be healed before they can embark on a lifetime commitment. Both have abandonment issues. The Sheriff Roehr is an idiot.

Each one was a five-star read for me,and it's impossible for me to choose a favorite!This book was another page-turner,as were the other two.The main character Alessi More is a very sweet naive young woman with a heartbreaking past. Her sweet nature touches many hearts in the small town of Charity where she becomes stranded.There is a very misguided Pastor in this town and a horrible pact the residents have adhered to.The author does her usual fabulous job of developing the characters so that we readers develop strong feelings of camaraderie with some,and very strong distaste for others.Plus her descriptions of the surroundings,had me imagining the scent of the evergreens,and feeling the cold!Next I will move on to her Historical Romances and see if her originality still shows,LOL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had discovered this author last spring and liked her books -- I had read 5 of them.

I couldn't wait to find out what happened, yet I didn't want it to end. In a nutshell: well-written, good clean romance, very amusing writing at times, and perfect ending.

The diagram they give you to connect does not document the need for the O ring, but nothing comes apart to try to get it on there any other way.The cord to the pump is NOT an outdoors type of cord. When I looked up Garden fountains this came up.

The second episode is \\"The Burden Hardest to Bear,\\" my personal favorite out of all the Transformer episodes.

The hero, Counce, subjects people to horrendous fates, including starvation and torture, all in the name of a greater good--and they love him for it later.

I have stopped using it but may try it again at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"After reading the mixed reviews, I took a chance and bought one. It wasn't a total waste, but basically, it is a hair dryer. When I use it as directed, my hair still requires further streightning with an iron, though only about half as much as it used to. If I had it to do again, I would save the $50, and just buy a better brush to use with my blowdryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot styler","review":"This product is okay, but does not do what I had hoped that it would.

I used it 3 times with GREAT results - and then went to use it the 4th time and again - it would not turn on. Just returned it for a refund. The price would be worth it if it actually worked more than a few times. I think Conair needs to figure out what the problem is and come back with a new improved model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it!","review":"I just purchased this item at Target (paid $49.99) and I love it! I have short, fine hair, growing out into a chin length bob and although it doesn't work the conventional way (brushing out underneath), I can use it similar to a regular hairbrush and it straightens and sleeks my hair.

This was my first straightening styler and I couldn't be happier with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not straighten","review":"When i used this all it did was smooth out my hair and added flips at the ends. It does not make you hair bone straight. As soon as you go outside your hair is puffy again. It does the same thing as my old $20 styler did. I guess using this to dry your hair and then use something else to straighten it would work. But why should i have to buy a second straighter when this thing suppose to do it for you. I also think the model on this box actually has naturally straight hair that is why it is so straight and smooth. Luckily i took it back and got a complete refund.

I was so excited to buy it after seeing the commercial! I thought it was going to the answer to all my hair problems! Well, sorry.... nope. I'm not saying it was awful... but it took me a LOT longer than my usual routine which is quickly blow drying my hair and then going over it with a big-barrel curling iron. So it took longer, and my hair wasn't that smooth. Then I went outside and it immediately got wavy and frizzy.

So, back to the store it goes tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this hotbrush with the hopes that it would shorten the time it takes to dry my hair straight. Well it does do that but you are left with a frizzy mess if your hair is naturally curly.

The top part was pretty straight, but the bottom half of my shoulder length hair was sort of waved. Ugh, just a piece of complete junk! I dried my hair a little better with my blowdryer thinking maybe it was just too wet for the thing to handle, but nope, even on slightly damp hair it sucked.

But this film is just sad. To see these musicians talk about how many people they fought and how much cooler they were than the rest is not punk at all. Punk is freedom and what hardcore became is prison. The conformity they tried to escape is what they became in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Omissions to Count...","review":"The name of the film is American Hardcore, but never once mentioned are seminal Hardcore legends Reagan Youth, Warzone and the Angry Samoans. The Dead Kennedys, Misfits, Husker Du, 7 Seconds and Suicidal Tendencies are briefly mentioned and in no way given their due. Much of the running time of the documentary focuses on the California, Boston and DC scenes. But how can you cover Cali in depth without delving deep into the Dead Kennedys? The film is completely disjointed and has no rhyme or reason as they move from California to Boston back to California to DC and then briefly to New York. I know the intention was good but the product is subpar and heinously omits bands that should have gotten their 15 minutes for their contributions to this important underground scene. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A spotty, disjointed, incomplete mess","review":"Fortunately I rented this from Neflix and did not buy it. I would not recommend that anyone who knows anything about or has any interest in American Hardcore buy this CD. First, it is impossible to document the history of this genre of American music without mentioning and focusing somewhat on the Dead Kennedys. DK was as important, if not more important, than Black Flag. This is a mess and should be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I agree 100% with reviews below that say this movie is basically just a disjointed collection of clips. Not having anything about bands like The Misfits and Dead Kennedys (to name 2) in this movie is a disgrace. And as a Canadian I take offense to the fact that they use Joey Keithley as a source for a lot of interview material, with no mention that DOA were a Canadian band. Not part of the American Hardcore scene at all. The movie is really just a disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS Hardcore Punk","review":"i've been a part of the punk and harcore scene for 15 years now. this documentary is just what every newcommer needs to see. its a great door into what started it all. i highly recommend this to anyone intersted in understanding where your favorite band came from. my only negative thought is that the movie ends abruptly. after 1985 there were a few more inmportant hardcore bands but they are not mentioned i dont believe the scene just \\"died off\\". this movie obviously focuses on the history of hardcore but it would have been nice to see how some of the second generation bands came about. overall, i loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!","review":"They left out way to much!!

Most of the concert footage was pretty unsatisfying for someone who was there. Bad Brains were depicted well and Keith Morris is always entertaining. The movie title references years 1980-1986 but I am not really sure why the only Gang Green concert footage was from 1987. There was no mention of Dead Kennedys, Social Distortion or Misfits which seemed strange."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much to cover, so little time","review":"This was a very decent documentary focusing on the origins and the centers of the hardcore scene when it was at it's biggest and best. The story unfolds starting in california, and spending much of their time there, but eventually breaks off across the country into regional areas. Unfortunately, there was quite a bit of focus on some smaller less known bands, and omissions of details of the misfits, and husker du and other midwest influential bands. However, the choppyness of this film soley comes from the amount of material it has to try and cram into about 2 hours. The bonus features were nice, and Good Job with the Bad Brains and Black Flag stuff, but not the be-all end all of Punk/Hardcore knowledge. This film does definately catch the spirit of the movement. Definately worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Great book, awesome topic, engaging interviews and cool live footage -- so, why was the movie so disappointing? Maybe it's because it was so disjointed and never put the various scenes in context (especially chronological context). Maybe it's because nearly every interviewee said the same thing -- all fans of hardcore punk were losers/outcasts (not true!), the scene was a reaction against the oppressive climate in the early '80s, including Fleetwood Mac, disco, \\"coke snorting Hollywood types\\" (these parts made me cringe -- so did the interviews with guys like Keith Morris, who reveal themselves in their old age to be inarticulate burnouts). I agree with the other posts as well -- no DKs? no Misfits? no Husker Du?. It's like Hardcore for Dummies, but since the movie never scratches below the surface and never presents the material in a coherent manner, even dummies won't be any smarter about the topic after watching it! Hopefully, someone will do it right one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Two-star rating for the live footage alone. Waaaaay too many douchebags are interviewed. Idiots/burnouts like Bruce Loose, Springa, Vinnie Stigma and Jimmy Gestapo make me embarrassed to be a fan of independent music in general. Jack Grisham is the biggest offender (\\"huh-huh, I'm cool and edgy because I pissed on a passed-out girl\\"). That's not a fault of the film though, as these people were idiots back then too, so it is historically accurate. I can't believe the short-shrift that the midwest got--some of the best bands came from that region. Oh well. Rent it for the footage. Oh, and HR looks really old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important view of musical history....","review":"This is a great and entertaining view of US hardcore.

Interview with some of the very best not to include the clips of some of the best bands playing live.I caught myself singing along to clips but also wondering what happened to the true art of punk. Can't wait for \\"Punk's Not Dead\\" but this will please you in the meantime."},{"rating":"2","title":"choppy, but still worthwhile","review":"Compared to the book, the film really glosses things over and leaves a lot of things out, but I still think it's worth checking out. The fact that there is a documentary devoted exclusively to '80s hardcore makes me happy. At least someone out there is making the effort to document it all before it's too late.I just wish someone would do a more in-depth and definitive document of hardcore's early years. This one gets the job done, but it could be done so much better. As I said, a lot of things were left out and overall, the interviews are kind of choppy, but they did still get some great interviews.All in all, I'd still say it's a decent introduction to hardcore (especially for people who don't already know anything) and it's worth having in your DVD collection to show people, etc. After all, it is a pretty compelling story."},{"rating":"2","title":"good quality","review":"This works well on the Nikon CP8800.

It has good flow, yet it does not feather or bleed through pretty much any paper. I can even use it to do crossword puzzles in most books and newsprint with no feathering or bleeding. Most importantly, this ink is just black. Actually, it's blacker than black. I use it for writing notes and homework solutions. The text is so dark on white paper that I can easily scan my notes and solutions electronically to give to students.A few months ago I dropped my bottle of Noodler's black and broke it.

Albert Camus is one of the most profoundly influential thinkers of this century. The Rebel is a definite must read for lovers of L'etranger and Myth of Sisyphus. Camus maintains his signature style of short, simple yet hard-hitting sentences that leave a lot to the imagination, thus giving the reader a chance to re-create their our vision. One of the best writers to come out of France, Camus' sharp eye toward the French Revolution shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny.

Silas was the only one in the story that I actually looked forward to reading about. Cherish to me was whiny and weak, and I found myself hoping she didn't win the love of Silas until she could change her spoiled ways. Her father did a complete 360 in the story, between paternal love and obsessive protection. He randomly over-reacted about Silas, which was not, in my opinion, part of his nature. The dialogue throughout the book was rushed and forced, the characters were extremely underdeveloped, and the end just left me unsatisfied.

We started a book club last year. This book was the book chosen to be October's read. We haven't had our meeting yet to discuss it, but I thought it was a great story. My only complaint was it became a little dull around the 2nd third or so, but overall the story is wonderful. You can really see Esther grow and come into her own. I honestly didn't expect the ending, but I think it worked well with the story. I feel like this is a great book for young adult readers because of many reasons, but mainly to help those who think they don't fit in realize they are just their own person, and they shouldn't be afraid to be who they are. This would not normally be a book I would just pick up to read, but I'm glad it was chosen as the book club book this month. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I received the book in excellent condition.....I wish I would have received it a little faster as it was for a required Pre-AP English book for my daughter but I would definitely buy from this again!

The sonic quality is variable and mostly horrible--and mono, no less! As Craig Fenton (who should no better than to endorse this with four stars) noted, the order is all mixed up, songs fade in and out. There's distortion on most of the lead vocals. It's just a slipshod deal from beginning to end. Is the music good? Absolutely! But I guarantee you can hear much, much better Airplane from this era (though streaming only) on wolfgangsvault.com or a couple of other past '67 releases. A truly bad, unauthorized bootleg.(I am a lifelong Airplane fanatic and author of several books about the Grateful Dead...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"I'm a huge sci-fi fan and I love Jack Palance and Corky Nemec, but this movie was a snooze fest. The question I have for this talented cast is what the hell were you thinking?! Granted the effects are 20 years old, but the dialogue is laughable, it takes much to long to get into, and to be honest, it was just boring. I kept waiting for something to happen and when it did, I really didn't give a damn. Sorry, but this was terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me:Possibly the only one who liked it...","review":"Yes ladies and gentlemen,there is someone who liked it.ME!I didnt notice any similarities between the ending and 2001.Well okay,some similarities with the FTL sequense but thats it.And Freddy is a bit like HAL9000 but more human.The sub-plot on earth is pretty useless except for the ending.But i liked Jack Palances character.And theres good acting in this movie also,even Charlton Heston is better than they say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of View","review":"The reason I loved this video is the dry humor. The creators might not have meant this to be a feature, but scenes like the robotic transport vehicles, void of human compassion, telling Palance and Nemic to clear the highway made me laugh hysterically. It was a mediocre in terms of plot and pretty good in terms of special effects, but what I perceived as humor, intentional or not, is what made me buy the video.If you cracked up at how in The Greatest American Hero, the instruction book fit into the suit's container very much like an eight-track tape, you might also find yourself laughing at scenes in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Entertainment Crisis' more like.","review":"I saw this DVD on the shelf and thought \\"...wow, sci-fi...and look at the credits.\\" Then I saw the actors...Charlton Heston, Tim Matheson...and the plot seemed somewhat plausible...for the future anyway, so I bought it. Then I watched it the first time, then a second, and a third. I came to the conclusion that this movie was composed entirely of what was on the cutting room floor. The plot was disjointed, the most of the characters were uninspired and unbelievable (especially Matheson who couldn't act his way out of a paper bag), and despite the great special effects (2001 was touted as a credit to the sfx crew) this turkey of a movie couldn't get off the ground...much less to the sun. I give it one because, as they say; 'zero wasn't an option'. If you buy it, play the sound track to 'Event Horizon'...it makes it so much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst SF Movie I ever saw.","review":"It was the first time I ever felt a need to fast forward through a video and even then I couldn't stand to watch it. Fast forwarding through all the action on earth I was dumbfounded by the impossible plot on the space ship.

Because I use it to teach a class, I have had the VHS version for many years. I thought that I would get into the 21st century and buy the DVD, in hopes that I could access the scenes I needed for the class quicker. Because the chapter index is very skimpy, I have to use a combination of the DVD an the VHS tape for the class. It sure beats winding and rewinding to get to the scenes I need but it sure would've been nice to have a bigger index. P.S. - yes, it's an awful movie but I didn't write it or act in it but it paid my rent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A high budget Sci-Fi mess","review":"The first sign that this film is no good is it's directed by \\"Alan Smithee\\". \\"Smithee\\" is a psudonyum for directors who want to disassociate themselves from a finished picture. Too bad the stars didn't have the same luxery: Peter Boyle, Jack Palance, Charlton Heston, Tim Matherson. The hard-to-follow story deals with evacuation of Earth during a probable supernova of the Sun (I think) but what you really get is an unstable bastardization of \\"2001\\" and \\"Road Warrior\\". This film may have impressive special FX but the best visuals in the world don't mean a thing if you don't have a halfway decent story to go with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploding bomb!","review":"I would actually give this \\"film\\" no stars. Quite possibly, next to a few others, this has to be one of the most convuluted, boring and sickening movies to watch. Want the storyline? Refer to the title, and thats about as exstensive as it gets. I own this on laser disc and have wanted to burn it for years.

While I found the Imaginext Castle to be a nice item, I found the Phantom Pirate Ship to be a disappointment. The ship is broken into 3 sections that must be snapped together. The problems are 1. each section is difficult to get to \\"snap\\" securely 2.once together, they snap apart again easily, making it difficult to play with the ship 3. the rails have to be adjusted each time the sections come on and off 4. the only way to get a pirate out of the \\"dungeon\\" is to take that section off the ship then try to fit it back together! The age recommendation is 4-5, and yes, my 3-1/2 yr. old was frustrated with it, but my 6-1/2 yr. old even had trouble with keeping the ship together.

It is helpful for beginners and practioners alike, as it covers a great deal territory on just about any subject you can think of in the psychic arena. Most important of all, it teaches the ethics and responsibilities of being psychic, far too many books leave out this important information, which can lead to all kinds of complications for the unwary. So if you are a seeker, looking for information on being psychic and what it means to be psychic, as well as how to get started on this path, this is your book.

So far today I have been sitting in front of a dead computer for 8 hours waiting for Highpoint to return my tech help call - I have left 5 messages.In order to switch cards I must wipe out all my data.

Like the first nine installments, these episodes get you aquainted with the greats of TF lore, and provide enough familiarity to make watching TF: The Movie the joy it was supposed to be.

No way!I'm surprised Helen Fielding hasn't sued yet. What Fielding did with Bridget Jones is far superior to this obvious knockoff. Emily, the main character here, does little more than spew insights about the previous men in her life. This is not riveting reading, folks. There is none of the sparkling introspection of Bridget Jones, and the fact that Emily has the requisite female friend duo and the gay male sidekick only serves to further diminish the originality of this pale imitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"another book playing on womens' fears","review":"\\"Hollow independence\\"?

No gal's \\"clock\\" should start ticking loudly enough for her to notice until several years beyond 30.

I don't like taking this kind of insulting drivel from another woman, though. \\"No sex equals calls\\"...well, perhaps from men who are equally invested in game playing as the one dimensional scheming women in Gerlach's book.Don't buy the book.

It must be very difficult for an author to make her heroine so unappealing, we wonder why anyone would be attracted to her in the first place, but somehow, the author manages. Her friends are underdeveloped characters and I dont think I need to be told the same \\"reasons why not\\" three times (one list for every guy is okay, but we get THE SAME lists during each chapter, at the end of each chapter, and then again at the end of the book). The only highlight of the book is her connection with Sam, her dog, and even that relationship did not feel \\"real\\" to me when Sam was sick. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book was horrible. I think the editor was on vacation because there were so many grammatical mistakes and sentences that just didn't make sense. The time line of events was disjointed and I never got the feel of how long these relationships actually were. The book had no flow and you found yourself not connecting with any of the characters. Which is odd because the scenarios Emily went through were so universal that you should have been connecting with her. The other characters might as well never even been in the book they were so pale and underdeveloped. Why even put them it? Filling space I guess. The men Emily dated were such stereotypical men that you didn't feel sorry for Emily-- you felt like yelling at her for being so utterly stupid. And to put so much emphasis on sex (which is all she seemed to think a relationship was about) just made her character even more unlikable. I rarely write reviews, but this book was so terrible that I just had to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Dreck","review":"I love well-written chick lit books by the likes of Sophie Kinsella and Emily Giffin. I found Emily's Reasons in the bargain bin at Target and picked it up. The lack of even ONE positive review on the cover or inside the book should have been a tip off (the only endorsement is a lukewarm quote from Brittany Murphy), but I purchased it anyway. As another reviewer noted, the character is unlikable, and the book is so poorly written and edited that it is rendered unreadable. If the TV show was as bad as the book, it's no wonder it was cancelled after one ep. The bigger mystery is who was dumb enough to option this tome as a TV series . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?!?!?","review":"This book wanted to make me scream.

Then later on the robots getting eaten alive by robot sharks, and the robots being melted alive in acid was a shock. But I still watched it so much I wore right through my VHS tape. Now, when I watch it, I love the music.. if you're trying to explain what \\"1980's Hair Metal\\" is to someone, this is the PERFECT music to use. It's awesome!

It was just a two hour commercial to kill off all the cool, old Transformers and make kids want the new ones. In the begining, every shot megatron fires kills an old autobot. By the end of the flick, the new guys are dodging bullets left and right. Optimus Prime dies valiantly, which is a serious, touching moment and could have set the tone for a great film. However, any integrity the film has is destroyed when the new transformers break out into a \\"weird al\\" music montage set to \\"dare to be stupid.\\" All the new characters are lame and annoying. The plot is pointless. The level of violence is near pornographic and toatly innapropriate for kids, which is this movie's target demographic. This movie is an insult to the spirit of Optimus Prime.

If you've never seen these movies they are a must see. They are better then the cartoons now-a-days and the story line of the 2 movies are better then any Pokemon or Power Rangers episode.

There are plenty of other animated movies from that era that are ten times better than this. I stopped halfway through watching this with my kids because I just couldn't bear it any longer. The animation is poor, but I can write that off to its age. The story is horrendous, with plot holes too numerous to count. On top of that, right in the middle of this movie I thought was geared for kids one guys yells an expletive at the top of his lungs. I don't recommend this for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"how to TRANSFORM a good movie into a bad one","review":"I was really looking forward in seeing this movie.

The good news is, they dropped the scrolling intro. Unfortunately, there's nothing else to really set this appart. No letterbox, no deleted scenes that I could notice (no profanity), and next to no special features. The interview with Vince diCola was alright, though his voice was pretty annoying. The storyboards of deleted scenes left me wanting more. They had about a dozen shots. Most made little sense.

You have a newly remastered movie(IN WIDESCREEN), tons of extras like commentaries, original commercials in both america and japan, and also you get to see the \\"lost\\" episode that was never aired in america. It was the last episode right before the movie(which tied the series to the movie a lot better). This is definitely the best edition of the movie to have come out so far, especially for hardcore fans.

It had all the orginal characters : Optimus Prime. Megatron, Ironhide, and Starscream. It was terrible to see them die. But this film actually started the post-movie series of the show. It featured the new characters. The next Autobot leader, Rodimus Prime! It was great to see Judd Nelson's character Hot Rod mature into the adult Robot, Rodimus Prime!

RP is called Rodimus Convoy in Japan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a true Widescreen Format!!!","review":"Transformers The Movie is my favorite animated movie of all time. I was excited to learn this 20th anniversary edition was coming out. When I played it, I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great, and is worthy of all 5 stars. My low rating is because of the \\"widescreen format.\\" The 16:9 format is NOT the theatrical version. It is merely the full screen version with the top and bottom trimmed off. If you don't believe me, look at the full screen version side by side with the \\"wide screen\\" version. It does have some great extra features, and the color is cleaned up, but this is not what is advertised on the box. If you are purchasing this for the full screen version or the special features, you'll be fine, but if you want the true widescreen version, you will be disappointed like me. Buyers beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big movie in little package, awesome.","review":"This great Transformers movie is great, they put an expansive story/episodes into one movie.

This movie was moving because it brought some reality to the whole shoot-em-up aspect of transformers. It also started the change in transformers the show. It brought in some characters into places where nobody would've guessed they'd be. It was a dark movie, some points were really dark to a point where you wonder if this was aimed at kids or adults. since i am now technically an adult with the mind of a kid, it doesn't matter....but watch this movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Animated Film Of Our Time.","review":"MEGATRON MUST BE STOPPED.

I wish the new characters didn't have to be introduced by killing off the favorite characters. It was awful to see fire spewing out of Prowl's mouth, when he was killed. And Ironhide's head being blown off by Megatron. I just saw the Kid Rhino DVD, and it was the sorriest way to bring a classic movie to DVD. The colors were too bright, and the animation was choppy. Besides the interview with the composer of the music, this DVD didn't have any features. It was just sloppily thrown together, just to get a DVD of the movie out there. I hope in the future, Paramount (Who is filming the new Transformers movie) gets in touch with Marvel/Sunbow, and re-release the original film, complete with trailers from the original film, plus toy commercials, featuring the movie characters. This is one movie, Kid Rhino, should have never put their hands on. This DVD sucked!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: No Japanese language audio track.","review":"Subject says it all.

I was in high school when they came out in the early '80s. Hey, I love cartoons. But in '86, the Transformers started to change in the series, and it continued in the movie.Unless you love everything about the Transformers don't see this movie. If you love the cartoon before Optimus Prime dies, don't see this movie.I gave it two stars, because unlike the other reviewers, I saw it in the theatre when it came out in the summer of '86. The price was worth it to see the cartoon in a wide screen and with the dolby-enhanced sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep the memory, not the movie.","review":"Starting with an all-star cast of voiceover actors, such as Judd Nelson, Robert Stack, Orson Wells, Scatman Crothers, Casey Kasem, and Leonard Nimoy, this is the movie that set the pace for future anime. It's the year 2005, and the Decepticons have taken Cybertron from Optimus Prime, and the Autobots, and their battle to save earth from the Unicrons, and the Decpticons. The Chosen one must take Optimus's place, and open the matrix. As a kid, I loved this movie. After seeing it now, at my age, I realize how bad it was. I think kids will love it, but as an adult, you won't want to sit and watch it with your kids. Move on to something from Japan like Princess Mononoke, or Ghost in the shell for a movie you'll all love."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Transformers - The Movie DVD","review":"I bought this DVD Because I really liked the original series and actually have been waiting for the movie to come out on DVD. When I got it home to watch it I was somewhat disappointed as to the quality of the video. I am not a video/audio expert but I do know a good picture when I see one. The sound was good. I would have thought that the Features on the DVD would have been better. While the interview with the music composer was there interesting in some spots I found the whole thing B-O-R-I-N-G ! The director would have been better. If you but this DVD then do it for the movie sake. Not for any thing else and be willing to be satisfied with the movie alone or buy the video tape if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"TFS The Movie has a terrible story that imitated Star Wars.","review":"Star Wars was a much better movie. This is a terrible, distructive film full of nonsense violence and distruction. The film kills many beloved Autobot characters such as Optimus Prime, Prowl, Ratchet,Ironhide, Brawn, and Windcharger. This film shows the darkside of Transformers to parents who want to see this film with their childern. Without any knowledge about how good the T.V.Show is to kids, parents assume the entire film represents the franchise. The only positive things about this film is that it has beatiful Japanese Animation and Leonard Nimoy plays one of the voices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointed!!!! Curse Words!!!!","review":"I purchased this movie for my 7 year old twin boys birthday thinking that because it said the rating was PG that it would be fine. Also, the market for Transformers is huge with boys their age and the toys being sold everywhere. Wow, were we hugely surprised to hear curse words on this cartoon movie. These were not just words like shoot or dang, but the real deal. I remember Transformers when I was growing up and I certainly do not remember their being foul language in the cartoons. I am going to take this matter up with higher management and at least get my money back and try find out what they were thinking.

I own the UNEDITED canadian version (the one with the famous \\"Oh, sh*t\\" scene). I wonder if that's the one that amazon is selling. Anyway, this movie is awesome, Bumblebee is in it, Hot Rod.

So I pop in the first disc and start playing. I then start to realize...this isn't a true widescreen version! It's just the full screen version reformated to play on a 16x9 television! And actually when you compare them side by side, the widescreen version cuts off some of the image.Sure the colors are separated more but really I think I liked the colors of the original better. Sometimes the new version just seemed...washed out. The original had deeper reds and looked more natural. I was kind of used to Unicron being almost orange and not yellow.Some of the extras are good, but not overly exciting. If you are looking for the true theatrical widescreen version prepare to be disappointed. Oh well now I have 2 full screen versions and 1 full screen version that plays natively on a widescreen tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"greatest movie ever!!!","review":"I am 27 almost 28 and I remember this movie when I was a kid.

The characters are well developed and the action is intense. Sycophant or not, I cannot think of a more worthy big screen adaptation of an animated television series.

That's good since MKSAP 2 was well made. There were several things I liked about MKSAP. It covered a variety of illnesses and grouped them by symptom (so if you felt weak in pulmonary you could easily find sections applicable to that field). The American College of Physicians wrote it, which is quite comforting. It references appropriate research articles for every Q&A.; Finally, like a shelf, it forced you to make tough decisions. In reality, you order just above every lab and whatever imaging you need to cover yourself. Board questions, though, make you choose the best test from what you would always order.I preferred using the CD-ROM with the book (well made) as I could do questions much faster rather than flipping through a book.MKSAP 3 is slightly better than 2 in that it does reference more recent materials and protocols, and it seems to repeat certain concepts less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I highly recommend using this book during your internal medicine rotation. The questions are shorter than those on the actual shelf exam, but they require the same thought process.

The same can be said of the questions in MKSAP 3. Another nice feature is that the book comes with a CD with all of the questions. This allows you to keep better track of your progress and to take the questions in a random mode, rather than just subject-based.

Neither should religious beliefs. I, for one, am perfectly happy to have my religious beliefs kept out of science classrooms. I don't need science to tell me there is a God. I don't need - or want - my religious beliefs to force science to be conducted in a certain way.

My Ph.D. is in linguistics and I have taught or directly supervised instruction in over two dozen languages. Each language is an extremely, elaborately complex, multi-systemic structure. Two thousand years ago, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, etc., didn't exist. They exist today, each as a highly complex structure, but none was created, nor was its direction of development directed by anyone. Each simply evolved from spoken Latin; the evolution of each is known and documented.

Pity the poor cast as they try to maintain the illusion that the ghoulish, octagenerian Ms. West is some kind of a sex symbol. Run for ear plugs as she and Mr. Dalton mutilate \\"Love will keep us together\\" (not the best song to begin with but it deserves better than this). Recoil in horror as the reanimated corpse of Mae West spouts sexual innuendos that were stale 60 years before this film was made!Of course, even without Ms. West dottering around the set this movie would be unwatchable. The screenplay is dreck and it was seemingly directed by Helen Keller.I watched this movie on a dare, and I'm convinced that God has knocked some time of my upcoming sentence in Purgatory because of it.

After watching this film, it's easier to understand why she was Billy Wilder's first choice.This film has to be the first commercial venture of a star losing all touch with reality. Mae doesn't do anything she hasn't done before, and she does it as she always did, but she's living in a world where time and space no longer exist.She's in her eighties. She wears false fingernails and a gaudy array of wigs. Her waistline is non-existent. Her face is sagging and her voice is cracking. She exhibits all the usual attributes of a senior citizen. But the producer, the director, and her co-stars have apparently decided to give the old lady one last charitable send off, and she must have gone to her grave happy. But any discerning viewer has to see it as documented evidence of a great star who's lost all touch with reality and could be considered clinically insane."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke of a DVD!","review":"For those who are true Mae West fans this may be the only opportunity to see Sextette on DVD. If you don't want to dish out $10 to see one of the worst transfers in DVD history (and Rhino reps admitted to blindly obtaining a poor print), then buy this one on VHS! The tape is 10 times better in sight and sound than the disc (shouldn't that be the other way around?) and is still available.As for the movie itself, it's a joke but a true CAMP and CULT Classic. Paramount pictures originally made this movie and was so embarrased by it that they shelved it before releasing it! An independent Canadian movie company saved it from destruction. Rather that was a good thing depends on your interest in Mae West."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embalmed Cinema","review":"If you want to see Mae West strut her stuff at age 85, step right this way!

I was embarrassed for the actors. This movie goes beyond camp. Very disappointing.I purchased this movie while I was working in the Middle East and as far as I know, its still in some land fill over there. I gave it 1 star only because there isn't a lower rating. Mae West once said that she didn't want Myra Breckinridge to be her last film. Much better than this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch...","review":"If you're a big fan of Mae West,I suggest you get her movies when she was in her prime,but not when she was in her 80's and still acting like she was back then.Why would a 30 something year old man like Timothy Dalton be attracted to an 80 year old woman in the first place?? An 80 year old woman arousing a young man?? Yeah,right..If you like camp or bad movies,then this right up your alley.This is bad all the way around.Bad comedies and bad musicals don't go together for one thing.Maybe separately,but not this.Do you really want to see Mae and Timothy sing \\"Love Will Keep Us Together\\"?? Not me.Everyone involved ought to be ashamed.From Alice Cooper to Regis Philbin to Tony Curtis to the director and the writer.No wonder this movie bombed.It belongs right along side \\"Can't Stop the Music\\".See Mae West when she could pull off the sexual innuendos back in her prime,but this?This is plain embarrassing and painful..YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SEXTETTE: Don't Let This Happen To You!","review":"That Greta Garbo retired from films in her mid thirties did more to keep her memory and \\"the mystique\\" alive than anything else she could have done. That Mae West decided to film \\"Sextette\\" in the late Seventies, when she was in her mid eighties, is the flip side of Garbo: the Baby-Jane-Norma-Desmond syndrome descended upon a new world with new values. And to pair West with the young Timothy Dalton and expect the audience to take the romance seriously further complicates this already messy film. Part musical, part comedy, part Grand Guignol, this film should be seen for the five-star lesson it presents: know when to gracefully retire, leaving only the fondest of memories, Garbo-like, captured on film forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp-Fest ala Mae","review":"I'm amazed this many other people have seen this movie! I loved it! Mae in glorious technicolor reviving Diamond Lil is fantastic! The entire movie is hilarious, probably not in the way that Mae intended, but I'm sure she's happy to get a laugh.

This is also the only movie you see her drink alcohol in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lady Gaga, eat your heart out","review":"Based upon Depression-era original play, this incredible vehicle for the Legendary Mae West, is firmly planted in the disco seventies: even Rockmen Ringo Starr and Keith Moon seem at ease with the proceedings.A huge cast of past and present greats (with a terrific cameo by a lean and mean George Raft!) is featured in this wild story of the ultimate diva in a British Hotel, never quite finding time to consummate her marriage: the place is crawling with Diplomats (and ex-husbands). Will a cassette tape of her \\"memoirs\\" shake up the world?Along for the ride is the actor who played \\"Mr. Pitt\\" on Seinfeld.Fun soundtrack with mostly reworked conetmporary hits. Mae sings well, especially on \\"After You've Gone\\".By the way, Mae, at 85, is superb. If her illness at the time was an issue, it's not apparent in her many scenes; in fact, she dominates the film, delivering classic lines, throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD DVD","review":"Well, ya get what you pay for! And ten bucks ain't gonna get ya much! Not in this case anyway. Watchable print but faded color and really BAD sound with loud buzz. But if your a West fan you better grab it.

The movie is stupid and silly, butit is amazing to watch Mae in her 80's, with all those heavycostumes strugglin thru her lines. Above all, the movie is just'silly fun'.

Every chapter is devoted to a key feature of the language (as opposed to discussing all data types in one chapter, for example) and Mr. Petzold's teaching style is wonderfully accessable without at all being too simple.I read this book as my first attempt at learning C#, and it provided such a solid foundation that now I am much more comfortable reading other books and documents that deal with more advanced topics and that take a lot of the basics for granted.

For beginners only!","review":"If I were a beginning programmer, I would give this book 4.5 stars. I gave this book a poor rating because it does not clearly state its intended audience, which are beginning programmers.

We meet his sons and follow their adventures as well-- the book is best when it looks at the African tribes that must deal with white encroachment in the latter part of the 19th century. Smith writes gritty adventures/soap operas that entertain and inform, and while this one is good, it's not quite up to the standards of the Courtney novels, beginning with \\"Birds of Prey.\\" Read that one first; if it piques your interest, you'll want to read the next 11 books in that series, then come back to try the Ballantynes...."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars.","review":"The steep scar was called The Devil's Own.

This is a combination crime and fantasy story, a time-travel theme employed as a son is able to talk to his father 30 years in the past and help change history for the better. Far-fetched? Oh, of course, but it's not meant to be taken seriously as something that could happen. Like \\"Field Of Dreams,\\" it's pure fantasy but a nice father-and-son vehicle that makes you - or at least it did me - bring a tear or two to your eyes.The young guy is played by Jim Caviel and his dad is played by Dennis Quaid.

It is 1999, and Frank died fighting a fire in 1969.But we believe it. The charm of Frequency is that the relationship between the two (Frank is Dennis Quaid and John Jim Cazaviel) is so strong, the time travel seems almost plausible. As soon as they establish that they are indeed in touch--they use plays of the Mets '69 World Series to verify- both take advantage: first to save the father from the fire, and his Camel Cigarettes, to catch a killer.I won't reveal much more plot, but the 1969 scenes have amazingly real detail, and the father son friendship is genuinely touching to watch.This is an example of how science fiction should be done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to the past to the future to the past to the future, and so on...","review":"Looks like everybody enjoyed this film.

Overlook the few loopholes that are in the plot. I'm not going to point them out because that's petty. This is a very suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. It might also raise a lump or two in your throat. Lost opportunities and second chances is what this story is all about. And it does do a very good job handling the many pitfalls that can arise in a time travel story. It's well worth ones time to watch this movie. It's good to see a science fiction story that keeps it's sense of humanity. The special effects and hardware are not only secondary they're almost non-exsistent. Great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie, kind of unexpected","review":"Frequency is a very good movie. It's entertaining and suspenseful the entire way through. The actings great and the story's even better.I'll admit that the beginning of the film starts off kind of slow. They really try to develope the characters in a great way. There are a few moments were I wonder why it wasn't edited better. After the first 40 minutes the movie really picks up and it doesn't stop until the end.Quaid gives the performance of his career. Caviezel puts on an excellent show in his role. Andre Braugher gives an outstanding performance also. There were a few weak performances, but not many.It's a great story. One that really draws you in each second you watch. Definitely worth a rent or buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am moved to tears.","review":"I like family-love movie very much. From the view point of a father, this movie is excellent. In the movie Frank saved his son, John, who was just murdered, at the last scene. I was moved by the great love of a father. Probably I wouldn't show my love to my sons as much as Frank. In Japan mothers usually take care of children and fathers aren't good at showing their love to family members. So a father tends to be isolated from his family. Of course I am always concerned about my family. But I don't tell them my concerns directly. So my affections aren't handed to them.I think Frank is a father of fathers. I try to imitate Frank. The movie tells me an important role of a father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow - a suspense in two time zones","review":"This is a thriller that keeps moving very very fast and weaves the complexities of two parallel time lines quite well. Viewers have to follow this and keep track of all the cause and effects but it works. Frequency is an interesting take on all the \\"what ifs\\" of life - sometimes we get so addicted to the idea that the other ending would have been better. When in fact, changing the past, present, or future ... may be worse! In the end, maybe everything that does happen is in fact - perfect despite how painstaking it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful film.","review":"I saw this on the night it opened, and the theater was packed. I'm not normally a science-fiction fan, so I was leery of going, but I had seen clips of the film at Shea Stadium, where Dennis Quaid came to promote it and to throw out the first pitch on \\"Turn back the clock night.\\" My friend and I decided we simply had to see it.To say \\"we laughed, we cried\\" doesn't quite capture the emotions this movie evokes. Quaid and Caviezel are both wonderful. It is impressive that they could have so much chemistry while only appearing on screen together for a few seconds. As a lifelong Mets fan, I love how they prove they're telling the truth by describing what happened in the 1969 World Series.I cannot say how much I loved this movie. I call it a combination of Field of Dreams and Back to the Future. It has baseball, parent/child bonding, and time travel. What more could you want?"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY ENTERTAINING MIX OF SCI-FI, CRIME STORY AND DRAMA!","review":"An interesting idea that blends family and crime drama with sci-fi elements to make a highly entertaining movie \`Frequency' is one of the most entertaining films of its kind. Quaid and Caviezel hand in very good performances and make the unbelievable, well.... believable. Usually these types of films can be confusing and tedious, but because the center story about a boy losing his firefighter father at an early age is heartfelt, it makes up for any minor plot holes. Look fast for a young Michael Cera as John's son. The DVD has an excellent transfer and there are some interesting extras including commentary, deleted scenes and feature-ettes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much beter than I expected...","review":"Nice surprise! This flick had much more depth than I had expected and had a really interesting and well-executed plot line. The movie doesn't get all bogged down in the \\"how this happed\\" aspect but instead just sets the rules and jumps right in. Quaid shines as the father. I'm not one to get emotional at movies...but was glad I had a handkerchief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous movie with a great ending!!","review":"I can't remember the last movie I've seen where I actually cheered at the climax of it, but this is it. The ending happens in such a fast-paced manner that you can't figure out what's going to happen until it's actually happening! Very few movies keep me guessing until the end - and fewer still surprise me - but this one did both. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie will make you cry","review":"this movie is the best there is. it makes you think \\"if i could go back in time what would i change?\\" to anyone who has lost a loved one this movie will touch your heart and make you wish your loved ones were with you. the movie also has a beautiful soundtrack everyone should see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unusual Twist on Cinematic Time Travel That Doesn't Seem to Understand Itself","review":"An odd twist on time distortion in which, due to the inexplicable appearance of the aurora borealis over Queens, a New York cop is able to communicate via ham radio with his long-dead father thirty years in the past. Completely ignoring the warnings of Doc Brown and Marty McFly, he immediately spoils the upcoming World Series and dozens of important life moments for his father, before the two decide to pair up in search of an unresolved string of historical murders. The film can't decide if it wants to do the sappy paternal bonding thing or follow a more suspenseful path, and its main plot mechanism is clunky, under-explained and inconsistent. It's also routinely telegraphed from beginning to end, with a narrow scope limiting its potential escape routes and an overdose of father-son baseball allegories. Hackneyed, hammy and haphazard, it plays like a bloated sci-fi short story in desperate need of revision."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was worse for Dennis than Meg Ryan....","review":"I saw this movie when on vacation in Utah. I could not believe a talent like Dennis Quaid was wasted in a go-nowhere movie like this.I have seen Dennis Quaid in several films, and I have to say the only thing watchable about this film is his performance in it. His co-star is wooden, and unbelievable. The plot was not written well enough to hold my interest, even as an action movie.Go rent this before you spend the money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you do not want to be confused, DO NOT see this.","review":"At 16 maybe im too young to appreciate this type of movie but i realy didnt like it. When i first saw it at the movies i came out feeling very boared, confused and thought i was missing something. So when i had the oppotunity to see it again i thought i might understand it more. Nope i was just as confused and parts of this movie just do not fit together. From its advertising it sounded realy good, but its not what i thought it would be. I give it 2 stars for the good acting and the good parts here and there but thats all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot holes galore and excessive sentimentality","review":"There are some interesting ideas in this film. It does try to be a father and son story, but somehow gets caught in the murky confusion of a temporal story gone awry. There are several plot holes, and no matter how seemingly compelling the father and son story gets, we can't ignore them.If you are like me and can't overlook cheesy, all too convenient solutions to problems, and plethoras of plot holes, you probably would be best off avoiding this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good opener but I quickly lost interest","review":"whatever these reviewers are on, I want some. This movie dragged. I kept waiting for something cool to happen, but they just kept talking to eachother over the mic-bla bla bla blaaa. I wouldn't know if the conversation was good because I just fastforwarded all of it after a while. A real bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, bad execution.","review":"This film suffers from some of the worst old-age make-up I've ever seen in a modern film -- so fake looking that its distracting! This film also suffers from that long-standing cliche of the hero being saved at the last minute by the mystery gunshot out of nowhere. I hate that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Climatic!","review":"You will be at the edge of your seat from beginning to the end. One of the best action films I've watched in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Now this is a kind of movie you don't come across everyday. A movie with a plot that is well thought out and executed even better. This movie is a lot like Back to the Future but on a more serious note. I love the way they show events in the past affecting events in the future and Dennis Quaid's performance is top notch as usual. I think he's getting to be one of my favourite actors (any one seen him in Dragonheart, he was awesome)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely phenomenal","review":"I saw this movie when it first came out in the theaters, and I remember literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I promised myself I'd buy it the minute it because available.Fast forward to 2007, and I finally got around to buying it in July. It's as good as I remembered! From the vivid imagery to the soul-stirring music, this film pulls you in from the start.I know it's one I'll be watching again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller/Drama/Time Travel Tale","review":"Combining the 'moving' nature of great dramas with the excitement and tension of great thrillers, \\"Frequency\\" is about a grown son (policeman Jim Caviezel) connecting over shortwave radio with his father (Dennis Quaid) thirty years in the past, shortly before the latter died. Communicating through time, the son manages to prevent the father's death but finds history changed, with the mother of the family now the one who died early and threats emerging to more members of the family in both time periods. Comes off completely believable with great acting and storyflow, highly effective cinematography in the firefight and chase-type scenes, and sparsely used but masterful special effects. Has one of the more riveting climaxes out there, finishing things off with a grand slam. In the spirit and mood of such greats as \\"Ghost\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"a really good movie!","review":"Despite the suppossed flaws, this is a great movie! Since all films require us to enter the world of the characters, the problems with the inconsistent science behind the film matters little to me. Or perhaps, it's that we have to be able to explain every bit of a movie like this, or we feel it fails. NOT TRUE...Watch this movie. The son and father relationship is really solid and makes the movie both an emotional and exciting trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth watching!","review":"For those of you who missed this film in the theatres, now you have the chance to see one of the most under-rated films of the year. This movie really makes me think about family, and how we often take it forgranted. Sure thats a little sappy, but this story really gets to me. It asks the question, what if you could change the past, and how would it affect the present. Now I don't have anything major I would want to change at this point in my life, but still, the premise is neat to think about. The story has a wierd angle to the reasons behind this strange occurance, some may get turned off this movie because of it, but if you take the movie for what it is, I'm sure you will really enjoy it as I do. The dvd contains some interesting extra features as well, which made this worth purchasing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ending!","review":"I watched this movie years ago and just purchased the DVD from Amazon. I loved it as much as the first time I saw it. Very exciting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I enjoyed the ending very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"great story line and what a twist, keeps you on your feet and keeps you thinking, the ending was very nice"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a suprise!","review":"I didn't expect much of this movie but I was pleasantly suprised. This movie actually touched me. This is something that rarely happens because I am usually into action movies like Predator and Die Hard. I wish I saw this one in the theater. I'm glad to have it on Dvd though. The extras are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Hollywood","review":"At LAST! - Hollywood has produced a movie that says the father has an important role in his son's life. WONDERFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Intense!","review":"WoW! Great movie! Ok... its a tad hooky and it moves a little slow... (Just a little) but there are parts that keep you watching the whole way through that are just intense!!! Of course when the plot begins to unfold you are on the edge of your seat the rest of the way and the ending is unbelievable! I was just amazed at how wonderfully entertaining and clever the entire movie was. If you watch this movie STAY FOR THE END because this movie makes you feel great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film, If You Don't Think About It","review":"Frequency is a movie that entertains, thrills, and stimulates, but all that can be ruined if you think too much about it. Dennis Quaid plays Frank Sullivan, a firefighter killed in a fire in 1969. Thirty years later, his son, John (played by James Caviezel), finds his father's old ham radio. Through the miracle of the Aurora Borealis (how many of THOSE do you see in New York?), they manage to talk to each other through the ages. Through this communication, John saves his father's life, but he changes history so that a famous murderer is back on the lam, and he is going to kill John's wife. So far, so good. But soon after, inconsistencies pop up. All in all however, this movie is a fine story that was short-changed in the theatres. I would recommend it to anybody who likes these kind of cross-time magical movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I just wanted to say that I, too, thoroughly enjoyed this movie. From start to finish, it truly keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is one of the few movies that moves me in that special way - the kind where you brace yourself every time the scene changes. From the very first scene, the suspense does not stop. It's the first movie in quite a while to make me feel this way. Eight thumbs up to its creators."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super-sappy ho-hum.","review":"The movie would have been shorter by at least half an hour without those overdone slow motions overflowing with mega-sap. Overall hokey and unconvincing; terrible example of overdone Hollywood sentimentality with dramatic musical score overkill. Forgettable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"There must be loop holes in this film but it was so darn good I wont even bother looking for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ride Worth taking","review":"Some movies you can't wait for to get over, this movie leaves you wanting more when it's over. It's a fantastic ride between a father and son in a constantly changing plot. I have watched this movie a half dozen times and each time I am wanting to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST SAY WOW","review":"AN AWESOME MOVIE!JUST WHEN YOU THINK THE PROBLEM IS SOLVED THERE COMES ANOTHER TWIST WHICH KEEPS YOU ON PINS AND NEEDLES. HELD MY ATTENTION FROM START TO FINISH. ONE OF THE BETTER FILMS I'VE SEEN AND ONE I WILL WATCH MUCH MORE THAN ONCE. 5 STARS FOR THE CREATIVITY OF THE WRITER. HARD TO GET OUT OF YOUR MIND FOR DAYS AFTER SEEING IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cinematic Vision of Sun Ra","review":"The early-1970s was a tumultuous time in American politics and the world landscape. Sun Ra weaves the political controversies with sci-fi and mythology for this 82 minute film that had a very limited run when initially released in 1974. There is a universal message in Sun Ra's production, with the music - released in a soundtrack - making for an outstanding package.Though available in often shoddy bootlegs, this DVD is a fitting tribute to the cinematic vision of an artistic genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mix of history and hollywood","review":"I caught this movie on WGN afternoon movie a few weeks ago. I have been to Cocoa Beach and took the NASA then and now tour featuring many of the sites in this movie.This movie moves along pretty fast and is entertaining as well as informitive for kids about early NASA history even though it really is just a hollywood movie.Not to be missed, a great family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intrigue, adventure, exciting- you get it all","review":"I loved this book. I've read the entire series of the main character, Cat, but Catspaw I believe is best in the series. What's more, the book can stand alone. The unique writing kept me interested the entire journey, with the 1st person view of the main character, but his abilities to read minds lets you have the perspective of other characters in the book as well. I liked Cat's personality. He's real, with flaws, and fears, and yet does the right thing without being a do-gooder. Even the villians in the book seem real, and you can almost- but not quite- understand why they are the way they are.This story encompasses Cat being pressed into service to be a body guard for a political member of the very government he hates. You get political intrigue, a hint of romance, and a splendid view of a futuristic world with a well thought out plot. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Catspaw","review":"I thought this was the most accurately thought out science fiction novel I had ever read. It showed the dark side of the future that so many other novels tend to 'cure' with out losing the beauty of the charactors. This was the first novel I had read in this trilogy and it stands alone as it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"Cat is so amazing, I find myself wishing he is a real person. It is so easy to fall in love with this marvolus character. (even though this book is in no way a romance novel)So read it and fall in love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely awesome and vivid!","review":"This book has to be the best of the \\"Cat\\" series. The main man in the book, Cat, makes you want to love him, slap him, and then cry for him. Moving and so full of twists and turns it leaves you hanging word for word 'till the very end. A MUST for any sci-fi fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH Better Book than \\"Psion\\"","review":"\\"Catspaw\\" is a MUCH better book than its prequel, \\"Psion.\\" As with \\"Psion,\\" I don't care much for its theme that humans, especially wealthy powerful ones, are evil. But, for \\"Catspaw,\\" that's pretty much overridden by how well Vinge writes and by the tightness of the plot. About the only thing I didn't like in the book was the occasional lapse into unnecessary sexual details in about five different places. Other than that, this is a very well-written book that I highly recommend. If it weren't for the sense of loss a reader would suffer without having read \\"Psion,\\" I'd suggest skipping that book entirely. Most of the necessary information comes out in this book. But, it's not complete until almost halfway through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating character study; a fun read.","review":"I was leery when my fiance shoved Catspaw under my nose and insisted I read it; the cover art and the back-cover description made it sound exceptionally cheesy.Time for me to eat crow: it was a really good book. Taken from a literary standpoint, Catspaw is a fascinating look at our own world, and our own self-imposed limitations. Taken as sci-fi, it's refreshingly original in its presentation of common sci-fi/cyberpunk themes. Moreover, it's just a fun, quick read. If you're looking for some modern sci-fi that's not just popcorn, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't read it","review":"Pics are nifty. Watch Coal Miner's Daughter. Don't try to read this book.

There's only a little action right near the end, the focus is definitely on what is, essentially, a giant game of chess between the CIA and the KGB, with agents trying to outwit and outthink one another.Although there could be a little confusion at times (the translations from Russian weren't always clear, and two similar characters share the same name), I certainly didn't see any evidence of anti-Semitism as was claimed. For the most part I am highly satisfied with this Soviet spy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry.com is a Scam!","review":"Hmm...My wife is ALSO the first poem in the book!? If you look close, one finds that they bound in the first few pages after the fact. It seem that anyone who submits a poems and then buys the book gets the first page.

Paul Richards gives the coaching and managers inside line on handling pitchers, pitch selection, \\"Dusters\\" & \\"Spitters\\", catcher strategy, defensive plays, signs & signals, various batting and base running strategies, and more.

It finishes introducing all the main characters (except the bad guys) and shows some of their crazy life on earth. It contains episodes 5-7. Episode 5 is mainly a halarious introduction for Mihoshi's partner, Kione. 6 shows them as they try to cope with life on earth. And 7 is about a carnaval that goes very very wrong due to the strange booths set up by some of the characters.

Overall this was a good buy. My friend loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"please look for a better source than SRW","review":"Those of us in the pagan/wiccan community rarely take Silver RavenWolf's writings as serious in nature, as her writings are filled with condescending tone, advice to lie for teens, and an obvious gimmick to make money without any regard for gaining credibility for the pagan community. If you are looking for credible resources, look to Scott Cunningham, Raymond Buckland, Christopher Penczak, Ellen Dugan, but if you see Silver RavenWolf RUN the other way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ideal by a longshot","review":"Solitary Witch is a collection of information, some good, some bad, spliced together with Silver Ravenwolf's quick-fix low theology Wicca lite.I gave it two stars, instead of one, because it shows that perhaps Ravenwolf has been listening to her community. She still gets many things wrong-NOT ALL WITCHES ARE WICCAN, for example, but she seems to be trying.I would recommend anything by Cunningham, Buckland or Dunwich above this book, but if you are a teen who, for whatever reason, feels you need a dumbed down teen book, this is heads and tails over \\"Teen Witch\\" for quality.That being said, I feel the target age for this book is about 11-12, and I'm not sure it's appropriate for that age. As a mother of teens, if I gave it to my girls, they'd be offended.That, with all the other problems with Ravenwolf makes this a good book to pass over.Kids don't need Wicca dumbed down or misrepresented, they are just as capable of reading Cunningham as any of us old farts."},{"rating":"2","title":"All the Basics There are to Know Pressed Between Two Covers","review":"Silver RavenWolf seems to be either loved or reviled. I think perhaps the reviling is based on jealousy. Silver has produced many books that have helped others get a toehold in Witchcraft with books that are easy to read and practical. Solitary Witch is a huge undertaking. Silver explains difficult concepts, addresses the needs of the Solitaire, and provides detailed rituals and explanations that should be useful to anyone who has an interest in Witchcraft but either has to work alone or prefers to. Get over the fact that Silver has been a successful writer about the religion she loves. That's not a crime, you know. Cover up her name if you must and open your mind long enough to take an objective look at what a wonderful resource she has created. I believe this book will still be being used when all of us are dead and gone. \\"Hi Ho, Silver!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't realize that I was a teenager....","review":"I detest this book.First of all, I do not appreciate reading a book with such a condescending tone. I mean, spells to make your parents happy? Locker protection spells?Secondly, through cross referencing, I have found many errors in the tables of correspondences.

Practice the Craft in seeeeecret, like a good little liar.\\" I hate that. Be proud of what you've chosen. Don't let anyone tell you that you can't be open in your beliefs.

This woman speaks of Christianity more than any other book I've seen. I've actually met one of her friends who say she gets a lot of grief for this. It's for a reason!!! I was told this was for Tolerance amongst religions...to I dunno say cover all her basis. Tolerance is great...I have many Christian friends...but when it comes down to it there is no point in trying to blend it with an already complicated religion. I myself am not Wiccan....I am Celtic Pagan...but have study both paths for 11 years. I've said my piece the choice is yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"I honestly believe that paganism, religion whatever you want to call it is about bettering yourself. Not begging to diety to give you everything you want. Silver claims to belive the same thing but then provides spells for love and money. How many books does she need to publish on the same information. It seems to me that she is just trying to get her 15 minutes of fame, and make a bunch of money. There is nothing new in this book that makes it a 'must read'. If you want an introduction Paganism: An Introduction to Earth-Centered Religions by Joyce and River Higginbotham is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely-Compiled.","review":"I have an eclectic taste in my reading material and I was hoping this book would present a neat atmospheric tableau upon which the author spun her \\"facts\\" about this topic, but I didn't find much that was impressive, cool, informative, or even suitably moody about Solitary Witch. In short, I'm sorry to say it was a bit of a letdown. EXCEPT man that cover is wild! Might I make the suggestion that better packaging would help a future edition? By that I mean dress up the interior with art and design that matches the grand cover. That would really spark this tome up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look both ways then cross the road.","review":"Please, everyone thinking of buying this book stop beforehand and do a little research on Silver Ravenwolf. Go to any search engine and type in her name. The many misrepresentations in her books as well as the inconsistancies and flat out lies should be taken into account before you decide if you want to purchase any of her books or not.I say again:Do yourself a favor and look up this author before making any purchases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok.I don't own this book but read a friends copy.","review":"I never really liked Ravenwolf's work.It teaches to the pagan community how \\"cool\\" it is to be wiccan.With this book it wasn't like she was typing to a 5 year old which was better but, it still holds all the superficial glamour teachings and spells which I think is ignorant.All of these kids/teenagers are being lead on that magick and being a witch is a end to all your social problems.Well let me warn you, it's not.But I personally believe if you're going to study paganism or wicca read everything you can and take from it what you feel is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate? . . . Fluff!","review":"I bought this because it seemed to cover a lot of territory. In the end, that's its biggest fault--kind of a lick and a promise approach. Even worse is that this author seems to devote much of her efforts to feeding the usual teenaged angst, and giving youngsters the idea SHE is the only one who understands them. . . very dangerous territory, IMO. One thing to offer generic advice, and another to try to generate a cult following. Some useful stuff within, but even more to have to sift through with a grain of salt. If you're new to this topic, don't make the mistake of ending your search here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the blender please!","review":"If you're looking for a re-hashed conglomerate of all the books on the craft out there, then go ahead and buy this book. Here, Silver has successfully minced up her old works, thrown in some bogus information to taste, and hit the puree button on the proverbial blender.Personally, I wouldn't bother with the investment. I borrowed the book from a friend, and returned it disgusted, not wanting to buy it for myself. In this book, there are places where Silver begins to Christanize some of the Pagan ideas... in my opinion, she's just selling out her craft.If you're looking to get started in the craft, I would absoluely recommend some of her earlier books, like \\"To Ride a Silver Broomstick\\" and \\"To Stir a Magick Cauldron.\\" These books are excellent, and essential additions to the library of any serious Witch. This new book, however, is defiently one that my bookshelf will be happier without!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"I have tried to read the \\"whole\\" of the book, but find that the book has too many \\"holes\\".For those who are interested in the Wiccan path, read Scott Cunningham as a start as he, and there are others, who explain and teach with great wisdom.I am sorry I am not s fan of hers, but I find her books more for teenagers and certainly they should not be reading Silverwolf without having read a proper authority on Wicca. Sadly, hers are the books that remind me too much of Halloween and all the kiddy behavior that sometimes follows.Please, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Silver! Now We're Talkin'","review":"Hello everyone,If any of you ever want a great book (no matter of length) on Wicca this is the one for you. Yes its lengthy but you can do it.

But just this once, I wish there were a library for these sorts of books that I could've read through it before buying... It would've been nice if I had someone at the time to advice me against spending that $20...I am against any religious bashing, which Ravenwolf does a couple of times towards Christianity. Bashing is a pretty strong word, but still -- what right do any of us have to call another religion's believes \\"superstitions\\"?I wish so badly that this book, when it came to the spells and rituals, would be more of a guide instead of a step by step instruction manual.I also wish that there was SOMETHING about the Rede in there, something more about meditation, and karma...To make a long story short:I recycled it.And that says a lot.Find another book -- please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Find","review":"I don't normally like the work of Silver Ravenwolf, but this was a surprising find. The very completeness of the information within the book is rather impressive - I'm amazed at the extensive research and the layout which makes it easy to follow and easy to find just about anything you might want to know.This book makes it in my top 20 books for both neophytes and old hands - it's the first of her books to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"pagan in podunk","review":"I am a very big fan of silver ravenwolf, and there is no exception here. She was my starting off point in wicca, I did not end up there, but it was a starting point none the less. I like her approach as I have seen some call it the \\"mamma silver\\" because it is less intemidating for younger viewers who are just starting out, she is not \\"insulting the reader\\" she wrote this book for teens. If you don't like that, then don't read it. I am currently showing my younger sibling the different religous ways, and silver ravenwolf was one of the things I showed them. Part of our religion is to believe everyone has a right to their beliefs, how can you say she is wrong?"},{"rating":"2","title":"*MUST HAVE* For a Serious Witch's Library","review":"Well, I have to confess.... I am not a fan of Silver Ravenwolf. And am always skeptical any of her books will appeal to me... I don't know why I never got into her...I'm not one of those prima dona witches that think she's too \\"fluffy bunny\\"... just the subject matter never appealed to my particular path.So when I say that this is a GREAT book!! You can realize that it's coming from a skeptic of Ravenwolf!! Lots of pages in this book - 590pages!! Packed FULL of explanations, definitions, correspondences, etc... all neatly arranged so that they are easy to look up and easy to read! Consider this your Book of Shadows Encyclopedia!! Definitely IMO a *MUST HAVE* for the serious witch's library!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was She Guessing???","review":"Has she stopped researching for these books? I have never returned a book in my life but this one went back to the store. Being Asatru I immediately opened up to the section on runes. That was a joke, they were completely messed up. She changed the names, swapped meanings for the runes, and even included the blank one. Runes are not something that one can debate on, they are what they are. The section of teenie bopper spells was memorable. Of course that kind of throws the three fold rule out the window. Or drives the witch performing them into a pickle, I would not want that backlash. This book was a waste of perfectly good paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solitary Witch review","review":"Silver RavenWolf is a very popular member of the Wiccan world. She has written several books on the subject as well, including To Ride A Silver Broomstick, Teen Witch, Halloween, Silver's Spells for Love, and more. She approches her topic with a light hearted sense of humor and nearly a lifetime's worth of knowlegde.Solitary Witch is for anyone knew to the Craft, or anyone who would like to learn more, as well as secondary level craft users. It's divided into five parts to help break down all the information. At times, it can be overwhelming just how much there is to know, but Silver explains it in a way that makes it more simple and friendly to all readers.This book is recommended for slightly older readers, simply because of the amount of information within."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mixed bag","review":"Bottom line: some people might find it helpful. There are good resources here and solid information on lunar cycles, history, etc. But some parts of the book are flat-out wrong. She claims that the Hand of Glory wasn't \\"an actual hand\\"! Sorry, $ilver, but blood of bat and tongue of dog weren't just \\"herbal codes\\", they were quite real.The book is geared to teenagers, and while it isn't too condescending, a lot of people are going to find it unbelievably silly. If you can stand her horribly annoying diction and you're well-versed enough to know what is and isn't fact, buy it. Otherwise, see if you can scalp it to a neighborhood teenybopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is she still allowed to write books","review":"I don't understand why Silver RavenWolf is so popular. She is a horrible writer. You have to be an idiot to get anything out of it. That's all that really needs to be said. STOP WRITING SILVER!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"When i got this book i was very excited to read it and once i read i just loved it!! I couldnt stop reading! love the book its very helpful to me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler material for Wicaa wannabes.","review":"If you have no plans on taking Wicca seriously, read it by all means, but if you're exploring this as a legitimate religious option, stay away from her at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommened it!","review":"I think this is a great book, it may be a lot like the other three New Generation Books, but It's got all of it in one book. And of course it's going to sound the same, it's by the same author. I highly recommend it!And also, for those wiccans/pagans who keep writing bad reviews, not to scare anyone, but you sound a lot like a (gasp!) christian...if you know what I mean..."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you can only afford one wicca book, get this one","review":"I have bought tons of magick/wicca books in the last three years, but this one is still the best one i ever bought. Taught me most about wide range of subjects directly and indirectly used by various wicca/pagan/witchcraft groups, like moon phases, chakras, colors and various others magickal correcpondences. I like Silver's writing style too. She makes magick close and acceptable and not as macabre as some might want us to believe. Excellent book, thumbs up from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book","review":"This is a great reference book to have in your collection. Like all of Ravenwolf's book, it is easy to read and understand. It isn't complicated and doesn't require out of the ordinary props or materials. Very useful book to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recomended","review":"I would not use this book or any by this author. She has a Dogmatic approach which lends itself to be a one way view.It has some valid material but for someone who is serious about Witchcraft don't bother unless you like to be subject to her moral dogmatic beat down. Start with Scott Cunningham and avoid her material."},{"rating":"1","title":"book of shadows and sex?","review":"I was expecting much more after reading the hard copy of the same titles book lent to me by a friend. This book, however, isn't half as informative. It has a chapter about sex. Nothing magickal about it. Really informative about herbs and basic spells, but I wouldn't recommend this book to serious practicers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Info","review":"I found this book to be a very informative and comprehensive collection of both new practices and historical reference. It is written in language that is easy to understand and the explanation of practices includes solid rationale. Anyone who is interested in researching Witchcraft or Wicca should find this very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT book by RavenWolf","review":"I am a long-time reader of various Witchcraft books. I have read RavenWolf's previous books and enjoyed them though a lot of people refer to her a \\"fluffy.\\" Her new book \\"Solitary Witch\\" is an unbelieveable resource! It is one of the most impressive, researched books I have seen in a long time! HIGHLY reccomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And One More Time With feeling....","review":"How many times can the same thing be said in a different way? Well, apparently at least one more time. I have to admit that this book is not as sappy as the author's usual work. And although Silver's writings appear to still be targeting the Teen Market, this book is not as \\"dumbed down\\" as we've seen from her in the past. Still, I have to cringe at some of the topics covered in this book (like spells for acne).All that aside, this book seems better thought out than Silver's past books. And there is a small trace of an attempt to bring balance to this work regarding historical perspectives. For a teen's book, this one is not as bad as others we've seen. But, \\"not so bad\\" isn't really what we should accept or encourage from writers in our community. But that's just my opinon, I could be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Info - Aimed at Kids","review":"I have very mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, its got a TON of information and is a wonderful reference book. However, its written specifically for teenagers. If it wasn't aimed towards teens, it would be THE BEST book on the market and the CLOSEST THING TO AN ALL-IN-ONE WICCA BOOK that exists.Personally, the kiddy theme is too distracting for me to use regularly (but its still a great reference book). If you are considering buying this, look through it at a bookstore to see if its right for you. Barnes n Noble carries it, and they will order it if they are out of stock and you ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"So I bought this book because I love Silver's other books. Wow! It is huge and full of information. In fact, it's one of those only book on wicca that you need. I agree that it is geared toward the already practicing wiccan but there is so much info that it is accessible to anyone who practices. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is already millionaire....","review":"you don't have to give $ilver more money, if your searching a spritual aproach you must read Marian Green's - A Witch Alone , if you're searching a new modern positive attitude read lasara Firefox's Sexy witch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I purchased this book with the idea that it could be a good reference guide for a student I have been working with. I would have returned the book if I could have. Although it is focused toward the wandering teen, it's ideas are too scarce. The ideas within are not necessarily focused to any one religion, but a mix of all the different aspects that the author has put together as wicca. This is a choice that is made by the practicioner, and nowhere in this book does it stress this opinion.For those who would like some fun reading about what fantasy religion could be, this would be the book for you. For those who really need some insight into pagan or wiccan religion/spirituality should look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A resource above all others.","review":"If you have a question about Wicca, this book has the answer. It is a big fat textbook sized book. There is a Table of Contents at the front and an index in the back. Everything is sorted through by topic. It is easy to find what you need to know about with in the book. It has some sections geared towards teens but in general it is an all ages book that everyone should have on their bookshelf. If I could only have one book, this would be my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solitary Witch","review":"This book is very complete and a must have for any modern witches' library.

The picture on the board itself is a colorful and fun graphic. However, the quality of the product is very poor. The game pieces are on such thin paper and so tiny it is difficult to pick them up. It is VERY over priced for the quality of the product. Should be more like $5. Peaceable Kingdoms game, Stone Soup, is $10 instead of $15 and the quality is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game for families with young kids","review":"This game basically combines the games Memory (where you turn over tiles to make matches) with Clue. The production value is low, but the game play is good and the artwork and theme are fun. Makes me want to try other games by Family Pastimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"We've had the game for almost a year and we've only played it when it arrived. Frankly, my 5 year old daughter and I didn't find it as much fun or as stimulating as expected based on the positive reviews. Main complaint is that the pieces are INCREDIBLY flimsy (has a home made feel) and one has to manage that aspect instead of fully focusing on the important things. My secondary complaint is that the game is barely more involved than the basic memory card games that cost much less and no where near as challenging as Zoombinis software, which we love. So, this game is not much fun, not well made, not very stimulating, yet it carries a relatively high price - avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Secret is.... THIS GAME STINKS!","review":"Bought this for my five yo who plays it in his class.The overall compostion of the game is so cheap. It is like it was made on a copy machine. The cards are paper thin, and will not last over time. After setting up the game, many of the cards were already bent.Next thing is that the directions are somewhat complicated. Maybe I'm impatient, but I just did not get it.There are so many other games that are truly educational and that are well made. I'm just not sure that this is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality without supporting service","review":"I totally agree with the other reviewers: the quality is very poor. damage the card in the beginning. very easy to lose small cards. very cheap made. does not worth $12. The idea is fun. But there are other better games at this price(I mean quality). BTW, there is no way to contact the seller or manufacturer. No phone number, no response. Do not buy this. Buy something made in U.S. At least you can talk to someone when there is a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"we're enjoying cooperative games","review":"I purchased this game and Max. We've enjoyed both cooperative games, and would recommend them especially if you play a lot of games and get tired of the competition. The Max game is definitely more popular in our house - maybe because it's hard to win playing the secret door?!? It is fun, but not quite popular enough with my kids for me to give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing quality","review":"While this game is fun to play, and my children enjoy the secret door aspect of the game, the quality of the product is really, really poor. The board itself arrived warped and buckled with the house glued on it crookedly. At least half the playing pieces tore as we took them apart. Definitely not built to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick game for students!","review":"I'm a school psychologist and have this game in my office-it's a great cooperative game. Students use memory skills and work together. It's one of their favorites. Especially third graders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret Door","review":"This is a terrific version of the old-fashioned memory game with the bonus of being a co-operative game in which the players work together to find matches before time runs out. My children and I return to this game again and again! Makes a great gift game since everyone can enjoy the play! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading for Educators","review":"Goodbye, Mr. Chips, Goodbye...This selection is a favorite especially for teachers.

The writing is classic, and the characterization very easy to follow. But the payoff was lacking -- it seemed to me that the book was more interested in making a point (which I think was Tolstoy's object anyway) than actually having a book that provides a true novel experience. I suppose my review expresses my disappointment, as Tolstoy is one of my all-time favorite writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Sample","review":"I downloaded sample to compare the translation of this edition, but the entire thing was the introduction.

This has never happened before and so it might give some indication that the film is, in it's own way, a charming motion picture. Quite refreshing.

I rated it 3 1/2 stars; therefore moved it up to 4 rather than down to 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"Don't waste your money! The original book was far better than this version.

As a young kid growing up in a highly disfunctional family I read a book with the same title. This was my favorite book through my entire youth as well as highschool. It was my escape.The movie is loosely based on the book in the charactors and the plot. However the book was so much deeper in the respect of how JJ learns to live in the park. As soon as the Kathleen Turner charactor is shown you know exactly where this thing is going. JJ never seems to be more than a few days at summer camp sleeping in a really cool cave.He never gets sick from eating out of garbage cans. He never breaks into Taven on the Green for food. He never build a tree house using ropes because he can't hurt the tree.This book is out of print but if you can find a copy or get it at your library READ IT! You will remeber it forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prince of Centeral Park","review":"Many years ago, I saw was fortunate to see off Broadway show \\"Prince of Central Park\\" Reason I say fortunate, is because UNFORTUNATELY this was in and out. Everyone I was every telling about this show has never heard of it. I have to say that that was THE most impressive shows I have ever seen. Many years later I came across this movie and was excited because I could finally share it with my husband who I was telling so much about the show. Unfortunately the movie was not done as powerfully as the show was. Even thought the subject is very moving. I wish this Broadway Show would be back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and Tender Ladies","review":"Lee Smith takes us on a historical fictional tour of rural south in the late 19th to mid 20th century through the life if Ivy Rowe. Ivy's life experiences are chronicled in letters to living and dead family and friends.Intelligent and independent Ivy's early life is a large family on a mountain top. The family leaves the mountain for a small town after her Father passes and farming on the mountain is no longer sustainable.Town life introduces the reader to a rich parade of characters that directly touch Ivy and her siblings. Ivy's complex nature and curiosity drives her to experience life on the edge, no matter the consequences.Lee Smith beautifully chronicles the life of a Steel Magnolia through Ivy Rowe and we are the better for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"This is a life story of a girl/lady that grew up in a very rural setting and her encounters with life, including her dreams for herself and her family. I liked the way the main character used letters to others to tell the story of her life. Her story showed me the ebb and flow of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the style, but the content....not so much","review":"To read the plot summary off the cover, you would have thought that this was a lovely poignant classic, along the lines of \\"Little House\\" or something. Just sounded so sweet. It wasn't. I got tired of the over the top, bizarre sexual scenarios, they were perverted and so unnecessary to the otherwise compelling story. It seemed so forced as if the author thought it vital to the selling of the book to throw in various gratuitous sex scenes. Nothing like the style of story you would think you were getting from the paragraph descriptions above on this book. I got half way through the book and gave up....wasted time. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"This is just an excellent novel by a fine writer. In all honesty I'm sort of at a loss here so I'll just say that you should read this book. You'll thank all of us who have recommended it to you.Oh, I heard Lee Smith interviewed and she's really worth hearing. She's funny, self-effacing and smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I not discover Lee Smith a long time ago?","review":"Deft storytelling, timeless truths about women's lives, and an authentic voice that I can vouch for, having spent time with family in that part of the world. Ivy's story helps me to finally understand a lot about my own late mother, who grew up there and would have been only a few years younger than her. Like Smith, when I went to college and read Faulkner, I wondered what South he was talking about, since what I knew was Appalachian Virginia. Finally, this wonderful writer has captured the essence of that other, fascinating \\"secret\\" South, which has little to do with the Civil War and is more than just Hatfields and McCoys. I cannot heap enough praise on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and Tender Ladies","review":"I would give Fair and Tender Ladies by Lee Smith 100 stars!! Oh my word! I love this book!!

Definitely not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!! I feel So much better!!!!!","review":"This Tai Chi DVD is wonderful. I have only done the introductory part and it has helped my balance and legs already. I also bought Mr. Rones Sunset Tai Chi to do before I go to bed and that has helped relieve tension in my sholder and neck muscles.The exercises in the beginning take over an hour to do but are done slowly enough so a novice can see how to do them. Some of are basic stretch exercises others zero in on specific muscle groups and all of them make me feel better. In spite of being introductory, I can only do them every other day. But my disposition is improving -- I am happier and have more energy and this after only a couple of weeks. It helps my arthritis too. I am more flexible.I still havn't tried or looked at the rest of the dvd where actual T'ai Chi exercises are put together in a seamless flowing field of energy and movement. However, for the part I am working on, I do want to say, Thank you, Mr. Rones!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"This CD would probably be okay for someone already familiar with Tai Chi, but it was useless to a beginner.

Look elsewhere if you want to do tai chi","review":"I don't normally review products. But my disappointment in this product prompts me to do so.1. The DVD is hard to navigate. To find actual instruction for Tai chi moves - one has to hunt through too many different levels in the menu.2. The instruction for the tai chi moves once you find them is minimal.3. The DVD does not teach you anywhere near all 24 moves of tai-chi4. The DVD is more a easy/going touchy feely way to wake up - more stretch and breath than anything.5. It's very very repetitive.6. While the outdoors scenes are pretty, the director rarely moves the camera in an effort to guide you towards further education.I will be sending the DVD back. I suggest you look elsewhere as I will for guidance in tai-chi.The search continues."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree - Amazing DVD - Amazing animation","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this is an amazing DVD, and want to mention that it has incredible animations of the Qi energy in the body, as well as easy to understand diagrams of the the brain, glands, and internal organs while the instructor explains how these internal exercises work.Also, many of the exercises are taught in three stages, beginner, intermediate, and advanced, and each stretch is held for three minutes, so I doubt many of us will work our way up to the advanced version of the three minute exercise very quickly.Its a DVD that you can really grow with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five DVD purchases but this is the best","review":"I have kept myself in good shape over the years stationary biking, rowing machine,swimming, and occassional weight training. Years ago I earned a brown belt in Kenpo style Karate. Having been diagnosed with diabetes several years ago, I decided to recently add martial arts to my exercise routines. Since I can no longer spar or even go barefoot because of foot nueropathy, I decided on tai chi. There is no shortage of tai chi DVD's but finding good ones is more difficult.

There is tons of step-by-step instruction, and every move is explained in detail, providing everything you need to practice Tai Chi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Complete","review":"I bought this dvd for my husband for Christmas. He was thrilled, as we have talked about taking a class for a long time and we were house-bound with a storm.

The DVDs arrived, according to both USPS and DeeVeeDees, but someone must have nicked the package as I never received it. After months of trying to find out who at USPS delivered the package in order to figure out how or why it disappeared, I gave up. I notified DeeVeeDees and they prompty sent out another one.

However, I was very disappointed at the change in his subject matter. It appears he prostituted himself for the \\"Rules\\" CD.At Carnegie Hall, for a large Democrat and liberal audience, he only disparages conservatives and Republicans. Hurricane Katrina--he has nothing to say about the Democrat mayor of New Orleans nor the Democrat governor of Louisiana.Gay Marriage--everyone who is Republican is homophobe, not homoaverse.Terry Schiavo-only the Republicans used her for political advantage, while Black relates how he masturbated through this event.However, in \\"Rules,\\" before a conservative audience, he disparages both sides of the political spectrum, dishonestly protraying himself as a moderate.I really don't care if you are left-wing or right-wing, but if you are going to do political humor, at least you should always be honest about what side of the fence, or on the fence, you are standing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackout laughing","review":"Lewis Black is one of, if not the best contemporary comedian.

These letters are very interesting in that they tell about everyday life in the 16th century.

Although some 87 letters between Magdalena and Balthazar are exant, the editor includes fewer than 20 in their entirety. Also, the entire volume is fewer than 200 pages so the book could have been longer.

I enjoy the interaction of the characters, their wit, and the way many things are left unsaid, leaving the watcher to wonder. I read Ground Zero to see if those qualities could transfer to the written media. Unfortunately, I found that the book's portrayal of those qualities was limited at best. I suppose, in the end, only David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson can bring the characters of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully to life.In Ground Zero Agents Mulder and Scully are assigned the case of the mysterious murder of a nuclear physicist. The book isn't horribly written, although it is very simple. I would only recommend this novel to die-hard \\"X-Files\\" fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I was/am a big fan of X-files and I really enjoyed this book.

Mulder and Scully find black ash and think that has something to do with his death. They try to find a link to his death and other deaths that have this same black ash in the scene. Read this book to get it all. A very good book :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic X-Files, but with a modern tint to it","review":"This is highly enjoyable.

The way Anderson decribes their frustration is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!.............until the end.","review":"It was a good book. It was great until the end. I thought the end was stupid. With all the government coverups in it, it makes a conspiracy lover go crazy, until the end.

It wasn't the same old boring plot where the reader has a clear understanding of the situation and actually knows what the ending is. As a reader, I felt like I was joining Mulder and Scully and I was unraveling a bizarre mystery with them, not as an onlooker. However, I have to say that I would've liked to know more about the victims. In so many episodes on TV, Mulder and Scully's emotions are seen because they are human beings and they are faced with a death (or many) every case. In this book, I saw more emotion from the less emotional Scully than I saw Mulder. Yes, Scully has had her ups and downs, like with her cancer, but the entire series centers specifically on Mulder's problems and his search for the truth. I didn't see that, and I was disappointed because of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea- weak execution","review":"Now having read 7 books either written or co-written by Kevin J. Anderson,(3 Star Wars, 3 X-Files and 1 Dune) I can say that the man has good ideas, I just don't think that his writing is all that absorbing. As with his Star Wars books, his X-Files books never quite ring true of the characters. As for the cases, they are pretty good, but it isn't Mulder and Scully who are chasing down the monsters. Of all the new X-Files books, Charles Grant's \\"Whirlwind\\" nails the characters of Mulder and Scully, but the case isn't particularly involving."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best.","review":"I have read this book many many times and I still get scared.

As far as Anderson's writing, I liked Goblins and Ruins as well, but I'd have to say that this one was my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"peter davison- simply the BEST!","review":"Yes, it was very difficult for Peter to replace Tom Baker's place and some of of Baker\`s fans will not give Davison credit at all, and that is so sad. If you have seen good old Peter in All creatures great and small, you'll definitely like him as the Doctor! Tegan ( Janet Fielding) is brilliant as always, Adric shows his loyalty to the Doctor, and Nyssa is a bit annoying, but her falling in the water is amusing :)Anthony Ainley stars as the Master and performs wonderful! Great storyline and just wonderful; Peter is just marvelous as the Doctor"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Start For Peter Davison's Doctor","review":"Most Whovians regard this as one of the finest episodes in the entire canon of Doctor Who; it is certainly among the best of the Peter Davison era. Although the acting from The Doctor's companions is not quite up to the usual high standards, it is certainly redeemed by Anthony Ainley's splendid performance as The Master, The Doctor's Gallifreyan nemesis. The most riveting scenes are in Part I, as the Tardis hurls back in time towards the Big Bang, but I was quite intrigued as well with the interactions between the inhabitants of Castrovalva and The Doctor and his companions. Admittedly Peter Davison comes across as a stylish wimp in stark contrast to Tom Baker, but I believe this owes more to John Nathan Turner's stewardship of Doctor Who, than incompetent acting from Davison."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film was very good and should be enjoyed by all!","review":"I have to say that even though this Doctor is not my very favourite one, I certainly was intrigued by this episode and this Doctor(the best Doctor of course being Sylvester McCoy!!!). The storyline rather grabbed me and kept me interested and all the while I was wondering just exactly what the outcome might be. As I watched the two shows previous in the series I was caught unawares when scarf? Dotor was terminated, as it were. I also enjoy the charactors involved with this Doctor, Adrik, the girls...etc. I am a huge fan of the Doctor series though not extremely well versed in all of them quite yet. All in all very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We're caught in a space-time trap!","review":"Considering what has happened in the previous story, Castrovalva stands up on it's own very well. Like a previous reviewer noted, Castrovalva works because of it's charm. All the actors are on good form with some good interaction between the companions. Adric is left out for most of the story, and some people would say that is not a bad thing. The first and start of the second episode are somewhat hectic, with a lot going on. Overall, it's a very good story - but make you sure watch Logopolis first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mike Wallace 1996 documentary on alcohol","review":"this mid 90's production is narrarated by Mike Wallace (60 Minutes) as he observes alcohol use in the United States during the 20th century.covered in this documentary is the era before, during, and after the Prohibition era, which took place during the 1920's; then later the repeal of Prohibition.also covered is the origin of AA, or Alcoholics Anonymous, which was formed in June of 1935.

I think that there is some useful information in this book. There are simple phrases that have really changed my outlook on life.Things like \\"Self Importance\\" really made me worry less about my problems and enjoy the world instead.Labeling things and categoring things can really take the meaning out of things. For example, Carlos tries to find out about Don Juans ancestry. Don Juan refuses to have his ancestry to tell him how to live or to label him, therefore he doesn't think it's important.I like the part where Carlos was whining about his father not getting up in time to go swimming. He whining went nowhere, Don Juan said that \\"maybe he had trouble getting up\\". \\"If you were so strong why didn't you go swimming yourself.\\"I learned that promises you make to other people are equally important no matter how big or little it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"a bit slow at the beginning, but an amazing book nevertheless, full of wisdom would totally recommend it to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Another account of the diemention of the dead, quite good.

I would recommend this book to anyone who needs a good campfire starter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"Don Juan attempts to teach Carlos Castaneda vague lessons by engaging him in a series of nonsensical activities. Many of the themes are common to other spiritual traditions (e.g. breaking routines, becoming inaccessible, not doing, or stopping the world--in the language of this book) and because of this, the reader may have a clue as to what Don Juan is getting at. However, Don Juan consistently spurns Castaneda when he asks for explanations, insisting on showing him instead. Unfortunately, the demonstrations seem to be pointless and nonsensical. Maybe, that's the point, but it gets tiresome to endure this over and over again throughout the book. I'm a big fan of psychedelic drugs and solipsistic thinking, and I approached this book with a great amount of focus but finished it mostly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to sell garbage to hippies","review":"Castaneda's books are garbage designed to make money from gullible hippies, and there are plenty of them still around.

That doesn't say a lot but hey I never like the bible. For some its almost petty to the number of polished novels and books already on the market and waiting for you pocket book. I must say though, this is quite the exquisite example of whats possible in our world or reality to get metaphyiscal. Many of the writes or teachings of castaneda are just that but this book to some is a starting point from which to begin the journey.

It keeps you laughing from the begining to the end, with a story line that combines many adventure tales, and twists 'em into hilarity. It is set in the time of Robin Hood, includes parts that could be from Zorro (In the movie, a Robin Hood character is called 'the fox') and has quips such as \\" The PURPLE Pimpernel\\" which resides on the rear end of the baby king. A must for every video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Danny Kaye!","review":"I've wanted to introduce my kids to classic movies and I decided to start with comedies.

They got a kick out of it when they recognized Angela Lansbury and Glynnis Johns, and it's a really cute movie.My only problem with it is that it only has the widescreen format. I made a promise to myself not to waste any money on movies that weren't available in full-screen format, but this movie is worth making an exception to that rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite movies.","review":"This is an absolutely hilarous movie, from beginning to end. Aside from being a dead-on parody of the Robin Hood movies, it's packed with classic comedy and song bits. Basil Rathbone is the perfect evil villian, and Kaye is perfect as a bumbling peasant pressed into service to overthrow the villainous King.

The \\"pellet with the poison\\" scene is truly hilarious, and it goes on for about 10 minutes. I can't think of another picture with a scene that will make you laugh that long. Also, the image of the baby pig coming through the gate instead of the wild boar in the nighthood test makes me laugh each time I think of it.

They not only taste delicious, but the recipe is soooo easy. This lady really knows how to cook southern style.If you like cajun, this is the book to buy. The jambalaya is very easy and feeds a crowd in a hurry.

What happened?","review":"Spock's Beard is a great band ,talented musicians and great music but something went wrong here,,a terrible experiment or something but man what a disappointment! Overall poor songs,no powerful tunes,no punch,no great lyrics,just downright bad. Hate to say it but the guys messed up on this one!dont waste your money on this one! Very poor effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Prog CD","review":"I have yet to be disappointed in anything done by Spocks Beard. Their songs are beautifully constructed and the musicianmanship/vocals are superb. You can't help but listen to this group and hear a uniquely American expression of the genius of Gentle Giant. Spocks Beard successfully blends elements of rock, fusion and classical sensibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music...a lot of fun to listen to","review":"This is my first Spock's Beard CD. Let's just say that they blew me away. I have been a long time fan of groups like Kansas, Yes, Rush, etc. I was getting discouraged that I couldn't find a good new progressive band to listen to. Well, I just found them. This CD has great musicianship and is just a blast to listen to. I plan on getting there other CDs based on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not To My Liking","review":"Another highly-praised album that I cannot find myself enjoying. Too many different sounds and influences on this album. Very confusing and jumbled musical ideas. One song is pure pop, another is pure 70's style prog, another sounds alternative, and then switches to a long instrumental break that sounds like jazz. Too weird for my ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rarely Missed Target","review":"I won't rehash information found in other reviews of this album. I've recently bought a number of Spock's Beard albums and am shocked at not only their sheer talent, but their ability to convey it in such pleasurable ways. It's all a question of style, and Spock's Beard has it...but just not on this CD. This one is a departure from their normal format, the songs being much shorter and the overall demeanor much 'harder'. The hardness comes from guitar distortions liberally distributed in too many tracks, and although I can normally deal with hard (prog) rock just fine, I find this release too obnoxious on balance. Unless you are distortion freak, stick with many of the other SB albums, many of them are top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otra maravilla más","review":"Spocks beard es un gran grupo de rock progresivo, aunque algunos, por ahí lo cataloguen de pop; tiene un estilo muy propio que se ha establecido con el tiempo. Cabe destacar la gran técnica de este grupo a la hora de utilizar los contratiempos, cosa que no hacen en el pop, sino en el exquisito rock que nos muestra SB.Este album en particular es, a mi juicio otra de las obras maestras de SB, después de Kidness of Stragers, me vuelven a sorprnder con la magnifica voz de Neal Morse, poniendo fuerza y armonía a cada uno de los temas de Day For Night.Realmente lo aconsejo y le doy mis 5 estrellas, se lo merecen los SB, pasando por su mejor tiempo musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band!","review":"This is a great CD. I haven't heard progressive rock like this in many years. One thing I really like about the CD is that even though the band members are obviously very talented musicians, they never lose sight of writing good songs and melodies - not self-indulgent. I was very pleasantly surprised, and will have to check out the rest of their CDs now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept is interesting but, doesn't amount to much...","review":"It seems that Korine has just decided to make his script as controversial as possible so that it would at least allow him some publicity for a film that probably would have otherwise sunk without trace. Being a small independent movie, it suffers the effects of such a budget; bad sound, camerawork and even actors (apart from Sevigny). Unlike many other films that are similar in content and subject matter, Clark's direction doesn't raise it above standards. Boys Don't Cry is a classic example of an 'indie' film that has risen above prejudices concerning independent films due to Peirce's sharp direction and haunting photography."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Nik","review":"This movie got all its attention simply because of the shocking way these kids act. Although I did not grow up in a big city I knew kids like the ones portrayed and found them just as much a waste of life then as the kids in the movie now.Some of the acting wasn't bad, in particular the actress portraying Jenny, the girl who discovers she has aids after only only having sex with one boy. However, I was just plan bored and to me, thats the worst sin a movie can commit; boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit close to reality....but come on!! hold your breaks","review":"The story somehow is quite interesting, and it does highlights several issues that people should be aware of, but for god's sake, it's exceeds the reality, i know there are kids like that and even more, i was one of them once, but the way it was let go was quite exadurated, specialy the last 15 minutes or so.Anyway worth watching, i'm giving it three stars simply for the idea and the awarness it could cause (somehow), however the quality of picture (dvd) is not that good (2 out of five) sound is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Why would they direct a movie about N.Y.C. street kids doing bad stuff? This movie just talks about kids who are wild as crazy. If you want to see a better movie that's kind of like this go rent Hurricane Streets that movie was alot better than this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate wiggers","review":"The sex, drugs, violence and constant marijuana usage didn't get to me.

I'm so glad that I checked the NO box on the sex education form at my daughter's school and she was spared this movie. Maybe kids do go through this in a day, but I sure hope not. I would hope they wouldn't go through half that much in a lifetime. I'm realistic, I know that it's hard out there for teens-peer pressure, violence, rape and drugs and homosexuality abound. But this movie gave no hope or understanding, or strong underlining moral to grab hold of. The attempt at realism was overdone. The movie was a major downer with no punch at the end...so they all had sex and died, the end. Sheesh, I've seen better points made for not having sex with a condom. If they wanted to prove a point they should have shown the kid dying from the disease...instead of how they got it. We all know how they got it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT recommended","review":"An aimless, depressing and unrelentingly dismal movie about the mindless and emotionless lives of a group of kids. The film lacks any redeeming virtues.

To prove that there are really stupid teens living in the city with nothing more to do than talk about \\"gettin' some\\" all day?The acting in this film is pretty good but that is where my praise stops. I found this film to be a repulsive steaming pile with no redeeming value.If I was Chloe Sevigny, or anyone else involved in the making of this film, I would be embarassed to have my name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids DVD","review":"I hate this DVD simply because it didn't work in any type of DVD player I tried to play it in. So could you please send me another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"This movie is boring, there is no script to it. It's like the makers went out on the streets, and asked a bunch of kids to act like idiots while he tapes them."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie stinks","review":"I would personally picket stores to stop carrying this movie. It is horrible in every sense of the word."},{"rating":"2","title":"As real as it gets","review":"Ignore the reviewer who called this \\"unrealistic\\", she's obviously led a sheltered life and the fact that she suggests all teen conflict come from racial tension leads me to conclude that we at least know someone isn't color blind. In closing, see the film for yourself. It is about street kids in NY written by one who lived the life in NY and does not apply to all parts of the country. Take it for what it is...REAL."},{"rating":"2","title":"fiction or reality?","review":"After reading the reviews of many on kids,... I dont find anything in the movie to be a surprise. Raves, extacy, sex, drugs and drinking stretch further than the \\"non-parent\\" city youths shown in the movie. Its everywhere. Anyone who thinks this movie is \\"shocking\\" or not right in any way needs to get out of thier bubble and look around. Kids smoke weed, drink, do drugs, smoke blunts, eat extacy and have sex. Its just taboo in some areas. But, to most teenagers thats just reality."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you don' see the brilliance in this film, you're crazy","review":"As I said above, if you don't see the brilliance of this film, you're crazy. This film is NOT at all influencing teens to act the way the teens in the movie did. This movie is a wake up call to parents. The last line in the movie is a teen saying \\"What the hell happened?\\" Think about that as you watch this movie, I guarantee that you'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the disc, not the film","review":"First off, this version is cut. I might be wrong with the numbers, but this DVD is 91 minutes long, while the complete film is 102 minutes long. So, there. Also, it's non-anamorphic, and has no extras. This is the second DVD release of \\"Kids,\\" but so far the company has failed to release a great film in any kind of a deserving package.Here's hoping for a Special Edition, with a commentary, anamorphic transfer, and everything else.

I was surprised that the VHS format was at EP (slow) speed (thus reducing the video quality) and the cellophane wraping seemed flimsy. I bought the copy from Amazon. Maybe I should have expected this because it was so inexpensive.I did not notice any defects in the actual video, however.Bill"},{"rating":"2","title":"KIDS","review":"I first heard about the movie \\"KIDS\\" from the Logo Channel in kck and wanted to see it so i could see just how others viewed teens and the ever so frightening subject of teen sexuality and the scare of contracting some sexually transmitted diseases. It was very interesting to see how they actually picked up on how the young kids of today really act in big cities, and most likely in small towns also. Makes one want to be able to keep a watchful eye on their children alot more. I thought it was a good movie and very informative to parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFF THE MEAT RACK","review":"SEX.

There is only one problem with this movie and that is the audience by which it should be watched. Its hard to recommened this for 14-16 year olds because of its graphic nature and older audiences may find its message irrelevant due to having outgrown that stage in their life. For younger viewers, see it with an older friend, sibling or at the very least your parents. Its not something to add to your family DVD collection but defintely something to experience once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars for the emotions it provoked","review":"Parents watch this movie when your children are not around!! It will change your perspective on a lot of different issues. I would NOT recommend it to young people. It is a mature film with good acting and realistic notions. Anyone who thinks AIDS is not a reality or that morals are not important needs to check this out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a very good movie","review":"I first heard about this movie from a friend of mine and tryed finding it for a long time. When I finally found it and watched it, it really peaked my intrist with being a skateboarder and all. I found this movie to be very true because I have been through some of the same situations: the drugs, the sex, the fights, etc. It also made me feel luckey at the same time. I reccomend this movie to anyone who has been through some of these things or pretty much to everyone in general. Good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't listen to those people!","review":"look were the other reviewers are coming from they don't know what inner city life is like if you want to know, watch the film it's true stories of big city life."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET REAL !","review":"A great movie ??

I agree that the subject is interesting and that the movie itself, the screenplay, is good. But the actors cant play. We dont understand what they \\"say\\", or more exactly grumble.

But just because it is a reality does not mean that I have to like the movie, and I definitely do not. My friends and I did some crazy, stupid things in high school, but we did not behave this way. My goal as a parent is to raise my son in a caring, loving, yet disciplining environment where he can make his own decisions but understand the consequences of his own actions. Hopefully (without sounding naive) I can give my son the tools to make good decisions so he does not find himself in these same situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for teens","review":"This movie is on my top 15 list for sure.

This being for many reasons- every actor is a variable unknown but many launched their careers from this movie (Rosairo Dawson, Chole Savigeny. Is this movie sad? Yes. Is it depressing? No. Don't look at it as underage children having sex and doing drugs. Look at it and realize it showed the reality of America's youth when no one was ready to see it...Watch it again and again, it only gets better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it so hardcore","review":"Kids is a film that has been misunderstood since its release parents say that it is a kiddy porn film and that it makes no sense or that it does not have a proper ending. Children and teenagers however watch it and think that it is great because every one smokes drinks and has underage sex basically three things that are garuanteed to evoke a positive response from the underage amongst us. The thing about this film however is that it is basically a documentary commenting on the lives of a group of fairly average teenagers because lets face it most kids probably do get up to this kind of thing. If you watch Kids with an open mind you will see a harsh unrelenting look at the truth of the teenage social heierarchy of drink drugs and sex. On the whole a very thrilling film that pulls no punches and gives the topic of aids a new spin that is light years away from tom Hanks in Philadelphia."},{"rating":"2","title":"best movie i've seen.need more like it!!","review":"I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!

Hardly shocking and hardly worth watching again, \\"Kids\\" falls short of my expections."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT TRUE","review":"This movie shows an inaccurate portral of teenagers. Not many teenages act like the kids do in this movie. At least not were i live. This movie makes all teenagers look bad!!! A very small portion of teenages are actually like this.

If so, you care about your children 100x more than the parents of the characters in this movie ever would...so dont be worried. See what I'm saying?

Sex, violence, apathy - these are kids who have no idea of anything that doesn't affect them. Fine movie that really gets under the skin of these bored kids. Bare bones DVD, but that doesn't really matter with a movie this worth watching. Does have some very harsh language and some sexual situations that make you squirm, but never played for voyuerism. I recommend watching with the subtitles, as the slang and slurring can be a little hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps one of the most depressing films you'll ever see...","review":"Ive always said that I have yet to see a horror film as scary as real life. This film shows a documentary, brutal and hard look at real life for teens. This horrific look at life film deals with drug abuse, sex, aids and some violent aspects such as a scene where a gang of lads beat up a skateboarder in Central Park. All the characters are unlikable and the movie makes you feel empty and sad, as this stuff really happens in life. In particular theres a scene where a group of boys on a couch are all sharing a joint of weed and the boys only look about 12. Be cautious when watching this film is you are easily shocked or offended. As a teen I found it sick and unjustifying.

What makes this movie so great is that it tells it like it is. All those fake shows you see on t.v. like Dawson's Creek and Touched by an Angel are bull-.

The last thing that fitzpatrick says that when your kid there is not much to do and when you find something that you like you shoot for it, which it was that he did which leaves him with such a bleak existence.

I grew up with kids who used drugs and sex for recreation, and I imagined that things had gotten worse since I left my teens.Then I listened to the comments of teens who have lived in crackhouses, who have been shot at, who were raised by folks who traded their bodies for drugs or cash - and THEY'RE saying this movie is unrealistic.Telly, with his multitude of willing virgins, is more a dark fantasy of a teenage player than a real teen - rather like \\"Reefer Madness,\\" which had more to do with middle-class America's fear of marijuana than actual drug use.

I was laughing at the comparisons of the boys and girls talking. I was shocked at the callousness and indulgency of the rape scene. It still leaves me with anger. What this showed was the lack of respect for women and also every woman's fear of being raped while in such a vunerable space.

Fitzpatrick is barely literate, meaning he has no education whatsoever, so why put a loser who swears into a movie? I saw only 10 minutes of this film, and those 10 minutes made my rough life more miserable. This movie brought my fears to me. Not recommended for the average American."},{"rating":"2","title":"True story","review":"Its kind of hard to base your opinion on this movie because its real life, there are a whole lot of kids in the world exactly like this, so if you like to see the life of kids in the real world i would watch this movie.

Here we see young people who haven't yet had the chance to taste life and experiences like marriage and motherhood spread the deadly virus . Yet like Bully , in Kids as well i get the feeling than Larry Clark lost the control of his material . What is meant to be bold and challenging seems actually excessive to the average viewer . The parents in this movie are totally alieneted in their own dreamy world. Chloe Sevigny gives a promising first perfomance while Pierce and Fitzpatrick are also convicing yet \\" Kids \\" , for all it's brutal truths doesn't touch the viewer as much as it should have ."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIDS will keep us together","review":"On one level this movie was extremely realistic;an almost docu-drama of Brooklyn life and death.And as a piece of film-making very good and very believable. But on an old-fashioned level where characters draw our sympathies through their daily conflicts this was horrible. There were no redeeming qualities at all especially the guys.I felt on one level we were almost better off to have these kids eventually get AIDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obscene Filth","review":"This movie was a total waste of time. It's no wonder people have such bad attitudes towards teenagers, with myths such as this one prevailing. I can't believe any teacher or parent would want a young person to watch it. In fact, the school that showed that movie to its students should be shut down. It only gives people bad ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck for Dreck's Sake","review":"You have to have an affinity for what is most loathsome in human nature to appreciate the unrelenting vileness and a-morality celebrated in this movie. Okay, whether it is actually celebrated is, of course, arguable. However, this movie does nothing more than show us sordidness after sordidness: Teenage Telly practicing his favorite pasttime (next to getting high, perhaps)--painfully deflowering very young virgins; Telly kicking some poor slob nearly to death. Sex, drugs, sex, drugs, ad tedium.This movie might show us what *some* kids indulge in, but it really shows us nothing new, leads us to no new understanding of, well, anything under the sun except perhaps our own stoicism should we heroically make it through the entire movie.In a word: Blech!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is incredibly real and disturbing.","review":"No one is trying to pull the wool over your eyes with Kids. It is as real as a movie gets, focusing on the frightening world that big city teens live in today."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was stupid","review":"I can't imagine why anyone would praise this film. Okay maybe it is a reality check for our society, but so what?? It's a horribly acted, horribly scripted, uncreative, unoriginal and VERY exploitive film. The mere fact that it accurately depicts the lowest form of young degenerates in American society doesn't by itself make this a good film. Any idiot can film a bunch of teens having sex, getting intoxicated, beating up and raping people. But the film doesn't go beyond these depictions. it doesn't offer any solutions or explore the root causes of such behavior. And how many times do we need to be shown teens having sex or being raped to get the message? One time was shocking enough to be educational. Three or four times turns it into simple exploitation. This is little more than glorified child pornography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie doesn't deal with the issues","review":"While this movie brings to light some important social issues, it never goes deep enough and certainly offers no solutions. KIDS wants to shock us by showing underage sex and drug use, yet does little more. Where is the writer going with this? Does he simply want us to be a voyeur to the troubled teens in this film? I first saw this movie when I was 15 and I thought it was completely over-hyped and your average teenager is not acting the way those in the movie do. Today I feel the same way. It's an unrealistic portrayal that doesn't go beneath the surface to explore the character's intentions."},{"rating":"2","title":"a reply to the below review","review":"please dont tell me that you are so naive to think that the activites that took place in kids dont occur. im not saying that every teenager in america behaves like the characters in kids, but obviously you'd be surprised at the percentage of teenagers that do behave in that manner. overall i thought it to be an accurate portrait of kids into that particular \\"scene\\". i think the movie accomplished exactly what it was supposed to do for the below viewer---shock the viewer while not exaggerating what is actually going on in teenage society...WAKE UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a better plot and better actors","review":"keep this short and sweet the telly actor is the worst actor in the wrold.I seen bad actors in my life but telly is like some kid you will beatup everyday.And the plot relly sucked,if i made this movie this is what i would have done.Convertation about the hiv,with jenny and telly. telly feels guilty,and kills him shelf for the pain he inflicted on the girls.And could be more than a wake up call to kids for all the pain you put poeple through and your shelf.

Perhaps it is realistic if you live in inner city New York, or Chicago, but the majority of the world does not live like this.

I saw this a long time ago, and I recently went Best Buy and bought it, and I watched it again, thinking this is about four times worse then the movie \\"thirteen\\" in terms of kids getting in trouble. I love how it shows the downside to having sex - most shows and movies just have the characters go all out, like on \\"Friends\\" and not have any consequences. I think it's good that they show someone with HIV and Telly probably has it too. I think it sucks though that Jenny couldn't tell him in time, or Casper wouldn't have wanted to rape her then, if he had known. I really think that you should buy it, watch, but don't let your kids watch it unless they're headed down the wrong path."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST!","review":"I am not talking about the plot, I am not talking about the acting.

It wont be an easy pill for some to swallow--- and for others it may be all to familiar.The recording is shakey... but that's sort of a signature of the directors.Basically if you can't handle the thought of kids on drugs, having sex, dealing with hiv, being in gangs... dont watch this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, realistic movie.","review":"This is one of the best independent movies of all time. It depicts the lives of some high school students that live in the inner city, and goes through a few days of their lives. It will open your eyes to how youth think and really act."},{"rating":"2","title":"See it Once","review":"I think it's pretty funny that one of the reviewer's uncles rented the movie to watch with his nephew because he thought it was for young kids! In 1995, this movie caused a huge stir. It was on the news, it was panned by the critics for being exploitive, etc. You would have to be pretty isolated not to have heard about it.It was also, I believe, Chloe Sevigny's first film. And she is terrific. The rest of the people in the film are amateur actors and Larry Clark's first film feels like a student film. But somehow, it comes off as artistic. I think the mistake people made is that this was some sort of \\"warning\\" or \\"life lesson\\" film. Larry Clark just thought it would be a good theme for a movie; to take a different route to explain teenage behavior and how the adult world continues to misperceive them. As for taste, the film is more voyeuristic than pornographic, and to tell you the truth, it's lost its shock value over the past nine years.So I suggest: see it once, and then move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blatant reality","review":"This movie accurately portrays what city kids face day to day on the streets. I'm sorry if folks in Ohio cannot fathom such harshness of city life but this is how it is. I would know...a 17-year old teen growing up here in NYC.

They have always been in excellent condition. I have to say that this is the first time, I was not totally satisfied. Although the book was in decent condition, it was not in the condition that I am normally use to with Amazon books. The cover was wrinkled from bending and some of the pages were still turned at the corners and not even fixed before it was shipped. I wish maybe having a picture of the book might be helpful although I realize that this is not practical. All the more the description needs to really apply to the book being purchased.I will give it one more chance before I stop buying used books. Just be leery of used products."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was a rough read","review":"Maybe I went into this book with poor expectations, but I was disappointed on the content and how it was written.

I am sad to say I walked away with very little useful information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for those who are truth seekers.","review":"This is one of those books that will help truth seekers on thier path.

It will also enlighten those already seasoned in this field by bringing a competely unique perspective on the topic.I've been immersing myself in the Jewish Roots revelation for 6 years now, and this amazing book brought an insight I hadn't read in all my years of research.Again, this is a MUST READ!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apologizing for Jesus","review":"A popular but misguided approach to the, \\"can't we all just get along\\" pluralism of our day. When the non-believing Jews told Jesus their father was Abraham, he told them they were terribly mistaken. He said, \\"If your father was Abraham you would have recognized me.\\" Instead he told them their real father was the devil. Jesus certainly wasn't being an anti-Semite, he was a Semite, but he was telling them the truth. The notion that we worship the same God as non-Christian Jews is no different than the idea of embracing all religions as equal. Christians need to stop apologizing for Jesus and understand that what divides us is much greater than what unites us, because what divides us is God. Jay Bugg"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want to understand the Hebraic viewpoint this book is a must!","review":"The best way to understanding the bible is to approach it with the Hebraic viewpoint. This book will explain the in and out of that. The Bible can not be understood by using Greek thinking or your mind. The Spirit reveals truth and the Hebraic viewpoint connects the dots."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is THE place to start","review":"For those of you who want the ground roots study of the Hebraic perspective for the New Testament, this is the place to start. This book covers a broad range of categories yet doesn't intimidate the reader with endless re-translations of text. This book covers the history enough to convince the reader to study further and presents its case in a clear, logical manner that leaves one hungry for a deep investigation. All of the answers aren't here, which is fine, the author's intention is just to pry the door open and stick his toe in. The only negative is that the chapter on Semitic persecution didn't flow well with the rest of the book. I thought it would have been better as an appendix. This book would be a great gift for someone who you doesn't quite understand your point of view if you understand the importance of the Hebraic roots of Christianity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into Jewish lifestyle for any Christian","review":"I have purchased 20 of these books and given them to friends. The search for Christians to reach out and understand their Jewish roots is vital for the correction or misapplication of some of our beliefs. This book points toward a more powerful and insightful lifestyle, and brings understanding to a much needed area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: This book will change your life!","review":"What best review can I give for a book that just changed my whole life? I think the best I can do is to honestly warn other readers about this power: \\"Watch out! This book will change your life!\\" But this will only happen if you read it honestly, with a true desire to acknowledge the title: \\"Our Father Abraham\\". Dr. Marvin Wilson, simply and powerfully, explains what Christians have lost since departing from the Jews. And, of course, what Jews might benefit from the Christian experience. Have you ever watched \\"A Fiddler on The Roof\\"? Well, I hadn't, until I read this book. Now it's one of my favorite movies, because I know what's behind it! In short, if you really want to understand the Hebraic roots of your faith, don't start anywhere else. Buy it right now! And recommend it to as many of your dears as possible.

This just redefined the word bad. It is defecation. The best way to describe this is to imagine an episode of the power rangers meeting an MTV boy band video: It has very bad acting, slow, generic killing scenes (each victim is surround by members of a boy band and smothered so you cannot see what they do to the victim) At least half of the movie is a generic music video (singing throughout the movie) You almost have to see it to believe it, and I definitely wouldn't recommend seeing it. This movie is the equivalent to getting kicked in the groin or going to the dentist. This movie will make you want to hurt someone, or vomit uncontrollably.

Ryan Starr also happens to be the worst actress I have ever watched on film, television and or commercials. The director must have agreed with me becaue there are very few shots of Ryan that last more than 10 seconds at a time. Her dialogue is kept short and simple, and when she does have more than 3 lines at once, the complete lack of feeling, expression & emotion in her voice makes you consider turning off the movie and doing something worthwhile, like cleaning out the fridge or picking at your hang-nails.

But these weren't even zombies, they had grey makeup and looked kind of like the guys from V, the old movie/TV Show, but they didn't even have scales! It was just grey makeup! Do yourself a favor and run, don't walk, away from this film! Cooking with Porn stars was a better buy than this would be, and that movie was REALLY bad. I don't know who thought to sell it for $24, discounted to $22, but if they sell one at that price, it should just about cover the budget for the film with those \\"special\\" effects of the burnt zombies which were really piles of sand from down the beach on the same set."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROLL OVER , PLAY DEAD, AND DON'T STOP","review":"THIS IS ONE OF THE STUPIDEST, SILLY, TOTALLY MISDIRECTED MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN.

It's full of Ayers' odd lyrics and twisted tunes, and features a host of former Soft Machine mates and Island Records chums getting together to make some loopy, off-kilter rock'n'roll. Ayers' dark vision might be mistaken for depression in songs like \\"Don't Let It Get You Down\\" and \\"Shouting In a Bucket Blues,\\" but it's always redeemed by a sense of humor and wit (\\"When Your Parents Go To Sleep\\" and \\"Interview.\\").

If you can get one or two years' regular play value from any board game, you are doing very well. Most don't last a few months. Secondly, the manufacturer, Family Pastimes, always supplies replacement parts at modest cost for mailing expenses, so you don't have to worry about the game becoming obsolete or unplayable.

Based on the reviews that I had read, Caves & Claws seemed like another fun addition to our family collection. However, once we got the game and tried it a couple of times, it hasn't been played since. The rules are a bit vague on several things, and there was never a true sense of \\"Uh-Oh, how are we going to over come this?\\" that make good co-op games so much fun to play. Unless you really aren't trying, it seems impossible to lose.Also, the paper tokens feel like they'll tear at any moment, and the game board and cards are poorly printed. There is a small card in the game that explains that the company uses recyclable materials, but that shouldn't be an excuse to make the game feel cheap.There are better options."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! My son can play board games!","review":"My six-year-old son has such a hard time with typical win/lose games because he feels bad if he loses and he feels bad if his family members lose.

I don't like games where you win or lose!\\" We just finished the first game, and while I think it will get boring after a while, it's easy enough for him to grasp, and has just a little strategy to it to keep it interesting. I agree that it's for younger kids, like the previous reviewer mentioned.

Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between \\"serious\\" works of literature like this one and allegedly \\"lesser\\" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are \\"better\\" than any others, and the concept of a \\"great novel\\" is an intellectual hoax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emma - Noteable for dubious reasons","review":"There is one principle reason that Emma is remembered. It was written by a woman. If Jane Austen had been a man, her works would be regarded as banal and inconsequential works of little literary merit. The work is impressive considering that Austen came from a culture that repressed women (a characteristic that most female authors share), but beyond that it is a poor work.There is a profusion of works of greater literary merit by women than what Austen offers, Mary Shelly's \\"Frankenstein\\", Kate Chopin's \\"The Awakening\\", Alice Walker's \\"The Color Purple\\", \\"Nectar in a Seive\\" by Kamala Markandaya, or a very fine piece \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God\\" by Zora Neale Hurston. All of these works have better characteristics than \\"Emma\\", and prove to be superior to all of Austen's writings.Trust me, \\"Emma\\" is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Romance","review":"Having been forced to read \\"Emma\\" for an English Literature course, I feel that I know as much about it as anyone else, if not more so. \\"Emma\\" is nothing more than a trashy romance, like the rest of Jane Austen's novels. We all know more or less what is going to happen at the end of the book - of course the hero and heroine are going to fall in love. Austen's use of irony is not exemplary either - is there anyone who didn't realise that Frank Churchill was hiding something, if we weren't sure quite what?

She is at the top of her game and everything works: the dialogue, character development and, did I mention, the humor? While teaching Emma in my AP English class this year, I realized that many less talented readers read right over the irony and scathing remarks. Jane Austen is so very funny that she makes better readers out of those who take the time to read her carefully. I have to admit that the movie version of Emma with Emma Thompson is quite good and does the novel some justice. It also helps a first time Austen reader get a flavor for how things looked and sounded in this time period. If you haven't yet started to enjoy Austen, pick up Emma and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful story about relationships","review":"I definitely recommend this book to first time Jane Austen readers, and especially to young girls, for it is so cute and so amusing. I wish I were \\"forced\\" to read this in High School for I would have surely written good papers on it. I can't see how anyone can dislike this classic. Jane Austen's character \\"Emma\\" has her faults of course, be she is a true character that is amusing and utterly charming, unlike those characters in Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, which by no doubt are wonderful books, but Emma truly has to be my favorite Austen work. It is predictable, even without having seen the movie that was based on this work (that mind some of you was written over 200 years before Alicia Silverstone existed...gosh!) but the predictability of it made it all the more enjoyable, like a sort of mystery in romance. I definitely recommend this book to anyone over the age of 11 or 12. I know I'll make my kids read it some day. It is superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps Austen's best","review":"Although Austen's longest novel, Emma is a lot of fun to read. It was areal challenge to make us truly care about this spoiledand meddlesome character. I guess it because it is Emma's depth of feelingand her reactions to all the chaos she creates throughout the book that reallyendear her. That and the fact that in the end everything works out as itshould (no major spoiler that), and all her messes are resolved happily orcomically.I can see why many consider this to be Austen's best work: it has many of thebest qualities of the other work, but it also builds into a mysterywith a surprising resolution, and many characters turn out to be quitedifferent from what we initially suspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifth time reading it....still delightful!!!!","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was 12. Liked it then, love it now. After every movie adaptation, I feel compelled to return to the sour ce and have always found Austin's presentation the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another wonderful novel of a headstrong young woman.","review":"Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women. All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well. Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well. In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse. She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner. She has a good heart, but she is spoiled. She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results. Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village. The village in this story is Highbury. The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book. Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life. Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emma","review":"Received my book 2-3 days after I purchased it! It is in even better shape that I thought it would be in, love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful story with characters who change for the better","review":"As a reader who is tired of cliche romances and characters, I really enjoyed Emma for the unstereotypical main character. Emma is neither wonderfully good with dreadful circumstances (like Jane Fairfax, Jane Eyre, etc.), nor rich and intolerable (like Mrs. Elton, Scarlett O'Hara, etc.), rather she is like many of us today, a well-to-do girl who is nice but has faults. I loved how she grew through the story, slowly realizing more and more of her fundamental issues. Mr. Knightly is the perfect gentleman to everyone and a wonderful friend to Emma because he loves her enough to correct her for her faults. Even so, he grows and improves in the book as well. All of the characters have many facets to their personalities and characters and Austen weaves a beautiful web through the story. Emma is a lighthearted, fun read, yet has depth and relevant themes.I recommend reading this book twice so that it can be fully appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"my personal fave","review":"emma is my favorite jane austen book. im fifteen and have read two other austen novels, pride and predudice and northanger abbey. ill admit that often during the story emma seems selfish and spoiled (and often misuses her sense as mr. knightly once said), but overall her blunders make for a hilarious and wonderful story. ( also i love frank churchill!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the real world","review":"Jane Austen was a great author who without using too complex words made simple stories, with characters you can't forget. She had insights into human nature that make her story meaningful today just as it was in the early 1800's.Emma is a beautiful and fortunate woman who has had only good luck. She thinks she knows it all. But really it's just she hasn't experienced the world. But this belief makes her get involved in the problems of others and disrupts her peaceful life. However it's not that serious, the results are comical and teaches you the important lesson to mind your own business!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhasperatingly delightful!","review":"Though exhasperating at times, Emma enchants us all. It is through Emma's repeated blunders,imprudence, and vanity that she becomes one of the most charming heroines of all times. Jane Austen has created a hilarious set of characters: the preposterously overprotective father, the poor chatterbox neighbour, the pretty, lighthearted protegé, and the man of reason whose love finally dictates against his logic (to name a very few). Although the plot is at times made dreary by Miss Bates' prolongued monologues, the novel is otherwise a light read. One must not expect to turn the last page having learnt some universal truth, but rather having enjoyed a few good laughs, some heart-leaping, and a few sighs. Emma is an outstanding proof of Jane Audten's wit; the candour and modesty in her novel make it a truly refreshing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely book, but long at times!","review":"I found this book extremely interesting, and it held a very unique story line, which seems at times hard to come by in many recently published books. I enjoyed the main character, Emma, whose character was so incredibly... fun, (mainly) mature, rommantic, and exciting all in one. Her want to match everyone with a lover reminds me very much of the premise of the novel A Midsummer Nights Dream. Though some parts extend and go into more detail than it seems necessary, the book is overall worth reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fiona Shaw Takes the Cake","review":"No one reads a book like Fiona Shaw. No matter what she narrates, her voice weaves a golden web, entrapping the listener with great charm and ease.Shaw's narration of Emma is no exception. Jane Austen's ambitious matchmaker and her circle of friends come vibrantly to life as Shaw's beautifully modulated voice gives each character his or her own pitch and tone. You hear Mr. Knightly chide Emma for her recklessness and \\"poor Miss Taylor\\" speculate that Miss Fairfax and Mr. Knightly are \\"a couple.\\" Their voices come alive entrancingly.Austen's story is wonderful to read, but Fiona Shaw makes it an even greater treat to listen to. I give her narration the highest possible recommendation. Here's to more from Ms. Shaw!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I really liked this book, though it took a while to get into it. The plot was solid but it has some of the most annoying characters with Harriet, Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton. Long sections with any of those rather dragged. However, I can recommend this one as it has a great ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax and Enjoy","review":"This book is one of many by Jane Austen that will put you into a total field of happiness. Emma's perilous journey towards understanding herself and her own wrong doings is funny and down to earth. The English is a bit hard to read but once you get into the book, the English becomes easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor KINDLE edition","review":"I'm writing in reference to the Kindle version of this book. Since I like the book itself, I gave 2 stars; however, this version was lacking in extras. I was seriously disappointed to find no footnotes, no introduction, no nothing.

I certainly would have chosen another one of the available editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"It pains me to say this...","review":"As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read. This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college. I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character. And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character. But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer. I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Table of Contents Not Properly Coded","review":"Contrary to another review, this book is not property formatted for Kindle.

One of the pleasures of a Jane Austen novel is the author's deceptively quiet tone; its very understatement sharpens her satire and makes her jokes even funnier. Unfortunately, Miss Scales has adopted the opposite approach, using a hopelessly inappropriate shrill, impatient voice. Given that the opening chapters are dominated by two of literature's most tiresome characters, Emma Woodhouse and her feebleminded father, the result is unbearably irritating. I gave up after an hour, and was glad to track down a far more enjoyable reading by Juliet StevensonEmma (Classic Fiction)- by far the best Austen narrator on the market today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent performance of a classic novel","review":"Prunella Scales is wonderfully talented.

The characters are great though and it is funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matter of personal preference","review":"Although I enjoyed the novel, I believe it is really a matter of personal preference. If you like this kind of books that don't take place in our century and are common to Austen's style (that is, long and elaborate expositions and extensive character development), then Emma is a perfect read.

However, this book was absolutly boring. Out of all of Austens works, which are not all to exciting themselves, this has to be the most boring and drawn out. There are long pauses of nothing but tea and long walks, and once in a while Emma will set up one of her friends. This match does not last long, however. Personaly if I were her \\"friend\\" Harriet, I would think myself better off without her companionship. To my knowledge Jane Austen wrote this \\"little gem\\" for the prince of England whom she did not exactly admire. I wouldn't be surprized if his didn't admire her so much after he finished reading it. If you are looking for a exciting and gripping book do not choose Emma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwww","review":"I hate it. So boring.

I wanted to slap everyone in the book. The only happy ending for this book would have been for all the characters to lose all their money and have to get jobs and actually do something for a living. Yes, I understand the points that Austen was trying to make about social mores etc., but those points were clearly made within the first 20 pages; the remaining 480 were superfluous. I wanted to rate this book higher by saying that \\"although the characters and plot are insipid, annoying, and boring, the writing was wonderful,\\" but I can't, because Austen's writing is almost as annoying as her plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No classic in my mind","review":"After reading Emma by Jane Austin I am very much considering not reading another book by Jane Austen.I was very dissapoited with the book.

I found the book extremely boring and would not recomend it to anyone outside of maybe teenage girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed with Emma","review":"I really tried to continue with this book thinking it would improve, however a third of the way through I finally gave up. It failed to keep my interest & I felt it was a thorough waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bland...","review":"This novel takes forever to get to the point of the story. I couldn't even finish it! Try PRIDE AND PREJUDICE instead - at least it has a plot. Speaking of which, I couldn't understand the plot of EMMA, if there even was one. Try another Austen book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and Fun Reading","review":"Emma is a wonderful story. It's a timeless story and worth reading. Very light and amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Jane Austen but.....","review":"I absolutely loved Pride and Prejudice, and Sense and Sensibility, but I found Emma to be pretty boring. It's not that I didn't like the story- I did, but it was such a tedious thing to read. Anyone who read this book before Austen's others would be turned off. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Reader","review":"Hard to get into due to unfamiliar words. Adjusted as I read more. I did enjoy it very much. A book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Austen's novel is a timeless classic.","review":"Jane Austen's novel Emma is the story of a young woman who at first seems to be self-indulgent and egotistical. As the novel progresses, the reader discovers Emma's selfless nature as evidenced by her foregoing her own romantic ambitions to help others find happiness. The book takes an ironic turn as Emma finds love with Mr. Knightley even though throughout the novel she has used to matchmaking efforts to help others find love. Overall, I find this book to be a light-hearted love story and a refreshing change from the more serious novels of the Victorian period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"A little dragging at first, but now I wouldn't have it any other way. Emma was hard to sympathize with in the begining. She is naive, snobbish and presumptuous. By the end, however, I was praying for her and Knightley to get together. Austen is witty as usual. She is a wonderful narrator. You might wanna check out Pride and Prejudice, which I loved. Her writing is Romantic though, so if that's not your thing, you should think twice before picking up an Austen. She may be wordy, but her writing is by no means difficult to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"This book was pretty good, but I didn't really get into it until about 2/3 of the way in. Emma is a very good book, but if you don't like books about upper class young men and women, I wouldn't recomend it just because you would be very bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but falls short of Pride and Prejudice","review":"When Jane Austen sat down to write Emma, she had a tall order. Her previous work, Pride and Prejudice, is one of the great masterpieces in English literature. Unsurprisingly, Emma does not measure up to P&P, but is still a delightful read in its own right. The same themes that readers have come to associate with Jane Austen are all present in Emma: courtship, marriage, Victorian reserve, and, of course, social status. The biggest problem I had with Emma is that the characterization is not near as solid as in Austen's previous work. The only truly interesting character is the main protagonist, Emma, whose wit and vivacity sparkle throughout. The only fair way to read Emma is to do so without comparing it to Pride and Prejudice. Doing so, this book stands just fine upon its own merit. Just don't expect lightning to strike twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"I have memories attatched to this book. My grandmother read this to me as a little girl, and to this day I enjoy reading the simplicity, the absolute ease of the style. I take this book now and read to my grandmother because she has alziemers. If I didn't have those memories I admit I might not feel so special about it, but those are the memories I never want to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indypublish.com edition is a flimsy computer printout","review":"The name of the publisher should have clued me in to the fact that this edition is only an imitation of a real children's book. Perkins' original book was charmingly illustrated; this has no illustrations at all. This is disorienting as well as disappointing, since even the first line of the text refers to an illustration. The lack of illustrations greatly reduces its appeal to younger children. The edition is flimsily bound, and closely resembles a manual that might come with your new Kenmore washer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sword set","review":"I got the set for some cardio, and aerobics excercise. They are light, and properly sized. The blades are thick enough not to cause alot of damage, but bruises are common. Expected that. Been using them awhile, and no cracks or breaks, but I'm not trying to bludgeon my opponent either. There are some dents in the wood though. There is a large white \\"China\\" sticker at the bottom of the blade though, kinda obvious, but at $10 each, I can get over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electronic Funny Stuff","review":"I enjoy the casio beats and smooth lyrical genious.

How could one be so possesive, so confused, and so tragic. The main characters were played excellently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waylaid, Way Cool.","review":"An outstanding first novel!In Waylaid, Ed Lin deftly navigates the delicate balance between the ire and angst of growing up Asian in a non Asian society with the beauty and poignancy of just growing up. His nameless protagonist begins a journey of self discovery that is as heartbreaking as it is hilarious, as honest as it is raw. Set in a \\"No tell Motel\\" on the Jersey shore, Lin's twelve year old main character finds himself (as we all have at some point in our lives) caught between the rock that is every American man's dream, and the hard place that is every American boy's fantasy. This is a wonderful novel whose universal message should be read and enjoyed by every American, Asian or no. Props to Ed Lin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY COOL!!!","review":"I picked this book up at the library as I remembered seeing stuff that was on the cover before, I live in NJ too, as this book is set in NJ. I loved this book, it ranks right up there with Green Grass Grace by Shawn McBride. I read it all in 3 hours. Great book. A great read for a rainy afternoon or a hot day at the beach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult page-turner","review":"While I agree with the reviewers, I am compelled to mention that the paperback edition I bought is PHYSICALLY the most difficult book I have ever read! The cover stock is so stiff and the margins in the spine-side of the pages are so narrow that I am using muscles in my hand that I didn't know I had - just to keep the book open and view all of the print. It's the most aggravating exercise and diminishes any enjoyment I might have in reading the book. I have actually considered giving up. I hope for the sake of others that mine is the only flawed copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waylaid","review":"The book was good. It's hard to believe what the main character's life was like, but probably not that far off for many Chinese kids. The main character is a kid, but it's not written for kids, so he doesn't sound like a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"The DVD was better than expected. Received the DVD before Christmas even though I was almost too late ordering it. Thanks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless...","review":"Obviously, the only reason Disney had for making this movie was to test their newly created CAPS animation system, because other than a few impressive uses of that, this forgettable sequel has nothing more to offer. While The Rescuers remains one of the studios most beloved animated, this one simply falls way back being one of the most uninteresting and bland Disney releases of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disgrace to both original film and Margery Sharp!","review":"This Disney sequel, \\"inspired by characters created by Margery Sharp\\" totally rips the appeal of the original novels and the original Disney animated classic. This sequel hardly captures Sharp's world, it only offers the same title characters but those have become probably the most boring characters in the film. The whole thing has turned into a modern day \\"adventure.\\" I really don't have much to say about the plot other than it seems to me as a remake of the first film.Even though the first film twisted Sharp's world a lot, it was still a fine piece of beautiful animation and smart storytelling. This sequel has nothing especial and has no heart. Skip it. There are better films out there. Too bad for Bernard and Bianca, though...

The animation is beautiful (flying with the great golden eagle, the Australian Outback), and it moves at a brisk pace (but never feels empty).

Nothing happens here that relates to the first movie, there was no need for it at all!But to have Miss Bianca and Bernard marry?! That's like shooting Margery Sharp!

The movie was a complete failure which discouraged Disney from ever paing enough attention to another sequel and it's thanks to this that we now get stuff like Cinderella 2 or 101 Dalmatians 2 with a few rare highlights like Return to Neverland or Lady and the Tramp 2. The Rescuers Down Under is no where near as good as the first one, there is no heart to it. Neither the story nor the characters held up and just the whole idea isn't very convincing. It is too much like the original (Which makes this unoriginal) but not in the way it should be. It features no songs and there's no emotion to it.The only thing the movie has that makes it good is the title, the \\"2\\"s make the films like this look like total trash even though that's what they are basically. Total trash. Don't buy.0/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"No need for it","review":"There was absolutely no need for this sequel to be made, the original The Rescuers was great and it fully ended and closed up everything.

The children automatically gravitated to it and loved it! I taught some children how to play it, and they picked up the rules perfectly. The older children would set the board up on thier own and show the others how to play the game. Not once did I see them fight over the peices or the rules. They really enjoyed it and I would recommend it in the classroom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to learn Yoga","review":"This product is a very fun way for kids to learn yoga poses.

There are lullaby songs, short little segments that are typical of the other Teletubbies vidoes make this a good video to watch for five to ten minutes before turning off the TV.

The film does follow the book for most of it, but the director has certain parts. He has tried to improve the plot, but after reading the book, it somewhat makes the plot worse.This is a reasonable conversion, children and people who haven't read the book will find it an average cartoon but for people that have read it will find it disappointing because the main characters are missing, main parts are missing, and some parts are randomly changed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product good, service grand","review":"I purchased this DVD for use in my classroom.

Created may be too strong a word however. If I remember the report correctly, the CIA funded both of these projects while demanding some alterations be done. The fact that the pigs in this movie do not stand alongside the humans at the end, like in the book, is due directly to the CIA's influence.The report was on the new book \\"The Cultural Cold War\\", which can also be found at Amazon.com (grin grin).

All voices by Maurice Denham. A good film. Interesting to see a fully animated film made in the 50s NOT by Walt Disney. In spite of being funded by the CIA, the film is surprisingly devoid of communism. Napoleon the pig(Stalin) could easily be Mussolini, Obama or any other tinpot dictator. The film scrubs up Snowball(Trotsky) something fierce and actually has a relatively happy ending. That said, the book is depressing and the movie is still quite brutal especially for the time period. Definately worth a look. Just do not go in expecting singing mice and dancing fairies."},{"rating":"1","title":"For absolute beginners only","review":"If you have any knowledge of Spanish vocabulary, do not buy this CD.

Elsie Egermeier did a great job interpreting Holy Scripture for tiny kids without getting pedantic or avoiding the facts. While it contains both Old and New Testaments, it is suitable for Jewish children. I would choose this book over the smarmy \\"Uncle Arthur's\\" or any other retelling of Bible stories for kids. Bring back the old edition, with its classy dark cover with the famous portrait of Christ on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bible Story Book ever","review":"Elsie Egermeier's retelling is simple and direct. Growing-up I learned the scope and sequence of the Bible as Egermeier's was read front to back again and again. She included most all of the stories and told them without sentiment or apology. Adults will find this a great way to read through the Bible for themselves. Families and teachers will find it a reliable resource for children, youth, and adults.I wish it were in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egermeier's Bible Story Book","review":"We thought we were getting the original version rather than a revised one.

I think it would make an excellent 1st Communion gift! We also bought the Golden Book Bible, so that we could compare the two. My husband and I both liked Egermeier's better. I tried reading it to my 5 year old, but it didn't hold his attention. I think it would be a great Bible for a 7 or 8 year old. It has a picture about every 2 pages. I think that if it had a picture on every page, it would hold our son's attention. The Golden Book Bible was very good, and it had pictures on every page. I think Egermeier's is easier for a child to read and understand! I have really enjoyed reading it myself. I have a hard time putting it down!

It is the Bible Story Book that my parents read to me before I was old enough to read, and I continued to read the wonderful Bible stories on my own for many years. I purchased a copy for my child and each of my grand children as well as the children of many of my relatives. The stories are presented in language that is easy for children to understand, and is exciting for them to hear and read. The only way to really appreciate this book is to read it aloud with children, listen to their questions and comments, and share with them the great stories of the Bible. To say the least, I highly reccommend this wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful illustrations and paraphrase of the Bible","review":"I like this Bible because it's a paraphrase, and thus easier for children to understand, and because it has pretty illustrations.

Warriors #1, Into the Wild, follows the story of a house-cat, Rusty, who is drawn into the forest and the tradition-bound cat clans who live within. Starting out as an apprentice and gaining both friends and enemies, Rusty - remaned \`Firepaw' by his clan - sets out to prove that cats of \`kittypet' origin can survive just as well in the wild as forest-born cats. Very engaging to read, the sort of story that packs as much action as it can between the pages. Erin has done a fantastic job creating the world of her cats, with a partial language, traditions, histories, and definite way of life for them. A gripping tale and an excellent introduction into the feline world for older and younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best... to good","review":"At first I didn't mlike cats a lot.

It is well written, and although it has a wide vocabulary, you can understand the words the Erin Hunter uses. Warriors definately deserves 5 stars. The series has a fast paced story line, and relates the adventures of cats with human stuggles. Although in some books, the depression that the cats go through is almost un-bearable, most of the times the books are light and cheerfull. I would recomend these books to any young reader who enjoys books like Inkheart, Harry Potter, and Time Stops for No Mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book","review":"It's great for kids 9+ it has a great moments in it .

Then he decides to become a forest cat himself. A lot of older readers with he age 12 & up will think this book sounds stupid because of this review but it's now my favorite series of books.

My 8 year old daughter absolutely loves them, but what little I have read when reading with her is just gawd-awful. Thank goodness she can read these by herself. I find it hard to believe the spectacular ratings these books have received here. I found the writing to be almost unbearable. The author uses the same few adjectives, verbs and adverbs over and over again, and she seems incapable of writing a sentence that does not contain the repetitive names of two or more cats. Has she never heard of pronouns? Maybe the story is compelling, I wouldn't know, but no story could be compelling enough to make me wade through this horrible writing. True, the target audience of these books is very young, but writing for a third-grader does not mean one has to write LIKE a third-grader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm....","review":"lots of hype and a lot of marketers on my favorite boards telling me to run out and buy.........

I don't want to have to explain to my son what at \\"Cutter\\" is and why cat's would be afraid of it. I don't think that young children should be hearing about the pleasure that cats (or any animals) get from a fresh kill. Those just aren't the types of things I want to introduce to him at his age. This book should really be targetted for older children (teenagers), not young readers. Besides the issue of the target audience, I do feel the writer does capture the feelings of cats as best as a human can capture an animals \\"feelings\\", but I also think that the writing is not particularly polished or engaging.

Perhaps children would like it (I myself love animals), but it wasn't thought-provoking enough.The characters' names somehow bothered/annoyed me. I liked the idea of cats running about in clans, but I simply did not like their society, their family itself.Erin Hunter has a tendency to include far too many characters.

So I'll share our experience reading this series as a family. My 9 year old liked it. The prose and plots held the adults' attention. But with time, we felt the series was kind of oppressive. There's very little joy or positive energy in these books. The cats spend most of their time on the defensive, getting hurt. And because it is a series, there's a lot of rehashing between books. I also noticed that my child hasn't asked to read any of the author's other series.

I reccomended it to all my friends,but only one stuck with them. When you first get this book, don't put it down and say \\"it's too boring! \\". Read on. Then try to read Fire and Ice.

She reads them at night instead of helping clean up dishes. She has organized her friends into clans. They have clan meetings and put clan marks all over the things in our back yard.I've read the first couple of the books, starting with Into the Wild, and I can see why she loves them. The characters are so well drawn that you feel like you really know them. They face real moral dilemmas and behave in complex ways. Erin Hunter does not talk down to her readers. There's humor but no silliness. Very good books.My daughter is in fourth grade, but she reads at sixth grade level. The reading level of these books is like 5.5 or 6.0.

When Darren got to the top of vampire he discovered that when all the vampires get to Vampire Mountain a ceremony takes place.In the book I had a few questions. Like, \\"what are the trials of initiation?\\" But it was never answered. The author captured me with this book. He used a lot of explanatory words. I also like horror books about vampires.

From blistering rock (Dirty Juice, Love Transmission), soul (ICU in Everything, Conquistadors), and pop (Imaginary Ships, Angela Dangerlove), this CD is one that will never grow old.

I requested it from my public library and had to wait a couple of months for it to become available. After part 1, pg. 160 (Nick's first \\"love\\" affair), the book was due back, and I gladly returned it. Read the other 1-star reviews, and I TOTALLY agree with those in-depth reviews.I found it impossible to \\"relate\\" to and/or care about ANY of the characters in this book--two important criteria for a \\"good\\" book-- in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Did not care for this book.

Don't waste your time, you never care for the characters, nor did I want to get to know them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful writing","review":"This is a remarkably well-written book, and a compellingly good read---quite an accomplishment given that there isn't a single likable character in it, not even the housekeeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish","review":"I agree with a previous critic that this is one of the worst books ever to win the Booker.

Don't get me started on its attempt to be shocking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tremendous, unmitigated downer","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. A perversion of an unquestionably great talent (and I don't mean the sex). The worst thing in art is using talent to send out a message that is without hope.There is a lot of very explicit sex in this book. No problem with that. The problem is that none of these mostly very unlikeable people learns anything, grows as a person, shows any degree of integrity or finer human qualities. They show the worst side of humanity, something worth looking at, but without a spark of hope for something better, it is just a collosal bummer.True art uplifts, inspires, enlightens. It makes us face up to the worst of ourselves and ultimately makes us glad to be human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nig-Nog?","review":"One wishing to learn about racism in the gay community would do well by reading the collected novels of Mr. Hollinghurst. The graphically brutal rape of the white protagonist by the black cook near the end of The Swimming Pool Library is disturbing; but no less so than Hollinghurst's gratituous use of racial slurs and the stereotypical depiction of the \\"black\\" council clerk, Leo, in this contemporary \\"masterpiece\\".Not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish","review":"Don't waste your money.

I gave it an extra star because it really is well-written but, my God, how boring! I'll never understand why books like this win prizes. I finished the book with a hope and a prayer that something would happen. Please someone get killed or pregnant or arrested or something! The only time things actually moved along were the last 30 pages. It seemed liked it was about the family throwing jabs at each other and everyone else. The family on vacation; the father running for office; the daughter and her manic-depression. I was constantly wondering \\"what did they mean by that?\\". Since the book is set in London and the author is a Brit. there were references and some slang that I simply could not understand being an American. I might even try to rent the movie -- maybe that was more interesting?I don't see myself going out and trying to find another Hollinghurst novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing beautiful about it","review":"I had such high hopes for this book - nominated for all those prizes! If you're looking for gay fiction then this book is for you. It should be sold with the porn magazines - the first 100 pages ramble on and on about gay sex - but never get to a storyline. I tried to endure. I kept hoping there was a story! I grew up in Britain and thought this sounded like a great perspective on the Iron Lady (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher) and 80's Britain. But it's just about a guy trying to fit in with a bunch of snobbish upper class twits! Oh yes, and there's lots of gay sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting people doing uninteresting things while saying really really uninteresting things","review":"I thought I would really enjoy this book as it takes places in a neighborhood of London in which I lived many years ago. But the characters are perhaps the most uninteresting I have ever encountered in a novel and their precious dialogue is beyond boring. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because there is a lot of good writing in this book - but to no purpose. Highly unrecommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather disappointing","review":"Read the book on a transatlantic flight and afterwards, but found it rather tedious. As a portrait of a chattering society, Proust did unmeasurably better and we don't need any more of that. As to the main character, Ripley (Highsmith) comes to my mind and he was a much more interesting character than Nick. And as a piece of political satire, it is also not very exciting or revealing. Whether it is a profound portrayal of gay life, I cannot judge. The book just did not engage me on any of these levels, and as a Booker winner it is quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"The writing is very good, but the true and simple test of a novel is to ask oneself these questions: Do I care about the characters? Can I stop reading this book right now and never wonder about how it ends? If you answer no to the first question and yes to the second, it is not a good work of literature. The Line of Beauty is, unfortunately, one of these novels. Tedious, overly mannered and stifling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciatingly boring and self absorbed","review":"I looked forward to this book with anticipation. But I soon found myself bored beyond belief. I defy anyone to give a damn about the characters and the plot (if there is one) is interminably slow to develop.

It's an awful lot of slogging through boring upperclass British nattering, punctuated by somewhat startling little bursts of graphic sex. It was an odd juxtaposition. However, if you're keen on fairly hot gay sex scenes, this book's for you! Nick Guest, the main character, is not terribly interesting and I was sorry to have spent so much time in his company. I'm just glad I read quickly because I'd be mad if I invested any more than a few days' worth of subway rides on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"despite the praises","review":"I couldn't finish this book. This book is not for me. I plodded through descriptions after descriptions of flowers, mansions, people's dresses, and parks in which anonymous sex takes place. I don't feel any story that ties the book together. I skipped to the ending and saw the ravages of AIDS on Nick, the main character, and people around him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I found reading the book very tedious.

I had to read the book for a book club, or I wouldn't have finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such promise; such disappointment","review":"Perhaps I will be accused of owning tickets to \\"Short Attention-Span Theatre,\\" but my best efforts to plow through this lush but frank effort were all for naught. Hollinghurst, as advertised, possesses a wondrous facility for words; even the most mundane acts are described with a fluent accuracy that the reader is inclined, often, to exclaim, \\"yes, that's it. He said it perfectly!\\" Nevertheless, lovely writing does not a compelling novel make, and that, combined with a penchant for a relentless gay-dominated, \\"where's my next man?\\" theme, simply left me at the station. Others may choose to take this ride, especially if first chapter anal male sex is your metier, but even this tolerant reader was looking for more than the constant longing found in Nick's loins. Fine writing can be found elsewhere in countless more compelling efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Long Read, But Well Worth The Dedication!","review":"I stayed up late tonight to finally finish this book. Seems like I really didn't care for the characters, but did appreciate their composure. I also by-passed the sex scenes(of course- I'm an Amish author.) Anyway, I thought I was in history class again at moments like the social differences and political influences. It really wasn't a book that I usually purchase, but I gave it a chance when I heard it won the Booker Prize. It didn't let me down! On a scale of 1 to 10, it gets a 10!

I just had to pause and relate my experience with this for a moment. I'm finding it quite tedious. Perhaps it's simply over my head, as a wholly American girl, but a lot of the themes and references are British through and through. The same sense of dry humor and caustic wit that is typical of English theater is clearly evident here. There is no doubt that it is well written, but I simply haven't yet fallen in love with the characters. Nor have I any idea what the plot actually IS yet. In the first few chapters, we are treated with an explicit gay sex scene. If this is not your cup of tea, then definitely don't buy this book. Oddly, I found this part to be interesting... maybe it's because it's a world with which I am decidedly unfamiliar. I plan to wade through the rest of it, and I hope that it picks up.

I reached the end of that book resenting the forced separation and wanting to hang out with the whole lot for a lot longer.Since then, each subsequent Hollinghurst novel has been more disappointing than the last. In the latest, \\"The Line of Beauty,\\" his literary go-cart has come nearly to a halt. The writing is still elegant, studded with memorable turns, but the story is utterly without consequence, ditto the characters. Is Hollinghurst writing or doing his nails? Verdict: don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I enjoyed and was deeply impressed by his other books, especially the first two. He's not afraid of depth of character or complexity or humor. So what went wrong here? It's well written, line my line, but I didn't care a hoot about any of the characters. Good writers know that even if you're creating a shallow character and and even a shallow era he or she should be interesting, have edges, etc. The set-piece: the party near the end is great. The last section felt manipulative. Well, he's still a good writer and I'll surely give his next book a read. As to he Booker's.

Thats all there is. No plot, no suspense, no conflict, no characterization, no development of anything--you could shuffle the chapters and it would make no difference in either the novel's outcome or rampant boredom. It is simply a litany of shallow upper class stereotypes making prissy comments about the insignificant concerns in their lives--i.e. a character's \\"confusingly firm buttocks ... set off by his tight Fred Perry shorts.\\" That's about the depth of character insight one gets in this novel.

If I wanted to know about the contents of a wealthy family's house I would prefer to look at Architectural Digest or some other glossy of the rich.[...] The difference is significant. His characters are men who have sex with men and they seem amazed by the behavior of straight folks. But they wholeheartedly support the status quo. They know how to be excruciatingly polite and cultured but they never let real feeling get in the way of grand pretensions.Hollinghust's \\"satire\\" of the ruling class recalls a story of a minister who abhorred pornography so much that he had to see every variety so he could protest them all.

For a book about boys, it reads entirely too much like a book about coping with a chomosome abnormality -- the abnormality being the Y chromosome. Her general thesis is that the Y chomosome causes boys to develop more slowly and to be more succeptible to many other problems. Her approach to the discussion is very biologically deterministic. I found the 1 chapter on little boys in RAISING CAIN much more useful to understanding what my 4-year-old son is going through than this whole book. She is a strong believer in holdling boys back a year from Kindergarten. If you are looking for arguments for keeping your son back, this book may be what you are looking for. The publisher claims that this is the only book of its type, focusing on the parenting of young boys. That appears to be the case, which is a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book for kids in fifth grade. My favorite part was the end.

It tells about a boy whose name is Henry Huggins, wanted a bike of his own. But his parents won't give Henry the money for the bike. Henry did every thing he could by selling bubble gum at school and helping out with his friend Scooter's paper route. But something always went wrong somehow. But Henry's friend, Beezus, helped Henry a little bit for the bike money. Though some parts are not very realistic, for example Henry ate a can of Dog Food, I still love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book.","review":"In a time when kids had to work hard to get what they wanted, Henry wanted a bike, and got it...in a most unusual and creative way. This is a charming book that portrays a humorous, realistic, unsentimental friendship between a boy and a girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"No effort...","review":"Now, I really liked Suspiria, but it shows that they put little effort into Conflict.. mainly because there are only 5 or 6 new songs on it, which are all just average.

It probes the on-going cultural war of ideas between the Left and Right. I also recommend the Vision of the Annointed by Sowell and Intellectuals by Paul Johnson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold Examinations","review":"This is a wonderful work by Thomas Sowell. It is a bit challenging to read at times, but, as you do the context and implications of what he is explaining becomes painfully clear. We are currently experiencing a resurgant Unconstrained movement in this country and it will take many people with the Constrained vision to quell the uprising."},{"rating":"2","title":"clarity of thought","review":"This book is extremely well organized and the logic of thought is excellent. The issue and the core of the problem are so well defined and the single line of argument is being bulit step by step. People often argue on political issues without knowing what're the counterpart's assumptions, and this book offers a clear explaination of the source of the conflict. The same kind of conflict of visions actually not only exists in the US, as I was thinking about the difference btw. confucianism and Taoism in ancient China and the assumptions used by both sides (constrained and unconstrained visions) is strikingly similar to today's left and right's parties. This book leads me to think of things I've never thought about, and the clarity of thought is the hallmark of Dr. Sowell, whether you agree with him or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Forrester.......","review":"I love Thomas Sowell for his clear mindset and philosohy. I read almost nothing else but philosophy, and Sowell is at the top of my list for clarity, understanding and delivery. He does not receive, in my opinion, the recognition for his genius he is due. A must read.... as is all of Thomas Sowells books"},{"rating":"2","title":"Point of View matters","review":"Sowell's analysis of the differing viewpoints, practice and results between the liberal progressive anointed vision and the tragic conservative republican vision of life and society.

It's not an easy read but worth the extra effort required to understand what's being presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough reading, but worth the effort!","review":"If you want to know why Republicans believe what they do, and why Democrats believe what they do, read this book. Evenhanded (although Sowell is a conservative market capitalist), this work gives you great insight into the variying politics of freedom, equality, and justice ... regardless which side of an issue you're on. Unlike Sowell's weekly editorial columns, which are pretty easy to read, this work is unnecessarily packed with \\"very large words.\\" Read slow, and keep your dictionary handy, because \\"Conflict Of Visions\\" is truly excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, Insightful, Useful, and Practical","review":"I must admit I found Thomas Sowell somewhat difficult to understand. However, given the abstract nature of the book, I'm not sure many writers could have written much better. But once you get into the frame of mind and synchronize with Sowell's presentation flow, it becomes readily apparent that this man is a deep thinker with useful insights into the basis for political ideologies. The book is not especially historical with regards to shifts in political attitudes. However, he does present political ideologies in such a way that allows the reader to compare and contrast and to understand the essential basis for the differences in those ideologies. A definite must-read for the political junkie and certainly for any political science student. Just be prepared to concentrate like you never have before and I think you too will appreciate the insights of Thomas Sowell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't been edited!","review":"Can't believe this book was sold.

So much more pressure is put on your hands and arms when your front tire is lower than your back. This is fine in real world biking, because that means greater ability to steer while going downhill, but in stationary biking, all it does is make your hands uncomfortable.The only con I can think of is I really don't see why it costs as much as it does, but it does feels really sturdy (I weigh 330lbs, no problems with my massive frame)If you are buying a trainer, you need something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This is a great climbing block with three different heights.

It stabilizes your front wheel for those really intense workouts and the height of one is just enough to add a little something to your workout.

Great buy as a trainer accessory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with design","review":"I recently purchased an indoor trainer, and decided to purchase this accessory. I thought that it would have a space in it so the front wheel is level with the rear wheel. However, it is designed so that whichever space the front wheel is in, it is always above the rear wheel. I was unaware that this block did not have a space in it to keep the front wheel at a level position. The trainer provides plenty of resistance, so I don't always want to feel like I'm climbing. I think someone needs to re-think this design."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"This product was just what I wanted.

The only thing that saves it is the song Cadillac. Other than that, this cd is about as good as shoving forks into your ears. It has some semi-decent music, but the lyrics are so [bad] it isn't natural. I think their are so many bands that are better than M.E.S.T.

I was right. But there is more to this CD than that. The first song, \\"Opinions\\" isn't really about relationships. \\"Cadillac\\" is a fun song just about going out and having fun. Sure, Tony talks about his girlfriend a bit in there, but the song is still fun. The only thing that confuses me about that song is where the scratching comes from. This CD turned me into a fan for life. Once I heard this CD I told a bunch of friends about and urged them to buy a CD. Most of them did.

These songs are chelsea, yesterday, drawing board, living dead (and the excellent hidden track), aswell as a few others. But there are a few songs which are truly shocking. Really bog-standard pop-punk which sound like they were written in 5 minutes after listening to blink 182 (don't get me wrong- great band), just to fill the album up. These are songs like breaking down and f**d up kid. But if you can look past the few bad songs, this album is mostly fantastic.

They can really pull ska off aswell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Punk Band","review":"Mest may just seem like another one of the power punk groups that have come about in the last couple years, but they really have their own style that they bring which helps set them apart from other bands of this nature.

Although I do think that Wasting Time is a better all around CD, Destination Unknown has a lot of catchy tracks. It has many good songs that can relate to anybodys daily life. The guitar parts in all the songs are also very catchy because they throw a variety of riffs and chords that mix very well.

This is definately a great Cd for all punk lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"mest is soo damn great!","review":"umm to put this in a few simple words ... mest rocks and so does this cd. \\"destination unknown\\" is one of the greatest cds i own, and i own well over 350 cds. this is just one of the cds i can put in my cd player and listen to it until i fall asleep, and thats usually after around 4 times of it playing over and over again. mest is not just some band that just has songs that are all joking, sure they have some funny songs, but songs such as \\"drawing board\\" have some meaning to it. to summerize GET THIS CD NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly as listed.","review":"I usually never write a review unless the product is exceptional or a total piece of *&(^(^. This product is in the former group. I ordered this on a Monday and received it the next day. I did not pay or order overnight shipping. That's pretty impressive. Granted, their shipping facility might be next door to me someplace, but even so, it came lightening fast.The product itself is exactly as detailed here on this website. Is it a top of the line unit? No, but neither is the price. I am concerned with the reviews out there which detail the length of time between failures, but we'll address that when that happens. This product carries a longer warranty period (3 years). It makes instant hot water and it's quiet coming out the spout with no splatter. What else can you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insinkerator H-990W-SS","review":"Installed this unit a little over 3 yrs ago and now find it leaking as so many others have experienced. Upon dis-assembly of the tank (which is SS) one finds that they use plastic sleeve inserts for the water lines and the drain plug. On my unit the water is seeping out at the drain plug between the plastic sleeve and the tank. The sleeve is glued into the tank so no real way to repair without busting out the plastic. This design concept is a real weak link in the product. A well engineered design would have the fittings brazed or welded into the tank itself.Not impressed at all with the durability of this product so really would not recommend to anyone unless you just want to spend money and more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy One to Install--But a Second as Backup","review":"We installed the first InSinkErator H990C Hot Water Dispenser in 1999. We have replaced it twice. Both times the tank began leaking and flooded the space under the sink. We enjoy the convenience the product offers, but just wish the design of the tank was more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This is a replacement for an older model H990 unit that was dying after 10 years of use. The upper portion of the unit is identical, but the undersink heater unit appears to be made of plastic, not metal, like the previous model (which had a copper tank enclosed in styrofoam enclosed in sheet metal). Notably, the other unit ran silent but this model--which you think would be an improvement--makes a very noticeable \\"roaring\\" sound when heating the water, audible over a low TV or conversation even from under the sink. Also, the water out of the tap is about 30 degrees cooler (170 vs. 200) at the \\"factory preset\\" thermostat setting. Product description on Amazon is confusing and contradictory: is it a 1 yr or 3 yr warranty? 120 or 115 volts? 2/3 gallon or 1/2 gallon tank? It gets the job done, but it's the little things like this that give the impression of diminishing quality from the InSinkErator brand, and at this price point you expect more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my idea of DVDA","review":"A drum machine and a synthesizer. Poor quality. Just because the instruments whizz about the room does not excuse the lack of quality. In my opinion a waste of money. Please buy it so I don't feel I am the only one getting robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"We listened to this once, and kept thinking, \\"When will this end?\\" It sounds like someone had a cheap synthesizer system, and put it together in their basement. After listening to this version, we put on a stereo recording we had of Bolero by a real orchestra. The difference was astonishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative recording","review":"Ok so its DVD-Audio DTS etc. The acutal recording is boring and not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but a little weird","review":"Maybe I should have read the fine print a bit more closely before ordering this. Quite honestly, this had been done before, by Isao Tomita, and his still remains the definitive version for me. The sonics were OK, but the movement of the \\"instruments\\" was very distracting. In too many places, the notes were changed away from a minor key to a major. I came away from this not at all satisfied. The DVD featured both the DVD-A and DTS-ES versions, and an accompanying CD also featured the DTS-ES. They could have also included DTS96/24 along with the ES. All in all, I'd say save your money. This one just wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"My rating for this product is no stars at all. Of maybe a dozen versions of this wonderful piece of music that I have heard in almost 60 years of music enjoyment, this piece must be the worst. I was so hungry for DVD-Audio surround sound recordings that I purchased two recordings from this company \\"ears unheard\\". This was the worst waste of money I have ever encountered. I would mail the disks back to the company to let them know my displeasure but it isn't even worth the postage.Yes, it is indeed a synthesizer all the way through. Feel free to purchase it but only if you totally understand that this is an experimental piece playing around with surround sound recording. DO NOT BUT IT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A DVD RECORDING OF A REAL ORCHESTRA."},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive mistake","review":"I was very dissappointed in this disc. Syntesized instruments don't even come close to reproducing Boleros majesty,not to mention many were out of key,and it was a poor quality attemt at reproducing the sounds of the symphony instuments!!! Don't waste your money,I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"stop punishing yourself with MSDN","review":"Dino tells all in this superb and in depth look at XML on Microsoft's .NET platform. The book is well organized, starting at the fundamental classes and then branching out to the high abstraction level .NET classes and other Microsoft products such as SQL Server 2000 and Internet Explorer.As an example of why this book is so wonderful, there have been several situations where I needed to do something in XSLT that just didn't seem practical (maybe not even doable). The section on how to use standard .NET languages such as C# from XSLT is itself worth the price of admission.Keep in mind that readers are expected to have a good grasp of XML; the book is a .NET book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Advanced readers only","review":"I am a proficient MSXML coder but i can't get what I want (knowledge about .Net XML programming objects) from this book because the author habitually relies on advanced concepts from related technologies to explain things. So unless you are a pretty competent .Net programmer and already proficient in ADO.Net/ADO you will struggle to understand this book and struggle to understand the significance of what you are being told and why. I gave up and resorted to looking for articles on MSDN. Undoubtedly there is good stuff here but Mr Esposito writes as an extremely knowledgeable person for the already extremely knowledgeable person only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urrà! Signor Dino scores again!","review":"Signor Dino is a prolific author - his books and MSDN Developer magazine articles are precise and most helpful. This book is a *practical* one with actual source code to illustrate the XML .NET libraries. Some knowledge of XML fundamentals is assumed and to thoroughly understand the XML .NET library, one must examine the source code along with the book. It is also a major plus that the source code is available in both C# & VB.NET (download from the MSPress site).'I libri, come gli amici devono essere pochi e ben scelli'- Books, like friends, should be few and well chosen.

I find it stale, predictable, almost embarrassing to listen to. I will never buy music again without getting a sound sample. Oh, this stinks. Rob, buddy, if you are the most creative person in the universe, why did you do this to us? Maybe your spirit wants to take your ego back into the yin."},{"rating":"2","title":"MP3 Heaven!","review":"I can now play my MP3s & WMAs in the car! What a wonderful gift to myself! It works perfectly in my in-dash cassette player. I highly recommend this product to anyone with a cassette player. It definitely gives that player new life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Horrible","review":"This product is horrible and should be avoided at all cost. Sound quality is very mediocre (if you set the volume of the iPod in the middle -- if the volume is too high, the adapter sounds terrible). But worst of all, it doesn't work longer than 5 minutes since it goes into auto reverse mode and stops working altogether. Do not buy this (no wonder the cost is only 2 cents, with $2.99 for S+H so you can't even get your money back)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the penny it cost","review":"The seller provided timely shipping. However the product is junk. The sound is muffled and intermittently goes up and down when I move the input cable. I guess you if you buy cheap you get cheap.

There are other Christie books that are more exciting or more clever than this, but she is in top form here. Characterizations have a bit more psychological depth here than in her other books; the monstrous mother and the near-psychotic daughter, in particular, stand out as memorable creations.Read the book and the play; Christie adapted the novel for the stage herself, and made two changes: she removed Poirot, and changed the identity of the murderer. Typical of Christie, both versions of the story work equally well."},{"rating":"1","title":"another poor one","review":"Another very ordinary 'Poirot'. The Belgian sleuth is travelling in the middle east with a group which includes a horrible American matriarch.This horrible bit of goods gets the chop and because she's such a nasty piece of work she deserved it.Its very hard to get involved in the story when there is absolutely no sympathy for the victim.Anyway, Poirot sets out to solve the murder and he does but with one of the real cheat endings of Christie's career . The reader should at least have an outside chance of solving the murder but this one gives you no hope. Not great. (1938)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystery to be Me","review":"I am enjoying reading all my mystery books. Never realized till now, how well Agatha could write. These are mysteries without all the horror and sometimes a real stretch of the imagaination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appointment with Death","review":"This book is a great read. Every time that I read it, for whatever reason, I just cannot remember who killed her. LOL! The characters are great - you can really identify with a lot of them. And of course the touch of romance that is added in, that's always nice. If you are a fan of Dame Agatha, or like a good murder mystery, read this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A fair-to-good Christie novel...","review":"\\"Appointment with Death\\" is full of shocks as Agatha Christie's books usually are, but is nowhere near as interesting as \\"Death On The Nile\\" or even \\"Evil Under The Sun\\". For \\"Appointment with Death\\", I would recommend renting the video (starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot, featuring Lauren Bacall & Sir John Gielgud, Director: Michael Winner 1988) which, strangely, has more shocks than the book! Not at all bad, but not to be read before the thrills of the Nile river and the Orient Express trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book but so much of racial prejudice","review":"I liked reading Agatha Christie's novels and are of a good time pass. This book definitely is not worth reading, to my taste. I found it very disturbing that she compares the sadistic villain of this book with the Buddha. Just because she is fat ! I mean how would one feel if someone says the fat and monstrous jesus like psychopath ?! I expected some dignity from such a highly regarded author, but there it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"Although i agree with the other reviewers that this Christie is different from the others I still found it very enjoyable.

I have to say this is simply the bestshampoo product on the market today - bar none."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 good movie & 2 fair ones","review":"The Sell Out is the best of these 3. Good acting by Richard Widmark. For the other two movies, Inside man would be second best and kept my interest well enough. Hangmen though is a different story. Too much gunplay & people getting killed. I only sat through it for the Sandra Bullock parts since this was her very first movie. She was good & the rest of the picture was so so.Expect the picture quality to be slightly soft (like VHS) due to the compression needed to put 3 movies on one DVD. The sound on all 3 is mono plus the movies are all full screen format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Man","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers on this one. This is a dreadful, dreary awful movie. With Dennis Hopper in it, I was hoping for more than a B movie. The story line is a good one, a true story about a Russian submarine able to sneak into Norwegian waters. The acting is poor, the characters are predictable. The action star even drives a Trans Am (in Norway non the less). If you like submarine movies, there is about 30 seconds of submarine time in the whole movie. Even the Michael Dudikoff sub movies are better than this one. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Lover","review":"The movie was satisfactory as far as the plot. The DVD was terrible in the transfer. I've had this movie about six months and have attempted to watch it many times, but never got past the first 15 minutes due to the poor quality of sound and picture. I finally watched it completely and only give it 2 stars for the basic plot which was only satisfactory."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Inside Man","review":"This film, set and filmed in Sweden, had the potentials to be a good cold war thriller. After all, they have some good actors, like Dennis Hopper. Unfortunately, the story is not that great and the pace is slow. It's not an awful movie but it's also not as entertaining as it could have been. Nice to see Gösta Ekman and Dennis Hopper together, and Lena Endre, who has since become one of Sweden's most famous actresses, made her film debut in this one.The movie is something of a curiousity piece and even though I didn't think it was very good, I'm glad I have seen it, and there are cheap DVD editions, so if you're curious about it, go ahead and spend five or six dollars on it, but don't expect too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post of Honour","review":"Another wonderful segment of the Craddock family saga with historical references of the industrial accomplishments and the rights of man."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"Fascinating family saga (1st of a trilogy) covering the massive cultural, social, and economic changes in rural England in the period from the end of the Boer War through WWI.

But the quality of the product is very good. After very light use for a few days, many of the magnets have come loose and the plastic casing has broke. The concept of the toy is good but the quality if very poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I had the honor of previewing this book before it came out. It has great information. The little skits help bring home key points. Eva Rosenberg has a way of making even the most complicated tax information understandable. I think what I liked most is that she didn't offer any outrageous schemes to break the law undetected. Instead, Rosenberg gives readers the scoop on what deductions can be taken legally, how to stay clear of audits, and how to keep good records should you get audited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid advice","review":"Excellent primer for new business and reference for those a few years in. I found it covered most topics of interest except state taxes, which in the DC/MD/VA area is still a mystery to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Oringals!","review":"Beware: These are not the original hit or album versions of these songs.

Still, I love these pants. =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickies girl pinstripe","review":"I absolutly LOVE these pants. They got here quick, they fit perfect, my boyfriend loves how they look on me.

The pinstripes are really slimming, they totally make you look skinnier, and I get compliments on them everywhere I go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy has a basic design flaw","review":"We bought this toy for our 2 year old who loves to play with her toy kitchen. This is a basic fun toy - all kids love to take things in and out of something at this age.However, this toy has a basic design flaw and we ended up tossing it out after just 3 days.The basket holds onto the base with a very flimsy amount of plastic that sort of latches on the bar across the back of the base. This plastic makes a simple hook that is relatively easy for young kids to take on/off but it doesn't have nearly enough material to last. My daughter pushed down on the basket once and the plastic cracked and the backet then hung down. Then we tossed it and were very dissapointed.Hope this helps you pick a better quality toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying.","review":"Kids will like... for as long as it lasts. And it won't last long. I also found the way the basket attaches to the wheel base to become a cart annoying. The darn thing falls off all the time and eventually I threw it out. It just frustrated the kids at church nursery. Better off seeking a sturdier option. Even for a household with just one kid -- this thing is flimsy. It def. won't work for a situation where many kids will be using it (church nursery, preschool, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT TWIST!!!!!","review":"Great silent adaptation of Oliver Twist. The DVD from Image is the best available and also includes The Light of Faith. Oliver Twist has been restored as best as possible and is a joy to watch. The intertitles and main title were reset when this film was restored in the 1970's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The shower head leaked when I first installed it. An extra washer between the filter holder and the hose fixed that. After six months or so, the pressure seemed low so I replace the filter. As I disassembled it, I noticed hairline cracks in the head. When I screwed it back on after changing the filter, the cracks had grown enough to generate a small stream of water. New Market Naturals cheerfully replaced the head under warranty, but the second one suffered from the same problem after six months or so. If you buy this product, plan to replace the head every time you replace the filter. You'll also need to replace the washers, not a big deal but still a pain because they're not included with the filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont' waste your $$$...breaks within 6 months!","review":"We bought this showerhead so it could help our skin and my dd's eczema.

This \\"dictionary\\" does not have an ounce of objectivity in it. The author frequently substitutes his opinion of an idea for the definition of it.Also, given the price, I expected a bigger book. It's not very large, though admittedly it has had most of the terms I wanted to look up in it.If I knew of a better dictionary for politics I would recommend it; since I don't, I simply recommend not wasting your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating conversations about Orthodoxy","review":"As one currently exploring the Orthodox Church, this is perhaps the best book on Orthodox spirituality that I have read so far, and I and my wife have read several in the past few months. If this book is faithful and accurate in terms of setting forth the spiritual exercises and theology of Orthodox monks and what Orthodox Christianity is all about, then this book is must reading for all Christians - Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox. (I must leave it to persons well-versed on Orthodox Christianity to judge the book's accuracy and faithfulness, but my 5 stars are based on the assumption that it is faithful and accurate.) Even if one disagrees with the Orthodox goal of Theosis = divinization = union with God, this book will nourish one spiritually because of the many truths it teaches about Christianity and spiritual growth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong, very wrong!","review":"I started to read just the introduction and I started to sense that something was wrong, very wrong. Besides the assumption of eco-feminism as compatible with Orthodoxy, he discusses the occult he was deeply involved with in terms that made me more than uncomfortable: admiration, an ambassador's tone in describing occult matters, almost reminiscent of patriotism. This is the sort of thing one should speak of out of deep humility spurred by repentance from serious sin.This is the first time I have purchased a book that I thought was Orthodox theology and didn't get past the introduction before regretting I'd made the purchase.If you wonder, \\"Does this critic have anything better to say?\\" then <a href=\\"http://www.amazon.com/author/cjshayward\\">I invite you to visit my own author's section.</a>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cmpared to the Magus of Strovolos","review":"This book is not a total loss, but lacks in search for orthodox spirituality. The author turned preacher became an accepted pupil by the master. And then the breakup with the master. Ever since this author is flapping around in the wind, trying to recapture his original momentum with the Magus. He has flipped from researcher into an idiot in my eyes. But read it if you want to waste your time.

The author, having been educated in the United States, had followed the path of many of his contemporaries and participated in zen meditation and other new-age spiritual movements in the West. On a whim he decides to re-examine Christianity, traveling to a remote corner of Greece and discovering an ancient Christian tradition unknown to the western Christians of today. Within this tradition, guided by enlightended spiritual elders, he discovers the practices required to achieve 'Theosis', or union with God. Containing a wealth of miraculous and inspiring stories, Kyriacos Markides investigates this Way of the Saints, what he calls - The threefold way."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Mountaion of Silence\\" by Kyriacos Merkides","review":"The book is informative, historically correct, and keeps the reader wanting to read more.

The author asks questions of the monks that any lay person would ask, and he can be quite persistent! So, the structure of the book helped me feel invested in it from the beginning. And then what the monks (particularly Fr. Maximos) say is just amazing, inspiring, and life changing. I am so glad I read this book, and so glad I purchased it because I want to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"France","review":"Great!

Now, my younger son is hooked on it and my older one is enjoying it again two years later. The songs are catchy and both my sons learned them quickly and started singing them in the car. There are certain areas that both my sons found uninteresting, but over time, those areas have changed and they eventually like every scene. The meatball at the end almost squishing Elmo caused a little apprehension for both my son's at first, but the overall excitement and happy ending makes them giddy). There is a little bit of everything in this video including different styles of music, puns, counting, teasing and just plain silliness. Sesame Street delivers a great product once again and even improved on the first Kids Favorite Songs video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a little time to get use to","review":"My daughter liked Kids Favorite Songs that when I saw the second one I bought it for her right away. I didn't like it at first (I watch them with her) and she didn't take to it too quickly, but she got a little older and now she loves it. She sings the songs and she likes seeing the other kids. Personally I think there is a little too much talking."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 18 month old loves this video!","review":"I bought this DVD for my daughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it. When I ask if she'd like to watch the Elmo movie she starts dancing around and giggling. Her favorite part is Snuffy singing \\"On Top of Spaghetti\\" and when the meatball falls off the plate she throws her hands in the air and yells, \\"oh no!\\" And then she starts \\"sneezing\\". She does loose interest somewhere in the middle but it provides me with a great distraction for her while I make dinner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted to hate it but we love it","review":"My 19 month old son absolutely adores this video. I think what he likes about it are the children talking in language that is easy for him to understand...and of course, since he loves Elmo, he loves the fact that Elmo is his guide throughout the whole thing.Yes, there are some annoying moments...especially the precocious little one who says about Jack and Jill \\"they were probably British\\" and the same little girl who interrupts \\"Ants go Marching\\" by reminding us that \\"ants don't have thumbs\\".But all in all, it's fun time for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad...not bad at all!!","review":"My 27 mth old was not too interested the first time I put this DVD on, probably b'cos I had broken the usual routine of putting Fav. Songs 1. But after a few weeks & till now (it's been about 4-5 months) he really loves it. He likes the actions of the kids in the interviewing segment & does a very good job of imitating them. He is right on when identifying the next song to \\"act\\" out in the segments. Compared to Fav. Songs 1, there is more emphasis on real kid's opinions & what they think some of the song's words mean....older kids may enjoy that. Initially my son didn't like the \\"non-musical\\" parts but since he's starting to talk / communicate verbally, he shows much interest. Songs are good & known......personally I would say a good buy. If yr kids liked Fav. Songs 1, they will gradually enjoy this one (if not more)."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"My 3 year old son loves Elmo, and since I think Elmo videos are very educational (even though my husband CANNOT stand Elmo!),we own many Elmo DVDs, but I am extremely disappointed in this one.

There is a giant run away meatball from the \\"on top of spaghetti\\" song that appears thoughtout the show which scares him so much he doesn't even want his little sister to watch it. I'll admit this is probably an extreme reaction but just wanted people to be aware that it could scare other kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing video","review":"This video focuses on children trying to sing their favorite songs. You don't see very many Sesame Street characters; it's mostly about other children. It lost my son's attention (14 months old) almost immediately.The first video (Kids' Favorite Songs) shows Sesame Street characters singing, and he loves this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"My grandbaby loves Elmo and this DVD is very entertaining & educational!

I had been deceived by that title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sesame Street Kids Favorite Songs 2","review":"I hated this video. The favorite songs #1 is great. My 9 month old daughter loves it. What a disapointment the second one was. They don't have enough of the Sesame Street characters in it. It's a lot of clips of kids talking and singing and bad cartoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"My daughter (15 months) really likes this video because she enjoys watching all the other kids sing and talk with the Sesame Street characters. Other reviews have said there's not enough Sesame Street and too many kids talking, but I think it's a good balance of both."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 month old LOVES this DVD.","review":"I love this DVD because my 10 month old loves it. We have to watch it at least two times in a row when we watch it (she fusses when it goes off, ha). She was familiar with a few of the songs, but now she hums and clap to all the songs. This is the only show that holds her attention since she enjoys watching kids. Sesame Street rocks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not engaging, obnoxious and loud","review":"Not enough Elmo and Sesame Street characters. It's mostly little kids singing and not very clearly so if you want to teach your little ones the songs it won't work. My kids didn't like it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom Hates It; Son Enjoys It","review":"We bought this DVD because our hard to please 2 year old absolutely loves the first one, Kid's Favorite Songs.Kid's Favorite Songs 2 consists of Elmo running around Sesame Street asking questions & recording kids talking about their favorite songs. Unlike the first, this DVD has a lot of cut scenes where children are talking about & singing parts of their favorite songs with no muppets in sight. The show then cuts into scenes where muppets sing the entire song the children were talking about. There is also a lot of cut scenes where strange cartoons are singing the songs instead of muppets.I enjoyed watching Kid's Favorite Songs with my son, but Kid's Favorite Songs 2? Not so much. If it were up to me entirely, I would rate this rather low, but my son seems to enjoy it for the most part & adores the parts where Elmo is present, & that's what's important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first one","review":"I was very disapppointed with this DVD. We loved the first Kid's Favorite Songs so we were really looking forward to the second one. They spent too much time interviewing little kids and too little time actually singing the songs.Don't waste your money on this one. I highly recommend Kids Favorite Songs (1), The Best of Elmo, and Do the Alphabet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only this DVD will get my daughters attention!!","review":"I have bought every single elmo video, barney video, teletubbies and etc... but this Kids Favorite Songs II was only one that caught her attention. It sings nursery rhymes and lullabies that I have been singing to her since she was born, so the songs are familiar to her and elmo actually interviews real children like herself. My daughter is 9 months old and she loves this video more than anything in the world. She won't even stop to look at me when I call her name sometimes (that's how much she's so interested watching these other children like herself on tv singing her favorite familiar songs). I highly recommend this video because it helps me everyday with settling her down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for Kids and family","review":"There was one scene in this dvd when puppet Rosita sung a lullabye to a little child. The tune seems pretty sad to my little one that she usually cry everytime she watches this part.I usually rent at blockbuster online now I went ahead and buy her own copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids' Favorite Songs 2","review":"I gave this a 4 star because it doesn't keep my child's attention as well as the other Sesame Street DVDs do. It has popular kid's songs instead of original Sesame Street songs. Also, there are lots of real people in it, instead of all Sesame Street characters. It's still good, but not as good as others."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I should have listened to the reviews on here, but I thought I would give it a chance since my daughter loves a lot of the songs. It would have been fine if it were just the muppets singing, but having the kids singing in the video is terrible. My daughter didn't like it and I can't blame her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cute DVD","review":"I purchased this after my 2 yr old son kept begging to watch it after we returned it to the library.

I was so thrilled to find out that there was a second edition, and bought it for Christmas. It is terrible. He could care less about this video.

Do not recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"As a mother of twins, this video saved me!!! It kept their attention to allow me to shower.

Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD! Extremely Entertaining!!!","review":"My two-year old grandson got hold of his original DVD and broke it while trying to get it out of the case. He calls it \\"Snuffy's Meatballs\\" because of the way Snuffy chases his runaway meatball throughout the DVD while singing the song \\"On Top of Spaghetti.\\" This DVD purchased was a replacement for the original that he broke. Needless to say, he is very careful with this one. Both the songs and skits are very entertaining!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Cover","review":"I bought this DVD for my toddler because he loves Grover more than any character on Sesame Street. I was disappointed that Grover nor Cookie Monster who were both on the cover were in film at all. Very misleading! Also a bit heavy on kids talking and singing their favorite songs not as much characters and muppets as there should be. Not very entertaining as far as Sesame Street DVDs go. Better spending your money on another title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably best left forgotten","review":"Jewish bildungsroman has little to recommend it besides its ethnic angle. Unremarkable prose (that has the feel of Dickens, two generations later).

But I am not certain that there is any authorial control behind these hiccups. Too long.

I enjoyed the fact that the book was not only a very interesting adventure, but also a fascinating account of changing class consciousness and socialization to a new society. Kahan's account of what is gained and what is given up in this process allowed me to understand my own ancestors at a deeper level. He writes well in a journalistic style and is constantly providing details about his present that help me to understand the meaning of what was going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Book Review","review":"This is a review meant solely for the audio version of the book. the book itself is very good and i was looking forward to hearing a reading of it as i am a big fan of audio books. i was disappointed to hear that it was just a simple text to speech made by a computer. this was not worth the money and i feel as though i have been taken advantage of. it sounds like a robot reading it and for the price if someone was going to be lazy and use a program they could have spent what i paid for one copy and gotten a realistic sounding program.

The affair takes up about 50-100 pages with references to it later in the book as well.There are good parts to this book. The very beginning is interesting, and one can find interesting material throughout the book. But at a certain point, the main character starts visiting women of ill repute and starts seducing married women. It was at this point that I started wondering, \\"What kind of person was Abe Cahan if he could write about such matters in such detail?

The volume level for all of the tracks is low and the sound is thin and tinny. I own another Universal Motown GOLD SERIES box by Martha and the Vandellas and it is re-mastered at 24 bit and the sound is amazing. It is because of the Vandellas collection that I purchased this Four Tops set and instead of getting a real winner, I get a gigantic loser. It is so true that you can't judge a book by it's cover. Now that I have spent my money on this CD I notice that all of the other Motown Gold series critiques on Amazon have 5 star ratings except for this one which has no ratings at all.

Only what story he is telling, I cannot say. For the entire book I couldn't grasp the flow or meaning of the story. Of course I could read for pages and understand the mood and the speaker.

So far it seems only a desire to render predictable, sophomoric on-line reviews in the Q&A catechism style of the Ithaca episode....And for you who just doesn't feel the five-star bravado which so many others wield in touting Ulysses, it's OK- you're still a good person- and actually more the 'Everyman' for whom Joyce (supposedly) had sympathy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst binding ever","review":"This is a fantastic novel...it is really beyond a novel and beyond reproach. The paperback Gabler edition, however, posesses what is quite possibly the most worthless and flimsy binding of any novel, great or small. If you read the entire book (a difficult task, but well worth it), it is guaranteed to crumble in your hands like the gilded pork kidney dome of new Bloomuselem. All that expensive German philology and bibliographic science bound with bubble-gum and rubber cement. I don't pretend to be fully apprised of the respective merits of the various editions (although I do understand that the original 1934 U.S edition was a pirated and notoriously erroneous text) but you might do well to consider the revised 1961 Ulysses(i.e. The Vintage Books and Modern Library text), over this, the scholarly standard, cursed with a nickel-dime spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Viking printing [Anemic Binding]","review":"The binding on the Viking edition is absolutely miserable.

Nowhere on the Amazon website (although I have now requested this change) does it say that this audiobook is ABRIDGED! The quality of the performances are so far outstanding, but it was disconcerting, to say the least, to be in the middle of Book I and suddenly be transported to Book IV. I purchased the audiobook to help me as I read through the book itself, so to that extent the audiobook abandoned me just when I needed it most, as Book III is rather arduous. It is still worth it to me since the only other audiobook is going for almost $150, and as I'm reading the book in its entirety I will not be limited to the abridged story. However, I was disappointed and wanted to give others a heads up."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the many Joy(ce)s of life","review":"Joyce through his language and characters reproduces the many complexities of life down to the subtlest of nuances.

As a book, it almost defies explanation, such is it's achievement, in that it seems to be a story a story of so very little, yet with the importance of Odyssean epic. It's hard to explain. The thing about Ulysses is that it's sheer inventiveness will capture you. Joyce not only places you in the scene via description, the very words he uses become the description themselves, in the shape and texture of them. The book is also a library of allusions, but they can be taken as they are, or decoded within the book itself. There has never been a book quite like it before or since, and it is absolutely essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the twentieth century's malaise. It addresses not only the development of Ireland, but the development of man, and predicts the trends of the next hundred years effectively."},{"rating":"2","title":"For his mere petulant tenacity, how else may one rate this?","review":"it is hard to imagine exactly what i think of this except for the fact that maybe precisely once more you forget but forget no forgivance that once around is more for twice but you grow with twice"},{"rating":"2","title":"yes I said yes I will Yes.","review":"Well, Ernest Hemingway thought that Ulysses was a \\"Goddam wonderful book\\" so who am I to disagree. And I don't. Thie is a very nice edition, well produced and has Odyssean titles to chapters in the Table of Contents, if not on the chapter headings.

Taking the plot of a classic work is not unique, the way it was executed in this book was. Ulysses doesn't explore any of the great secrets of life. It doesn't seek to take on some great social issue. It is just a great work of art. It is difficult to understand, but with such an ambitious work this is no surprise.

I doubt James Joyce would like his books as ebooks. Any more than Shakespeare, Ovid, Milton, Boethius, Sartre, Shelley, Kazantzakis or Tobias would. It's not an appropriate fit.

It puts me in mind of someone going to an art gallery full of atrocious modern art and faking that they liked it to show how sophisticated they are. The truth is this book stinks.For one thing it is vulgar, which, I hate to disappoint anyone, requires no talent at all. This is a talent any six year-old boy possesses. Is the wordplay clever?

I would also easily have to say that I have never read a book that was as incomprehensible as Ulysses. I really do not believe that one has to have cliffnotes or any type of 'helpers' to read and understand a book. Yet, I firmly believe that Ulysses should be accompanied by several texts explaining page by page what you just read. It was so disjointed and difficult to comprehend that I was beginning to question my sanity in even attempting to sift through it and find a plot.

Ulysses is like no other novel I have ever read. There is no plot to speak of, but you come out loving Mr.Bloom at the end of it. It's very hard to read at first, but helper books such as Don Gifford's Ulysses Annotated and Stuart Gilbert's book point out what techniques Joyce is using. I think Ulysses is like a cult classic - you either get hooked on to it, or you get turned off by the abstruseness.

I will reread it perhaps in 30 years and appreciate it more.

It reminds me of modern art, where a so called artist splashes paint on a canvas in ten minutes and then passes it off as a masterpiece.

If my grade hadn't depended on it, I would have put it down after ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readers Are Idiots","review":"I didn't think I'd be writing books reviews 30 years after leaving school. But... There is a certain class of author -- George Meredith was one of the first to express this viewpoint -- who has the opinion \\"if you can't figure out what this is all about in the first chapter, you are intellectually unworthy to read my book.\\" That is arrogance of the first order. Joyce, Faulkner (in some cases), and others of the \\"I'm too deep for you, dummy\\" school have massive good press from academics. Books like this keep them in tenure, one can devote a whole semester to explaining what is happening on Bloomsday. If you don't have to read this book, you shouldn't bother. Good books don't have to be 'literary', just have to be readable and make sense. There are of course good moments in Ulysses, especially if you have ever been to an Irish pub, but you really have to dig for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat Emptor: Buyer (of the Kindle edition) beware","review":"The electronification of James Joyce's Ulysses hasn't quite got it yet: this Kindle edition is full of typos and odd punctuation. If you're planning on reading Joyce, you'd be better off with the hard copies for now; with maybe a free e-edition on your Kindle to supplement it, for those times when you're standing in line at the grocery store and can't be bothered to carry around 2 pounds of excellent literary deadweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick a writing style","review":"I am currently reading the classics, I feel they are classics for a reason. Ulysses though was one of the most difficult books I've ever attempted. I forced myself to keep going. It didn't flow and was difficult to read because the writer kept changing styles.I just don't think it's worth reading and wish I hadn't bothered. I understood the book but just didn't enjoy it.

Hemingway did it a similar injustice--Ulysses deserves to be read, reread, and studied as infinitum. Joyce devoted eight years of hard work to it, and nothing like its stream-of-consciousness narrative has been seen since. Scholars take note--Faulkner never read this book!Space prevents me from gushing the way I would like to, but look for the passage in which Stephen Dedalus and Poldy Bloom are getting blasted in Dublin as a baby is being born above them, and Joyce's language begins with the Angleish of Beowulf and travels through time, touching downe with Chaucer and Sir Thomas Browne, among others. In truth, it's hard to believe that a single living human being actually sat down and created this out of nothing; to my poetic heart, it has always seemed as sacred and immutable as the sea or its stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ulysses [Annotated], in fact, not annotated","review":"I've just now downloaded this version (Ulysses [Annotated]), so I can't say how it compares to the other Kindle versions as far as missing text, or any of the other formatting complaints. I can say, it does not appear to be annotated. And indeed, if you go to the actual publisher's site (digireads.com) they do not list it as being such, nor do they mention annotation anywhere in the product description.I know Amazon probably has millions of product descriptions to sort through and try to make accurate. But I'd rather have a vague description than one with added details that prove purely erroneous.I also think their practice of automatically cross-referencing the reviews for different editions of the same book is incredibly unhelpful. Bottom line: this version does not appear to offer any immediately discernible advantages over the free version; save your $1.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition plagued by errors","review":"I went with the Penguin edition because it seemed to have the best reviews out of all the editions available. While I'm sure the paperback edition is fine, the Kindle version is an absolute mess.It looks like this edition was made using OCR and a scanner. Foremost among its problems is that the word \\"the\\" routinely appears as \\"die\\" or \\"lie\\". This happens about once per page throughout the entire book.The font size changes from paragraph to paragraph. Punctuation is often missing or wrong. Commas sometimes appear as the number \\"3\\" in a subscript or something else fun like that. The letter \\"l\\" is frequently replaced by the number \\"1\\" (these look very different on a Kindle).Line breaks appear where they shouldn't, and spaces are often missing between words.I've seen similar problems with other books on Kindle, though usually only for freebies. Since there are several free versions of this book available, I'd advise avoiding this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive, Unadulterated","review":"Compared to other editions of Ulysses, this one does not take the needless and mildly obnoxious liberties with the text that certain other editions have--no fancy typography and unnecessary section dividers to be found here. This is (thus far) the unchallenged, definitive edition, with helpfully numbered chapters and the corresponding Odyssey chapter titles in the table of contents. The introduction and forward, while in no way revelatory, are informative and interesting enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarks on the object, not the work itself","review":"Notwithstanding disputes on the editorial choices, the main reason to get this particular edition is the fact that the guide by Don Gifford makes reference to its line numbering. The Gifford book is an indispensable companion to Ulysses. However, the large format, relatively small print and miserable binding are deplorable. Once you get to Molly's monologue, you almost have to detach the pages one after the other.

I loved The Brothers Karamazov, the greatest work of the greatest novelist who ever lived. (5 stars) For sheer reading pleasure Crime and Punishment beats anything I have ever come across.(5 stars) I enjoyed War and Peace, though to me it was a bit dated and didactic and not nearly as convincing and satisfying as DQ, BK or CP. (4 stars)But for some reason after three tries I can't get past page 20 of Ulysses. I find it boring, mannered and well nigh incomprehensible. If it wasn't for the fact that so many learned people say it is a masterpiece I would say Joyce is a fraud. (I read Potrait of the Artist as a Young Man but didn't think it very enjoyable or profound.)Why is it that I can enjoy so many other classic novels yet find Ulysses so repulsive?"},{"rating":"1","title":"another terrible scan of a public domain book","review":"The really awful side effect of Kindle is that we are subjected to terrible editions. There's to business model, so the public domain books are only available as prepared by amateurs. In this edition the verse is missing, which ruins even the first chapter.

I have not read English poetry and therefore was lost for an earier 200 pages. Joyce's references to Parnell were interesting, as was the singular reference to U.S. Grant. Leopold Bloom is an example, I suppose, of the exception to the single mindedness of these Irish people. Dublin was a lovely city, however, clearly not diverse enough for Joyce. I liked this book for the exposure given me to the English language. Joyce was a master with the pen (as was Paul). Do I read Finnegan's Wake? How can I not?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joyce was the one true literary genius of the century.","review":"Only on my 3rd or 4th attempt did i settle down and finally read this book. I actually saw Joseph Strick's 1967 film recently and although only a fraction of the book makes it to the screen, i found it more informative than any 'guide' you care to buy to help you.The range of linguistic styles, the mindboggling clever plotting, the dazzling knowledge,the unbelievably human sexual passages and above all the spectacular humour are for me all the elements that make Ulysses the definitive vision of how words make up a story that can depict the our condition.All I can say is that I got to Ulysses having already worked my way through the later innovators of the century - Pynchon,Beckett, Gaddis,Coover,Burroughs etc etc and it turns out that almost everything they have said can be found in Ulysses, and Joyce is always more touching, more beautiful, and more anything-you-care-to-mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the annotations?","review":"Hello All,I selected this partially based on the statement that this edition was annotated and had images.

He was drunk most of the time he had put pen to paper and he threw so much of the text out that its suprising that most people hold this pretentious amateurish work as the greatest novel of the last one hundred years. The prose is vague, uninspiring and chatoic, there is no plot line what-so-ever, it's just a meandering stream of undelicate and unsophisticated garble from a minor artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obfuscation incarnate!","review":"I had to read this (years ago) because I took English as a minor when I was an undergraduate. I cringe at the memory and the heated discussion I had with the professor (a Joyce fanatic). Now as a librarian I decided to give it another attmept, trying to keep an open mind. I have to give Joyce points for being clever and kudos for verbosity. After struggling through it again, I had to ask myself what was the point? Most of the book strikes me as an attempt by the author to show how very clever he was with word play and analogy and practically every other literary devise under the sun.To me as a reader, literature requires something more than an exercise in erudition or diction. I may be in a distinct minority here, but I still dislike Joyce for inflicting such a circus upon readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended on iPhone","review":"Its a classic literature.

Typically, this novel is a university favourite as there is so much to discuss, unravel and admire.I don't see how anybody can say that Ulysses is their favourite read. Like all of Joyce's works it is not particularly warm and, for me, wasn't a work to inspire and enflame the spirit. As you all know, or should know, Ulysses is the most important fictional text of the 20th century and that in itself makes it worthwhile to the patient reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh I Need To Review This One","review":"Althought I already had one....Yes!

The reason i liked Joyce's previous work is that both are not too long, he was a good writer and i am against the catholic church so any book that critizes it is okay with me. With his other books you really did not mind the parts when nothing really happens and his heavy prose style. But trying to read Ulysses is such a chore you end up scratching your head and having to read passages over and over again untill you get it.

Without a plot, it's just a bunch of random thoughts thrown at the wall, which is what this giant pile of excrement truly is. Don't buy the hype, I've read dozens and dozens of books deemed 'classic' and I found most to be labeled so for good reason. James Joyce is NOT a great writer, and this proves it. Awful, just awful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of your time","review":"Considered such a masterpiece - I HAD to read it. What a waste of time...First - the language: extremely difficult and archaic. Even for English speaking people. Can one enjoy a book if one needs a dictionary every couple of lines ?Then the allegedly 'cultural' riddles Joyce planted in the book for the sole purpose of torturing generations of English literature students and their teachers. Ask yourself - are you going to enjoy a book that neccesitates your literature teacher lie next to you and explain its 'sophistication' to you ? Every other page ?Then the foreign languages quotes in latin, german, irish, italian and who knows what else...Did Joyce expect his readers to be THAT fluent in other dialects ?Personally - I think Joyce wrote the book being completely drunk. Or worse.Last but not least - the story, the time frame and the main characters - boring, boring and then boring again.Your reading time could be used on much more pleasant, interesting books. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little for too much","review":"Clearly, Joyce's work is a tour de force, an everyman's epic day hidden in grand literary style. The langauge varies from beautiful to impenetrable, with allusions galore. The themes were shocking in 1922, and portrayed in all of life's gory detail. But is it worth it?The time involved in reading (let alone understanding) this book is enormous, easily on the order of fifty hours. What does this steep admission price buy? Simply put, not enough. Their are a multitude of insights one can draw from Bloom's day, but their are none that aren't easier to gleen from other writings. The language, while beautiful at times, does not justify the investment, in my opinion. For a passionate lover of English langauge and literature, this book may be for you. But for the everyday reader, who reads for simpler pleasures and knowledge, you will probably get little out of this book but the right to say 'Yes, I have read Ulysses, Yes!'"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Virginia Woolf","review":"Woolf was right. Joyce was obsessed with being, hm, obscure. I have read every book he wrote (not that many) and studied him at length. It has not helped. I cannot admire anyone who thinks we should have to work so hard to figure out what he was talking about. Normal people can't enjoy Joyce and I think this is a travesty. For all the hard work I had to do to figure out what he was talking about, I did not get one moment's enjoyment. Down with pretentious male modernists who feel we should all spend our lives \\"working\\" to unveil the \\"true meaning\\" in their words. For all you Joyceans out there who like to mock the \\"commoners\\" for not \\"getting\\" Joyce, I am working on a PhD in English--and I \\"get\\" him just fine, thank you.

No other book I know of has more power to inspire or instill creative thought. His symbolism and skill is simply astounding. Anthony Burgess once said that many times he'd think of Ulysses and then think about his own work, \\"Why bother?\\" I know what he meant, but the power of the characters and style gives everday writers like myself something to strive for.

The company appears to have done a poor job copy editing the final Kindle text. There are a number of typographical errors.

In a class I taught, many students' books contained a considerable misprint in which 15 pages of episode 13 are reprinted in episode 14 (and 15 pages are missing from episode 14). The binding on recent printings is so poorly constructed, that within 4 weeks of class, 3/4 of my class's editions fell apart into a dozen clumps of roughly 50 pages each. We contacted the publisher, but Vintage customer service was indifferent to our problems. My own copy, from 1986, is still in one piece after years of use. If you want this edition (which I still recommend), try an older printing. Vintage's indifference to its own shoddy book production is unprofessional and inexcuasble.

One thing is for certain - it is a difficult,long read. It is also, strangely, very hard to put down and it leaves you searching for meaning and just in a state of complete wonder. Amazingly, Joyce is able to convey each character's thoughts and dialect in a way that has never been achieved by anyone else. It feels almost as if each character was composed by a different author - they are so unique and detailed. Though I cannot express much of anything that has not already been said - let me make one recommendation to the reader of Ulysses - read something to help you through it (even cliff notes) and also read the Odyssey again - you will find this very helpful in navigating through this remarkable text."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Five sank cinco","review":"Just wanted my five stars to count..ive read about 1/3 of it REALLY IN DEPTH and i mean..its probably not for you (a la mark z danielewski + also a la literary joycean snobbery).

Its kind of what Eco tries to do, bringing together semiotics with detective stories, but joyce's scope is much more wide. incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise...","review":"Richard Ellman in his biography of the famous Dublin-born sponge, points out that Joyce was once asked why he was taking 12 years to write what would become Ulysses. Joyce was living in Europe, hitting up friends, relatives, and would be patrons for money as he masturbated away his talent right in front of the poor, half-wit woman he married. \\"Because,\\" he answered, \\"I can't think of anything else to do.\\" That about sums up why this book in truth is an eruption of verbal flatulence, a screech in the literary void by a man who was not capable of doing what lesser writers could: compose a plot. There are scenes, passages and conversations from Ulysses that are truly brilliant--but that's all one can say about it. The tragedy is that a man of such talent, who would have secured a place in literary history if he had never written another word after \\"The Dead\\", felt obliged to labor his way through this doorstop of a novel, when he could have produced something so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to delete this ebook as it is missing text.","review":"I was excited to see this as a free Kindle download.

Yes, the book is a worthy literary endeavor. But for those who are not brutally devoted to the endless pursuit of mind-numbing genius, ULYSSES is tiresome, tedious, and passe. The appeal of reading the mind wanderings of a pasty, weak pseudo-intellectual grows stale after the first dozen pages. For those enterprising readers such as myself who feel guilty dumping a Joyce work after only a chapter, read on. It gets worse. Confession: the genius mind-maze that is Joyce is sometimes just not worth exploring. One would have better luck escaping the Minotaur than successfully exiting this lingual labyrinth.

Nevertheless, with the assistance of a Cliff Notes edition I was able to go through the whole length of the book and actually understand what was going on. In all, it wasn't too bad.

Yes, it's one of the most entertaining books I've ever read. Every character is made real; the only heroes are heroes in the simplest ways. We see into each character's mind in the most accurate depiction of the internal world ever written. It's chaos, but it's a chaos that is made sensible through the real eyes of a group of very real characters, all living their basically simple lives as heroically and humanly and mortally possible. They are people, they have flaws, they are real, part of our real world. It's an untouchable work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Edition","review":"This rating reflects the quality of the edition, not the work itself.

Unfortunately, too many academics were entranced by occasional flourishes of vivid imagery to see this sham for what it was (and is): An intense act of laziness and hubris by a writer who had trouble telling stories. I think of _Ulysses_ as the precursor to all the self-indulgent pseudo-intellectual garbage that turned so many people off from reading \\"great literature\\" over the last 60 some odd years. However, the greatest tragedy comes from the fact that Joyce had talent in spades and showed it on occasion, such as with many of his short stories. If he would have tried to make _Ulysses_ even semi-comprehensible, it may indeed have been as great as some make it out to be. In the end, though, it's all just gibberish without a story to drive it."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again","review":"I requested Ulises, Spanish version, which was advertised.Instead, I got an old English version for the price of the Spanish one.I contacted the seller and s/he never had the courtesy of getting back to me.

I'm all for challenging reads, but not for gibberish which academics persist in labeling erudition. I find absolutely nothing redeeming about this book, but those who enjoy taxing their brains to ridiculous measures; drawing (more than likely inaccurate) conclusions from an incomprehensible conglomeration of words; and imposing meaning where none exists because few things in the text will limit whatever perspective they want to take are welcome to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a horrible book","review":"I'm an avid reader, who almost always finishes a book no matter how long or badly written but this one, I decided life was to short. This book is extremely dull!!! My book club decided to read this book after one of the members visited the James Joyce tower in Ireland, which the author supposedly wrote part of the book in. We also had noted that the book was on top 100 books of the century etc.. All of us decided the only reason this book could be recommended is because Joyce introduced a new form of writing called \\"stream of consisiousness\\". This style of writing basically goes into the character's mind and portray's his/her thoughts. This style at least in this book is very very had to follow, if no narrative is given in between characters thoughts by the author. But to top it all off, the book is boring to say the least, we decided unanimously to stop reading the book and some of us had already read 1/2 the book, myself included by sheer doggedness."},{"rating":"2","title":"FILM GOGGLES","review":"This intense, hysterical, loud, sweet and sour film was NOT an IMPROVISATION despite the end title!

Somehow, despite arriving in sealed packages, the chips seemed to be dusty/dirty. The lining in the case that holds the chips is some kind of cheap fuzzy plastic. When mine arrived, one of the plastic slots for the poker chips was all crumpled up and the chips were just sitting in the space between the plastic and the wooden interior of the case. As for the cards, they somehow managed to find the absolute worst decks of cards that I've ever seen. I didn't think that they even made cards that bad. If you do buy this poker set, do yourself a favor and buy some real cards along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy in store!","review":"i highly suggest that you buy poker chips in store so you can easily touch the chip and examine the quality. poker chips are all about the feel in your hand. you can't determine that from a picture from the internet, they all look similar but can feel lousy once you pick one up. also, it's easier to return to a store than internet. these chip sets are heavy & expensive to ship.please note; heavier poker chips feel better. 11.5g is the minimum weight to buy. although, i suggest you get 13.5g or 14g chips. good luck on your game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product arrived damaged","review":"Purchased the set for a family member as a Christmas gift.

These are no where near the quality of my others. Nearly every single chip has a flaw. The colors are dull. The white chips look like they have dirt in them and are yellowed. The stamped dice imprints are not aligned. Many of the chips have sharp edges and do not stack evenly, some have flattened sides. Some chips have a rough texture and the color is all splotchy.

The case is made to look expensive but it in fact very flimsy, I've had to superglue it already. The chips are nice but the decks it came with are crap (not that it matters that much, you have to switch out decks pretty often if you're playing weekly poker). You can what you paid for (for $40-some dollars my expectations weren't THAT high). I really enjoy the black under cards (to stop from showing the bottom of the deck), those were a great addition that I never even thought of.Beyond that, I'd say these are good for the value, it's a great set to have at home if you don't have to move the case around too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken case","review":"I should have listened to the other reviews but thought I would get lucky. Unfortunately I did not... my case was cracked when I took it out of the box. The packaging looked good so I do not understand why it was broken other than maybe it was not taken care of during shipment. In any case (not a pun), the quality of the case is very cheap and since it was broken it revealed being made of cardboard covered with metal paper. It is obvious that the case would not have lasted that long if it was used at all. Also there is only one handle so the weight of the chips alone would start cracking the entire case.Fortunately nothing inside was damaged from what I case see, though it is obvious the quality inside the case was just as bad.

I spoke with a rep and ordered a replacement set on the condition that the set be examined before shipping. I was reassured this would happen. The replacement set arrived and was so bad that the first set looked good by comparison! Again, Amazon was easy about the return but never once offered any suggestion as to what I might buy instead, and offered no 'free shipping' as I had had on my original orders.

I just did two trays, with 2 cups of seed per tray, soaked and then germinated for 3 days in the dark. I had good thick trays of grass, and most importantly it was so deliciously sweet! This was my first time growing wheat grass and it smelled so strong and bitter when I juiced it-- I was concerned, thinking it would taste awful. But it was so sweet to the taste. I was later told by an old pro that some say the sweetness is due to the seed, which brings me back to why I sought out this seller again.

In Tolkien, Bilbo and Frodo were the Ring-bearers; in this novel, the pig was the Key-bearer. And in Tolkien, Gandalf rode a fast horse known as Shadowfax; in this novel there was an almost identical character with a very similar name also. There were several other times while reading it that I found parallels too close to Tolkien to be merely coincidental. But enough about that. As a whole, the novel was very shallow and predictable.

Ever since I first saw her on BTVS I have always been a big Alyson Hannigan fan, it is rare to see an actress that can handle both sensitive dramatic scenes AND have a great sense of comic timing, neither of which are evident here, I really would like to see her mix in a few more dramatic roles like she did in \\"Beyond the city limits\\" (A Very underrated film!!!) but one more horrible disaster like this and the great career boost she got from doing BTVS and the American Pie films will have gone right down the tubes. What was her agent thinking even showing her this project??? Will some director PLEASE save Alyson Hannigan and offer her a great dramatic role to save her career!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't get that part of my life back","review":"Like the previous one star post stated, you can't spoof comedy.

It's gone.From what I did see, was 30 min of continual parody's, so much so, that I really had no idea that there was actually a plot.

The jokes are just stupid, I didn't laugh a single time during the first 30 minutes. Don't ask me about the rest of the film, to prevent permament brain damage I had to abort after half an hour.I quickly went though the rest of the film looking for some nudity, but nothing there to see. If you want to see more of Sophie Monk, \\"Sex and Death 101\\" should do the trick...Conclusion: Do yourself a favour and do NOT buy (or even watch) this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rental!","review":"A good laugh, but only if you have seen a lot of \\"date movies\\" - which is the only true way to see the humor in this movie.

I just wanna warn you: this a turkey, a real turkey..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, just gross","review":"This has to be the worst movie i have ever seen! I dont mind if they parodied other films, but all they do is take the exact scene from them and just make them stupider. Atleast they put a twist on them in the Scary Movie series. Aside from that, the whole moivie is NOT FUNNY AT ALL, just gross/stupid.In conclusion,this sucks. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the creators a parodie movies;","review":"Exaggeration do NOT make funny movie moments.

There are spoofs on Bridget Jones' Diary, Meet the Parents, Sweet Home Alabama, etc., but the spoofs are simply NOT FUNNY! Sometimes the spoofs are so gross (e.g. man chewing on another man's chest hair) that you want to puke, not laugh.I actually liked Scary Movie and some of its sequels, and decided to give this movie a try. Big mistake!Stupidity doesn't get any lower. This DVD isn't worth a penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time. . .","review":"I've alread wasted an hour and a half of my life watching this movie. And beleive me that's time I'd like to have back. It pains me to have to spend anymore time dwelling on this drivel.There are two major problems with this film. First and foremost it's not funny. Maybe I missed an e-mail or a memo or something but I thought comedies were supposed to be funny. And secondly why is this movie \\" unrated \\". I saw nothing in here that wouldn't have been above a PG-13. My only guess is that without \\" unrated \\" plastered on the cover it wouldn't have appealed to such a wide audience.The four writers who had nothing to do with this movie have to be some of the smartest people in the world. So if you're eyeing this movie in the rental store, my only advice to you is to slowly back away and move on to the next movie on your list. Do that and you'll be lucky enough to be considered in the same breath as those four writers...some of the smartest people in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny, but too much bathroom humor","review":"I saw this DVD at a friend's house a few weeks ago.While Alyson Hannigan was a great actress, the movie relied TOO MUCH on bathroom humor. I enjoyed the comedic scenes and the allusions to other movies, but the gross factor in several skits seemed excessive. In addition, while there was great humor, the movie seemed too much like its predeccesor, the \\"Scary Movie\\" series. If you truly want vomit-producing humor, get this. Otherwise, there are better comedies available."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this, but it just isn't happening","review":"Let me first say I love Alyson Hannigan. I really wanted to like this movie given this is her first major movie role.But alas, this movie is crap. With the exception of a few chuckles here and there, this is something to watch while you're websurfing or talking on the phone - giving it your full attention is not only unnecessary but almost painful. The jokes are bad, predictable, and worst of all, not funny.If you have any interest in this movie I strongly recommend you RENT IT first before you spend money on it.I can only hope that Alyson's next movie is of higher caliber. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE IT SO MUCH, NOT EVEN FUNNY","review":"I hate this film so much I can't even explain it.

The humor is pretty frequent, gross and intense all the way through. However, I have to disagree with the people who say the movie didn't tell a story. Maybe it's not a GOOD story, but a story is clearly there and understandable.You could easily follow along to the story, and the actual storyline segments were located at just the right moments, so it's not like the entire film was just one disgusting joke after another. There's a story there, and you don't have to look hard for it either.I think the diarrhea cat on the toilet was the best joke.If you like this movie, check out Not Another Teen Movie for more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Wow, one of the worst movies we've rented in a long time. Weak spoofs, bad acting and multiple scenes that left you going WHAT?I can't tell you how often I was confused by some scenes that ended in a really bad placed joke that so disrupted the already weak thread of the plot.This movie stank, the spoofs stank, the writing and acting stank.

I would have rated this lower but there is no rating below 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wish I did not see this movie.","review":"After I saw the first two \\"Scary Movies\\" I decided too see this movie. I thought the Wayans brothers were the two writers, but I can see that I was wrong. This movie is a spoof with no plot and no good jokes.

It wasn't funny at all and the storyline was kind off dumb.It was about a heavyset woman who wants to be beautiful. So she does this thing like Pimp My Ride, but instead of cars, they do you. So she becomes beautiful and meets this guy and it shows how they get married and this whole comedy-supposed to be romantic story.The part i did like is they take parts from alot of movies. Probably about a good 16-20 movies, but it wasn't that great. Scary Movie fans, you WILL be disappointed. See it, if you dare."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it was short","review":"Really, I don't even want to go in depth and pick the movie apart. It isn't worth my time, and I'm just doing a review to save some of you people from spending movie on a terrible movie. The plot was dumb (and not in a good kind of way with spoof movies).Two main problems:1--a parody was thrown in that had NOTHING to do with the style of movie (ex:Kill Bill)2--a parody which was \\"date\\" movie related was put in just for the sake of adding something in without working it in the proper way becasue the writers couldn't think of an idea or were jsut plain lazyIt's kind of hard for me to word, but hopefully people will get what I'm saying and spend their money elsewhere ...the only positive thing is this movie was short (1 hour and 13 minutes), and I really couldn't wait for it to end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars if I could.

Otherwise, this is a movie that suffers from \\"Family Guy\\" disease; the writers think that a random reference to another movie or TV show is the same thing as a joke. So they have an actress re-enact the Paris Hilton hamburger commerical; or stick Hannigan in Uma Thurman's yellow \\"Kill Bill\\" track suit and give her a sword to wave around. And then they don't try to be clever or put a funny spin on these; they just hope the 13-year-old boys in the audience will recognize the reference and think that's enough. One hopes that better filmmakers will see Hannigan's star power and put her in funnier movies, so we can all just forget about this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really really embarrassingly bad","review":"Watching this made me feel so bad for the actors. You can tell the actors have a lot of talent but the script is so awful, there wasn't much they could do. I love spoof movies but I didn't laugh once at this movie. It was so bad I had to bail out, couldn't watch the whole thing. How did Hollywood greenlight this movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jokes actually made me angry","review":"Comedy is a very delicate art. Timing is essential. If you make a film with a series of parodies and one-liners, if the first five jokes/parodies don't work, that sets up the viewer to pre-judge the rest of the movie negatively. That is what we have here. During the parody of The Bachelor (ABC-TV reality show) where the women are blown away with a shotgun by a bachelor with a satisfied grin, it just made the rest of the politically incorrect and tasteless jokes even more offensive.I actually feel sorry for, and pity, people who love this film. I would bet these people have criminal records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny at all..it's awful jsut awful","review":"Bad as bad gets. The film is not funny at all not one bit funny not at all. The film iss o bad you wanna shut it off from the first bad joke to the next. I dont know how I made it through the whole film. The jokes are lame and not funny there so bad your laughing becosue the movie is terrable. Overall one of 2006 worse movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unfunny, unoriginal spoof of romantic comedies","review":"Date Movie has some funny moments. But they are the kind of funny moments where you are almost embarrassed to find yourself laughing at these completely retarded, senseless jokes that should only be funny to those around the age of 10. The reason that Date Movie really doesn't work is the fact that a lot of the movies that it spoofs are already comedies. Therefore, all the funny moments are basically just retreads of the funny parts of actual good comedies released over the past few years. If you wanna know the basic trend of the jokes in Date Movie, go rent your favorite romantic comedy, and imagine all the jokes in that movie if they were blatantly sexualized or made so unimaginably disgusting that even I could barely handle what I was watching. There is no redeeming quality or character to Date Movie. The movie has about 4 or 5 funny moments, and will be completely offensive to most of the people who decide to throw down 7 bucks to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie made me cry","review":"This movie was so bad that i cried because i had wasted some of my hard earned money too see it. To anyone over the age of 13 this movie probably wont be funny. I didnt laugh once during the whole movie. I found some of the jokes very gross (the cat on the toilet) and thought they were over done. Fine parody Meet the Focker by having a cat that can use the toilet but do we need to watch this cat using the toilet for what seemed like a whole minute. It just went on and on. If i could have given this movie 0 stars i would have. The best thing about this movie is that its short, usually i hate short movies but with this one i was very happy that it was over. If you really want to see it then rent it because your not going to want to watch it more then once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Very poor taste -- I actually thought it was going to be funny.

My wife and I walked out on this movie after 20 excruciating minutes of stupid, senseless, parodies. At least there was a loose plot to Another Teen Movie and the first three Scary Movies, but not this one. Most of the kids in attendance were teens and preteens, which was not good because of the terribly insensitive scenes like the dating couple beating the heck out of a street bum, or the male date inexplicably faking a female orgasm for no particular reason other than to make you think they might be making fun of When Harry Met Sally.Only trouble is that these gags hit zero on the humor meter. Do not waste your money on this trash other than renting it for sheer morbid curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow An Average Rating Of Two Stars.......That Tells You Something!","review":"I have to agree with the masses. This movie is a total bore. The repetitive spoofs back to back to back are oh so annoying. My attention drifted away from this garbage and I startd surfing the net.Not only were the jokes bad but they were gross and unpleasant and demeaning. Even Allsion Harrigan as a thin person was not too pleasing to view on the screen. And the scene where the couple roll a drunk like its the thing to do is so mean spirited.Avoid at all costs. The people have properly spoken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astoundingly bad","review":"Perhaps the worst mainstream, major studio release in the history of American movies. If it was 100 times better it might reach the \\"so-bad-it's-funny\\" level, but it is far worse than that. Too bad- Alyson Hannigan is hot and the reason I watched this. If she had performed the entire movie nude it still wouldn't be worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP! BACK AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE...(its for your own good)","review":"Date Movie? More like a horrible blind-date movie. Instead of buying this movie, go buy all of the movies that this one spoofed.

And well,it was pretty much what I expected it to be- a pointless stupid crude movie. I've seen 3 of the Scary Movies, and they aren't any better than date movie.

It's mostly about a girl who is overweight, until she is pimped out by the Pimp My Ride guys and becomes a beautiful, skinny woman. Then, she meets a man, and he meets her parents, who are crazily drunk all the time. She then comes across a sexy ex-girlfriend of his, who wants him so badly still. It's really hard to explain all of this on here, but that's basically the story. The movie spoofs such romantic comedies as Just Friends, Meet The Parents/Fockers, My Big Fat Greek Wedding, When Harry Met Sally, and My Best Friend's Wedding. Others include the television show Pimp My Ride, Kill Bill, and a sexy Paris Hilton commercial. The film overall is a hilarious spoof enjoyable for those who love a good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not deserving of two stars","review":"I'm going to keep this review short and sweet.

Yes, parodies can be funny, (Think Airplane! or Scary Movie) but when a studio stoops to pump out watered down trash like this it just ends up turning off people from an entire genre.

Sadly, there is nothing remotely funny about this film (unless you find the overly gross interpretation of Robert De Niro's toilet trained cat halfway hysterical, as I did). Instead of delivering solid comic timing and well thought out laughs, \`Date Movie' just tosses everything it can think of at you. Nothing sticks. There is no focus here, no developed plot; nothing but a hodgepodge of very unfunny sequences that don't mesh well at all. This is an incoherent mess."},{"rating":"1","title":".... ehh ...","review":"This movie was highly dissapointing.I did not have high expectations going into it (from what friends have told me) but I really wanted to watch it.

For an average cat weighing seven to 12 pounds, somewhere between 1 1/2 to 3 teaspoons of tea tree oil would be lethal. Because of this cats should never be treated with anything more than one to five drops of tea tree oil per teaspoon of carrier oil. The same thing applies to small, and some medium-sized dogs.Another reason to avoid using tea tree oil on small animals is that they tend to lick themselves and end up ingesting the oil.Most of the cat deaths from tea tree oil come from people using tea tree flea & tick treatments which are applied to the entire body of the cat. This product is applied only in the ear. Nonetheless, given the extreme toxicity of tea tree oil to cats, I would be very cautious. Is the ear wash so essential that it is worth risking your cat's life? Perhaps try another product first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Was using Oti-clens from the vet and looked for something bigger and cheaper.

After about the 5th or 6th day, I thought it could be from the TheraTears. I stopped taking them and the next day or two my headaches were gone. I have since discontinued use altogether. Unfortunately, due to the side effects, I wasn't able to use the product very long to assess if it helped with my dry eye. During the short period of time I did use it, I did not see a difference.

Based on the other reviews here I began taking this supplement at the recommended dose of 3/day hoping that it would reduce the redness in my eyes. Prior to this I had been taking a single fish oil pill/day.While the redness of my eyes did appear visibly reduced over time, I began to experience a baffling side effect where, with my mouth wide open in mid-yawn, my jaw would suddenly and unpredictably \\"lock\\" open. I had to push and prod the side of my jaw for minutes at a time before things would pop back into realignment and I could close my mouth. For a couple of weeks I had no idea what was happening and was about to go see a doctor before I put two and two together.

The thing is, there is also enough new and valuable content here to make this another \\"must read\\" for copywriters.This book also very closely mirrors Peter Bowerman's Well-Fed Writer with much of the same content. That's not necessarily a bad thing and just adds confirmation to the advice being given.I wont begin to talk about what you might take away from this book.

Pierce needs to stick to Bond and stop pretending to be a serious actor.Any film which requires as a presupposition the audience having seen another film is stupid. A lot of the reviewers on here are saying things like \\"Well, it's really great if you are aware that Brosnan also plays James Bond.\\" What person went to see this steaming pile and is not aware of that? If you didn't know that it's surprising you had the mental faculties to find the theater. And even when compared to the Bond character this movie still bites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete letdown","review":"I expected a film of at least some dramatic content with Geoffrey Rush alongside Brosnan, but sadly no.

If you want the \\"anti-007\\", view the quality of \\"The Prisoner\\" series.

This movie is so bad we took it out of our player after 40 minutes and threw it in the trash can. The characters are poorly developed, and flash backs don't add, just divert the viewer's attention.

It is a very bad movie. The dialog is muffled and hard to hear in parts, the plot very thin, acting mediocre.

This movie was listed with a 3-star (out of 4) rating, so I picked it to watch. I guess they would have given 3 stars to anything bashing American and British imperialism with its devilish plans against the proud people of Panama (which, if you don't know, is a Central American country, located where the canal is). There is absolutely nothing in this film to even partially redeem its incredibly silly premise. I first thought that the leading actor was James Woods, but it turned out to be another guy, what put the final nail in the coffin of my opinion. Save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fond of this movie","review":"My spouse and I stopped watching this film about one half way through it. For me, Brosnan, is never believeable in the characters that he plays. My wife liked him as Remington Steele but I could not stomach him. I thought he did his recent Robinson Crusoe role alright. Here in \\"Tailor\\" he seems to project the correct image here, but his character really is not likeable. Besides that, I can't figure out where this movie fails. If it was any good, I could also excuse the face of the tailor's \\"conscience\\" that periodically flashes on the screen and speaks.

Intensely layered with a very dry, dark, and often bizarre sense of humor, excellent direction and acting with Pierce Brosnan playing a real scumbag, if you know nothing of political history and backdoor manueverings, this film may make no sense to you, but if you feel comatose being subjected to standard Hollywood crap, you may have fun with this.

But the Tailor of Panama is such a film. The heavy dialogue drowns itself and its actors, who don't seem to try to tread water. Rush and Brosnan are broad charicatures which might work in another film, but not here. The films jokes and attempts at wit are labored and artificial. What the heck does \\"Casablanca without the heroes\\" mean? The beauty of Casablanca was that there were no perfect heroes in that movie, everyone had their dark side.

Ah, NO!","review":"How the name Casablanca has found its way into the reviews of this convoluted pile of dreck is bizzare, at best. This movie fails on every level. The plot is actually quite simple, but the script is written so poorly that much of story unfolds incomprehensibly.

The main thing that kills it is the pacing. It is REALLY, REALLY slow - almost painfully so because after sitting through it, you really want an ending that at least makes it worth all your suffering . . . and it never comes. Very bad movie. I strongly suggest passing this one over."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprisingly bad movie.","review":"The movie starts slowly as you wait for pierce brosnan to be more a part of the movie. Then Brosnan is truly a dispictable character (unless you love sociopath sex addicts) with the only good guys being the revolutionaries and the tailor. There are plenty of vulgar language and dialog, plus some T and A, so this one is for 18 year olds and up, or no one at all.In true left-wing Hollywood style, the bad guys win, and there are untrue references to President George Bush, \\"#41\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for what I was able to stay awake through........","review":"Ok, this isnt fair.

The plot line of Harry and Marta was not the unspoken love story of the book, and the ending in no way resembled LeCarre's tale. The verbally explosive scene at the tailor shop makes Harry the one who gets upset, rather than Mickey (via Harry's humiliation of him), giving Mickey's suicide a different motivation entirely. The episode where Harry moves Mickey's body and cleans up Mickey's apartment is left out. Louisa is given an alternate personality more suitable to Jamie Lee Curtis. Don't waste your time and money--read the book. Better yet, listen to The John LeCarre Collection audio.

I remember my family taping it when I was about 7, and I loved watching it. Needless to say, when the new DVD version was released I instantly snapped it up!The story is about a widowed Government official (Cary Grant) and his three unruly children. A chance meeting throws the beautiful Cinzia Zaccardi (lovely Sophia Loren) into their lives. Cinzia is the daughter of a prominent classical conductor, and is looking for a change of scene. When she decides to become the children's nanny, no-one is prepared for the hilarity and heartache that is to follow...This is indeed a lovely family film, with a few shades of \\"The Sound of Music\\". The new DVD version offers an average-looking transfer of the film, with a photo gallery and two trailers as the extras.Also starring Martha Hyer, Harry Guardino, Paul Petersen and Eduardo Cinanelli. (Single-sided, dual-layer disc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted that the pretty rich girl didn't win the guy","review":"Love the Italian influence. Grant and Loren, what a combination. My emotions ran high during the railroad scene. Loren is delightful in her songs, dance and child-like attitudes. She is very precious with the children. A must for the 50-60's collection of romantic comedies. PS Love the Houseboat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Loved this movie, romantic, fun, and child friendly. Who thought falling in love could be so much fun. Love Cary Grant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful classic.","review":"We enjoyed watching and remembering when movies were more about acting and not so much with all the special effects or political overtones. Look forward to finding and watching more classics like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slight, predictable romantic comedy","review":"A government official (Cary Grant) tries to reconnect with his children (Mimi Gibson, Paul Petersen, and Charles Herbert) after the death of his wife. The daughter of a symphony conductor (Sophia Loren) goes on the run to escape her overbearing father (Eduardo Ciannelli) and takes a job as nanny to the children. Romantic comedy ensues.If there is any reason to watch this film, it is the chemistry between Grant and Loren, who had been in a real life relationship not long before filming began. The situation, however, is highly contrived and the scriptwriters (Melville Shavelson and Jack Rose) are all too willing to cast all logic aside for the sake of some rather slight gags. Characters do not behave in a consistent fashion, their personalities changing as the script requires so that the story can hit every predictable plot point on the way to its happy ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, accurate, and detailed","review":"This incredible book is a gem. Filled with black and white illustrations from the period in question, the fashion plates, drawings, caricatures, and portraits help create a strong sense of the 19th century. This book follows the gradual changes and shows the overall shape of each chunk of time in the form of silhouettes (The author prefaces each section with a gray on white figure outlining the nature of that time's costume). While this book may be out of print, it is well worth the search if your passion is costume history through primary resources, particularly that of the 19th century. The approach is purely pictorial, but if what you want to know is the look, this book is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaaah!","review":"What an utterly terrible movie! What an odd look at marriage! What a waste of talent (Renee and Chris' talents are lost in this cinematic mess)! What a cheesy and predictable plot! What a terrible ending! What a waste of money! What a waste of time!!!Honestly, it doesn't get much worse than this. I admitt, cheesy and predictable can be fun (eg. \\"The Cutting Edge\\" \\"Never Been Kissed\\" or \\"Miss Congenialtiy\\"), but this movie misses all the marks. When it's not boring, it's just ridiculous.Try \\"Cricle of Friends\\" or \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" on for size instead. Really, you'll thank me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoughtless","review":"\\"The Bachelor\\" looks and feels like it was conceived, written, and filmed over a long-weekend, as if it were a rehearsal for a real movie. Watching this is absolutely exhausting, as the script limps along in mind-numbingly obvious directions. Overall the acting is poor, but is otherwise shackled by inane dialogue. I'm ashamed for not having found something better to with with the 90+ minutes this movie stole from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"This is first time I have been compelled to write a bad review, but frankly, this movie was bad. Don't get me wrong, there is nothing I love more than a romantic comedy. However, this was not romantic and not funny. I didn't expect an Academy Award winning movie, just a cute, entertaining, romantic comedy. It didn't deliver. The two stars have been great in everything I have seen them in, but this movie just did not work for them. I felt no chemistry between them, Chris O'Donnell just irritated me the entire movie, and the lines these actors were expected to deliver were horrible. I was embarrased watching this movie. I've read the previous reviews and I must say I'm interested in seeing the original so I can see what they could have done with this movie. Skip this one and see \\"Return to Me\\" when it comes out on DVD/Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing to write home about, but fun and zany.","review":"Ok, the premise of the movie is pretty canned, and some ideas/montages downright dumb or silly, but the overallpresentation is a bit out of the box and humorous. The moviemoves at a brisk pace, and uses and lambasts a lot of cliches about marriage. One would think the comedy would be predictable, but it manages to create an off-beat edge that tickles. Supporting characters, including the older actors,keep things diverse or outright wacky. Zellweger brings a pouting charm while O'Donnell is pure naivety and his fat side-kick delivers some good laughs. Again, the movie is a success on it's own terms because of the brisk pace that stays consistently outrageous and doesn't get stuck in any plodding emotional exposition, sentimentality, or melodrama. Fun flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good times !","review":"The Bachelor is a great movie! Especially for those women who think that their man will never commit. . .

Its a fun date movie but that's all, nothing special. I just felt that the whole movie was recycled and I'm one of those people that wants a little more originality to movies. Besides it reminds me of those cheesy reality tv shows that they have on tv. It just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"Other critics beat this movie down but I saw part of it on Comedy Central and was glad that others had given it bad reviews. It made the price lower. It wasn't as if the producer's were trying to re-create some great work of literature to film. I think they were trying to make a romantic funny movie that entertains and I think they hit their mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one should have a warning label...yikes!","review":"So, I saw the ad for this one and thought, Chris O'Denell as a loveable Bachelor, looks like fun...but was I ever in for a let down.

And on a side note, the depiction of 30-something women as gold-digging, husband-hungry, cometitive maniacs is rather bizzare."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING ORIGINAL","review":"This is just an extended version of The Three Stooges short \\"Brideless Groom\\" in which Shemp stood to inherit $500,000.00 if he got married within 7 hours.

This movie is so predictable that you already know how it is going to end after 15 minutes. I have to admit the first 10 minutes were endurable but after that... This movie is really very bad. The cast is uninspired and uncharismatic and the story is just a 13-in-a-dozen routine lovestory. An absolutely \\"no go\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost...","review":"The Bachelor is a movie with great intentions. The plot is cute, even though unrealistic. The actors are even good. However, that je ne sais quoi, the indescribable something, that all great movies have is missing from this film. I found myself during the comedic scenes wanting to laugh, but not finding any reason to do so. The touching scenes almost warmed my heart, but not quite. I wanted to like the movie, but I couldn't. The characters were unlikeable, however well acted. The only enjoyable part was Anne played by Renee Zellwegger and, unfortunately, too much of the movie was absent of her. Somewhere along the road to greatness, The Bachelor stopped at mediocrity. Trust me, this one isn't worth the trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this movie to be silly and at times irritating. It did have a few (very few) touching moments, and 1 or 2 chuckles but this is NOT a keeper. The film is blatant in its use of stereotypes (desperate women/weak men). It was hard to be sympathetic with Chris O'Donnell's character, when he was willing to throw away the \\"love of his life\\" for 100Million $, oh, wait, he was making the sacrifice for his employees. And why was everyone (especially the lawyer) so surprised by the amount of money in the estate?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you plan to sit through this, bring a good book.","review":"The story: a confirmed bachelor has a choice between marrying the pig he is currently dating or not.

He should have married them when he had the chance. He marries the pig.Funny. Ha. Ha. The only bit of amusement is a few minutes of Peter Ustinov as the uncle. Those who watch this will get what they deserve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"Chris O'Donnell certainly has the potential to be a great actor. He should not waste is time selling just his pretty face. The plot was non-existent and when it existed it was too transparrent.We love Renée Zellweger, her roll in Jerry Macquire was perfect. She had virtually no lines worth remembering. The best part of the film came when the Priest was speaking with O'Donnel on the lake near the Palace of Fine Arts. O'Donnell realized what love was, at least for him.One more point. Unless Renée Zellweger's character and that of her roommate were making more than $500,000 per year, they could not have afforded that appartment. I have been in that appartment, the rent was $5,500 per month and the condo was worth more than $1.5 million. You figure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless and Senseless","review":"I do not understand how anyone could have enjoyed this film. The acting was terrible, as was the story. It barely held my attention, and I also felt that it was demeaning to women, in that it portrayed women as stereotypical psycho's who will do anything to get married, and to get their hands on a man's money! Renee Zelwegger & Chris O'Donnell were both a waste this film.

Particularly when he sings \\"Home from the horizon\\", it is not out of tune. He has a great sounding voice, nice mellow tone.

Especially Australia or Doors of sleep. Nice, peacefull album. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Challenge Yes To Put Out A New Album As Great As This","review":"I am so sick and tired of people criticizing Steve Howe's vocals!Sure, when this album first came out in 1975, it took me a little while to get used to the vocals. Steve Howe does have an unusual voice. And I was only sixteen at the time.But I have long since come to appreciate this album and Steve Howe's vocals on it. In fact, I think his voice is haunting. And the song writing on this album is brilliant.I would much rather hear Steve Howe sing the sophisticated music that appears on this album than hear Jon Anderson sing the primitive music that appears on recent Yes albums such as \\"Magnification\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Howe's best solo album","review":"Steve Howe's second album takes what worked best from 1975's \\"Beginnings\\" and improves upon it. Those who don't care for Steve's singing will be glad to know he appears on only one track, with the sole other vocal song handled wonderfully by Claire Hammill. This album is more eclectic than \\"Beginnings\\" and covers more different styles of music. But in doing so it does a better job of revealing Howe's somewhat schizophrenic musical nature. What makes him so interesting as a guitar player is that he's always pulling from the varied influences represented here: rock (\\"Penants\\"), country (\\"Meadow Rag\\"), jazz (\\"The Continental\\"), and classical (\\"Surface Tension\\"). The good news is that each track succeeds and a few are downright stellar. Howe has another go at an epic length orchestra-plus-guitar effort, \\"Double Rondo\\", which stands as probably his finest accomplishment ever. If you're going to own one album by this remarkable guitarist, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Craftsman, Workmanlike Howe Goodness","review":"I bought this on vinyl when it came out. At that time I had no idea what to make of it. I recall liking Chris Squire's FISH OUT OF WATER better. OLIAS OF SUNHILLOW? Jon Anderson's first solo album? Well?Looking back all these years ago(and yes, I upgraded immediately when it came out in CD); All I can say is that while this album has its obvious flaws; It works on its own internal logic. I find most Howe solo albums seem to radiate an internal consistency that really makes their deconstruction in a review relatively meaningless.Alot of Yes musical history has gone beneath the bridge since this rather understated and highly listenable first solo album by Steve Howe made its inconspicious debut back in 1975. I always reach back for this album and THE STEVE HOWE ALBUM. Mostly by instinct.But this is where it all began..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down from a huge Yes fan","review":"I got all five solo efforts by the members of Yes in 1975-1976, and the only good thing you can say about this one is that Alan White's effort (Ramshackle) was worse.As the other reviewers note, Steve Howe simply can't sing, and I find his attempts unlistenable. Those of you accustomed to crystal clear vocals from Jon Anderson are in for quite a shock if you get this album.Steve's guitar playing can also be pretentious, and this album lacks other band members to control those impulses. Don't get me wrong - he's a great guitar player. But I prefer good music to continuous displays of virtuosity. He seems to always being trying to say \\"Hey, look how good I am\\", instead of just trying to make good, coherent, well-structured music.If you like Yes stuff from this period, and want to sample the solo efforts, try Chris Squire's \\"Fish Out of Water\\" first.

At their best they were every bit as good and original as any group that has ever existed. Name any supergroup...and that group will not have more innate talent. However, this album is like going to the generic aisle in a supermarket and picking up a box called \\"Competently Played Pop Music (Soul Free.)\\" It's like eating tasteless food, or drinking flat soda, or making love with someone you really don't love. Whoever brought this travesty about is evil - and it was NOT Klaatu. Do yourself a favor and skip this one.

I instatenly fell in LOVE with the story and was very excited to watch the movie. i like how the original Shakespearian language was kept in the film, along with the setting. i saw both this, and the newer version of this movie and like this one MUCH better. i highly suggest this movie to anyone who likes Shakespeare, or at least can understand it. this is such a beautiful romantic story and Olivia and Leonard did an amazing job bringing the story to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Version of the Classic - Highly Recommended!","review":"The Franco Zeffirelli production of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" is by far my all time favorite version of the classic play. Staring Olivia Hussey as Juliet, this movie really captures the feel of the period and brings the story to life. The sets and costumes were simply perfect and the feast scene with the dancing and moving song is perhaps the most powerful movie memory I have from my teen years. The emotion of the movie comes through.We watched this with our teen daughter who wanted to try out for her senior class play. She read along and practiced the lines to get the emotions correct.This is a fantastic story, brought to life in a stunning movie.Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Romeo and Juliet","review":"This DVD can't be played as it's region 1 and Australia is in Region 2.

We were given the chance to view two films: Zeffirelli's classic and Luhrmans version. Zeffirelli's blew me away. I love the fact that finally the two characters are played by people of the correct age, people who would actually understand how Romeo and Juliet were feeling, how they would react. The various productions with twenty-somethings in the lead role just do not seem to have the same naivity, innocence and \\"first-love\\" that is essential. Olivia Hussy and Leonard Whiting capture it perfectly.A must see"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet","review":"I have always loved the play,Romeo & Juliet. This has got to be the Best or one of the best portrayals of a Play by William Shakespeare. You are totally drawn into the action and emotions of Shakespeare's story. Some of Shakespeare's words and ideas are strange to our thinking, but the actors do a good job saying the lines in a believable smoothness and yet helping you to understand the ideas and frames of mind of the speakers.

I saw the film when it came out. These brilliant colors are faithful to Zeffirelli's production. I own the film in VHS, but have never seen it with such visual intensity.Perhaps the most famous line in the English language spoken by Juliet: \\"O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?...\\"I believe you know Juliet Capulet and Romeo Montague, two teens from Verona, Italy. Franco Zeffirelli cast teenagers Olivia Hussey and Leonard Whiting in the leading roles. The 60s film was incredibly well done. Of course, this is Shakespear's 1592 stage romance. I know you will be pleased to own this DVD.Notes: this film (c)1968 Paramount Pictures. This DVD is in the original widescreen format."},{"rating":"1","title":"High school drama.","review":"Bloated 1968 version of Shakespeare's tale of star-crossed lovers. Despite the incredibly expensive production design, despite the authentic costumes and locales, despite the doubtless much-rehearsed sword-duel between Leonard Whiting and Michael York, despite the then-relevant echoes of youth counterculture, the movie remains reminiscent of a Cliffs Notes Shakespeare put on by your local high school. In one respect it's refreshing to see actual teenagers play the roles: the old familiar lines in the text seem almost new, as spoken by Whiting and Olivia Hussey, probably because the lines weren't so old or familiar to them. But that finally doesn't compensate for the fact that as actors they're simply too young to handle the verse. Zeffirelli tried to put as much realism, emotional and pictorial, as possible into his movie -- but he probably should've asked himself whether that very realism defeated the whole purpose of the play by Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Acting","review":"I read the play Romeo and Juliet in my Shakespeare class, and thought is was a very good play.

The acting in the movie is just HORRIBLE.On all the parts, it is either overdone or underdone.And on top of that,they cut out alot of dialogue toward the end.I think there is a reason why Shakespeare wrote these plays for the stage.

Zeffirelli's daring casting of teenagers Len Whiting and Olivia Hussey in the title roles is perfect in the context of the play of two star-crossed teen lovers. Another ideal casting choice was Michael York as Juliet's cousin, Tybalt. York brings a particular venom to the role, all the while revealing his skill and training as a fencer and former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

So I'm not a hater of the genre. When I first saw Airplane about two years ago I laughed until I cried. Just days after seeing it I was in an electronic store and saw Airplane 2 on DVD. Assuming it was made by the guys that made the original I bought it, oh how wrong I was. This is nothing but a sad attempt to copy the success of the original. Paramount asked the Zuckers and Jim Abrahams to do the sequel, when they declined saying there's not enough jokes left to do a sequel Paramount just hired some other guy to do it. The result, Airplane 2 crashes and burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious BECAUSE some jokes are recycled","review":"Airplane II is the perfect sequel to a parody movie like Airplane!. As a major complaint about sequels is they simply repeat the original with subtle changes it only makes sense for the sequel to Airplane to address this directly by almost copying some jokes almost verbatim. I sometimes enjoy the sequel more because the jokes never stop, in Airplane!, the last 20 minutes were slow with the jokes as the plot was being wrapped up.I am giving the DVD only 1 star because it only has the movie, no special features not even an audio commentary.

The problem I had with this film is that, within the first seconds of the film, the viewer(s) is exposed to some brief female nudity. That would not have warranted a warning, if it was not for this fact. The movie is rated PG.There might be some that would not find that problematic, but I intend on being able to share many of the films that I own with those that are youthful in my family.The opening scene is troubling to me.It showed women being scanned and then their naked bodies were displayed on a screen for all to see.

On a large scale, the humor was too minuscule at best, trampled by the comparison to the first film. Obviously, there is no story, just a stupid repeat of the same plot used in Airplane!. During the movie, there is a particular scene where Striker narrates his sad story to the lady beside her. She got seasick by the sound of it and proceeded to vomit in a bag.

We know about that already it does not need to be said again, and I could go on and on. I laughed, but not because of this one, because it reminds me of the first one.

Much of the material is nothing more than a variation of what was in the original \\"Airplane!,\\" which makes for a rather dull and predictable movie.In \\"Airplane 2,\\" the writers do try to vary the plot a bit by changing the venue to the 21st century but this does more harm than good.

It was very difficult to force myself to read more than one chapter per sitting because of the book's repetitiveness and dullness. If you actually want to read it, let me save you the time while I summarize it:-Spend more time hiking than working.-Don't get a well paying job, because it will make you miserable and you will undoubtedly go into dept.-take a low paying job, because life will be great. As long as you dont want to buy anything.-Don't buy material goods that make you happy.-Only nature and people make you happy.-Rich people, 90% of the time are littering, stuck-up, scumbags.pack that into 250 pages, and there you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Book on Materialism in American society","review":"I love this book because it helped me realize the vanity and greed of materialism. Just reading this book for my English 1A Class in college, I could relate to people who spent money on useless things that they didn't need either squandering all their money or heightening their credit card debt.Indeed, American society is heavily declining due to Affluenza. Because of Affluenza, morality and family values have declined heavily. When was the last time have you seen a father and son having a good family get together at the park? The father is cooped up watching the Superbowl on satellite TV and ths son is busy playing is Sony Playstation 2 or chatting on AOL Instant Messenger.Shocking but true because I have seen Affluenza hit my family and especially the people that I know big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pointless and meaningless rant","review":"I dont know how many times I have read this same book: It rehashes the same old stale arguments heard over and over. The material world is bad, spending is bad, consumption is bad... yap yap yappity yap.Nobody denies that there is something wrong with our economy and culture, and we need to fix that, but the boring and unoriginal rant that Simon offers does nothing for our understanding of the dynamics or nature of consumerism.In the end, this book is nothing but a empty status symbol for the kind of consumerist yuppies that Simon seems to abhor. If you want to show people that you are a concerned pseudo-intellectual, who is all concerned about the future of our planet and society, you buy this book and have it lying around your house.What a load of pretentious crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never received it.

You need to read twice to get the complete idea. But the book can be read by workflows (disciplines) individually to emphasize your interest areas. I'm sorry for the folks that think this book is publicity for the Rational software. Did they read the book? This book is already part of the RUP AS A PRODUCT. I read because i want to complete my knolwedge on the process and software engineer process iteself. The book emphasizes in the goods of the process as a process model and a framework not as a product. Buy it, if you are interested in one of the most popular software engineer process outer or want to get some good advices to your own processes.

The trouble is, it's such a high level introduction that there's almost no useful information whatsoever. The entire time I was reading, I was waiting for the author to get to the meat, only to discover at the end that there was none. It was like ordering a double cheeseburger, and getting two buns with ketchup and a pickle, and no beef patties.I can only assume that Rational paid the author for his time in the hopes that people, after reading this book, would purchase their entire software suite just to find out what the RUP actually involves.Despite my severe disappointment (and relief that I didn't have to pay for it myself), I can't rate it any lower than two stars. It's well written, and it could quite possibly be useful to managers and other business types who have no idea how software development works. The second star is for Rational's sheer chutzpah in getting a respected publisher to put out a $30 marketing pamphlet for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"This is a wonderful book.

The original black and white version is infinitely superior to this poorly done colorization.Now, the good news. This film showcases Spencer Tracy's remarkable acting ability and he delivers a witty and intelligent performance as Elizabeth Taylor's long-suffering father. Spence has several monologues which are a joy to watch. His acting gift (along with Charles Laughton) is an absolute wonder and it's always a pleasure to watch him. Joan Bennet is adequate in a supporting role and Elizabeth Taylor is breathtaking as the 18-year-old soon to be wed daughter. Liz's performance is actually quite good and her interplay with Tracy is especially effective.Yes, this movie is dated in places, but Tracy's performance is worth watching the entire movie. He is in nearly every scene and transforms a seemingly average movie into something really special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colorized Version","review":"Beware - this version of a classic film is COLORIZED.

Although Madonna and Rupert Everett have a nice chemistry, that's about the only good thing about the movie. The script is terrible and the choices made seem less from the director than Madonna and Rupert themselves. Madge insisted her character be changed from a school teacher to a yoga instructor. It's silly and Madonna, like in many of her films except for Evita and Swept Away, never connects with the character. The strange lighting (especially around Madonna's eyes) is distracting and seems to take on a new type of lighting in film: \\"The Light Madonna This Way Lighting Technique\\".A miserable experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wished for more....","review":"I had high expectations for this movie and anticipated what I should expect with controversial storyline and the incredible cast. However, it saddens me that the movie lacked realism and honesty. Being a huge Madonna fan, I really was hoping for more, but her performance felt forced and lacked sincerity. I felt most of the performaces individually were outstanding, but with Madonna's \\"acting\\" the film just didn't work. I do encourage you to see it, explore it, and make your own opinions, but that is mine and I'm staying woth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not necessarily a waste, but real close","review":"I wasn't expecting a great movie from the likes of Madonna (although I do believe her to be a great performer on the music stage), but I did think I would get more than poor acting and crummy script. I was also surprised to see this type of work from the likes of Rupert Evert, but once Ben Bratt showed up and his performance was just as shaky, I realized that it was entire chemistry of the film. There was no continuity, and I swear there were times when it seemed Madonna was on the verge of tripping up her lines. Not to mention the fact that they had a child around 9 years old playing a character that was supposed to be 5 or 6. How stupid do they think the viewing audience is? I won't be recommending this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronising","review":"This movie treats gays like preteens keen on, but too afraid to have sex with women. It reeks with anti-gay stereotypes without even being funny. It could be described as Madonna's ego trip delusion that all gay men are hot for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie doesn't even deserve a star...","review":"OK, I knew it would be bad. But, I love yoga and have heard a lot about Madonna's ability as a yogini. I sat through this entire agonizing movie to see one 45 second second scene of her doing yoga. {SIGH} Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Next Best Thing","review":"The product came quite quickly but unfortunately I'm unable to watch it because it says it's from a different region."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate this movie...","review":"i don't like this movie at all. the plot is just dumb and really bad. the soundtrack is good though. i can't say that madonna is one of the best actress out there but she has a few, good decent films. if you're a fan, just skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"This movie is mediocre. It's worth watching one time. Madonna actually gives a good performance in this movie, and so does Rupert Everette. This movie could have been really good if it hadn't been pulled into so many directions. This movie is never sure of what direction it wants to go in. The plot twist towards the end of the movie is completely ridiculous. Sam should have been Robert's biological son. The movie was trying to portray unconventional families, but when it's revealed that Sam is not Robert's son, it destroys the whole concept of the movie. The dialog was so horrible. Nobody heaps a bunch of compliments on someone when they are breaking up with them, and the dialog in the courtroom scene is so unrealistic that it's funny. Madonna is not to blame for this movie being a bomb. The script and dialog is why this movie is ignored and mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"MADONNA PUSHING A GROCERY CART? RIIIIGGGHHHT!","review":"I SAW THIS MOVIE ON MY WAY FROM SEATTLE TO TOKYO AND I WAS APALLED TO SEE TWO OF MY FAVORITE STARS LOOKING LIKE EVERYDAY PEOPLE. HODGE PODGE! THE STORY IS A GOOD STORY AND I LOVE THE WAY THIS MOVIE REFLECTS ON HOW HARD IT REALLY IS TO FIND SOMEONE YOU WANT TO FALL IN LOVE WITH BUT RUPERT AND MADONNA DON'T BELONG HERE. IT'S JUST NOT BELIEVABLE. THE ENDING NEEDED A LOT MORE AS WELL. A LOT MORE! I WOULD PUT SOMETHING IN FOR THE DVD BUT I HAVEN'T VIEWED IT AND I DON'T REALLY HAVE A DESIRE TO SINCE THIS MOVIE IS JUST BASIC HOLLYWOOD MUMBO JUMBO STARRING BIG NAMES."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad - Really Bad","review":"I tried so hard to like this movie, but after about 20 mins I found it impossiable. Madonna delivers simply the worst acting performance of her career. Many of her lines are Re-Dubbed and sound both fake and strange. The story is barely there and seems to go no where. I kept asking myself why I kept watching this movie and the answer was because I really did want it to turn out better... it didn't. If I had seen this at the movie theater I would have walked out. SKIP IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really just so-so","review":"I've watched this movie twice, and I am not sure I will watch it again.First of all, I'm one who had never had anything bad to say about Madonna's acting, but here she's really bad. She gets better and the movie progresses, it's almost distracting, because she's supposed to be the center of the attention.Rupert Everett is fine, he looks dashing of course, like Benjamin Bratt.But then, the movie itself is really badly done. They had the locations, the sets, and yet it's just not at all good and almost boring at times, not to mention the familiar places we've been at before and the really annoying court scenes. Just how many times do we have to see attorneys trashing innocent people?Honestly, there is nothing new in this movie to make it worth watching more than once to convince yourself how not good it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not as bad as I thought","review":"I saw this film after hearing enough of bad reputation of the film. Madonna does well in musicals because she can sing and dance, but acting is not something she is good at.The story itself was not too bad. It was just that good acting was missing in the movie. I don't know why a smart hard working person like Madonna did so poorly in the film. With the interesting story they could have done better. It's too bad that it turned out like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna as a Yoga Instructor Sporting a British Accent = BAD","review":"Now you'd think that by putting director John Schlesinger and Rupert Everett together something interesting would transpire--that is until you realize that Madonna's been added to the mix and therefore completely sinks an already vapid storyline even further. Unfortunately, it's not so bad that it's good (like \\"Showgirls\\")--it's just bad. Avoid this boring homophobic mess at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"So... I certainly respect everyone's right to have their own opinion, but it boggles my mind how so many of the reviewers seemed to love this film! It was pretty darned bad. While Madonna's \\"I'm british, no I'm not\\" accent was somewhat entertaining, her character's complete personality shift 2/3 of the way through made no sense and totally pushed the rest of this already mediocre film downhill. If you think this plot was a good idea, but you want to experience *some* entertainment from it, go rent \\"The Object Of My Affection.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Tragic.....","review":"The best that can be said is that this movie kept me watching...I kept waiting for Madonna to 1) figure out where her accent was coming from and 2) let go of the stiff, tense, and downright atrocious acting. Look, I'm not anti-Madonna. In fact, I wanted to like this movie and I still applaud the theory of a \\"family movie with a twist\\". However, this movie was truly horrid. The acting was so appauling I cringed everytime a laugh was expected. If you are interested in a dumbfounding waste of time, watch \\"The Next Best Thing.\\" Side note: I'm horrified that this was the same director who brought us \\"Midnight Cowboy\\"!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I ANTICIPATED!","review":"I agree with everyone that gave this movie 1 or 2 stars. This wasn't Madonna's best movie. It had poor acting, bad script, and much more. This is definitely a renter not a buyer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna Deserves Much Much Better","review":"The main problem with \\"The Next Best Thing\\" is that the movie is very flat and some parts leave you thinking \\"what?\\". The acting was terrific but I didn't feel that Madonna's character and Rupert's character were best friends at all, in fact Madonna's character was extremely underdeveloped. Her not allowing Rupert to see the boy came out of nowhere, and was totally stupid. Madonna is a good actress but this movie won't help that aspect of her career at all. \\"The Next Best Thing\\" is bogged down in melodramatic nosense that hides it potential to really make an important statement about the changing reality of families. And the ending! I was so mad-I thought \\"This is totally twisted-it is too stupid!\\". If you want to see a good Madonna movie, skip \\"The Next Best Thing\\" and grab \\"Evita\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was Embarrassed!","review":"I am a huge Madonna fan. I love her music...I think I own every CD she has ever done, along with virtually every movie.. including this one (unfortunately).I read that this movie was supossed to be a sequel to \\"My Best Friends Wedding,\\" and that Julia Roberts was offered the part and dodged it. I can see why.This movie was thrown together, and many of the people in it are not even part of the story line. Although I could follow the story line (the plot is not that difficult to undertand) most of the movie carried no logic. It flowed like broken glass, and felt like it too! The characters are completely stupid, and their behavior is very odd.I was embarrassed, and almost didn't finish the movie. (That is saying a lot, considering how much I love Madonna.)Even the ending was bad, but I was glad it was over! If I ever watch it again, it will only be to see the \\"American Pie\\" video."},{"rating":"1","title":"The next best thing to tonsilectomy!","review":"I just had my tonsils taken out, and that was the most painful experience of my life. Watching this movie was a close second.Madonna has got to be the worst actress to get on a movie screen. Her inability to express any emotion is uncanny. Rupert is no better. Just because someone speaks with an English accent, that doesn't make him a good actor (as some reviewers tend to think). He literally competes with Madonna throughout the entire movie to see who will put the least effort and emotion in a scene. At least Madonna has got her music to fall back on. The plot is so silly that it doesn't even deserve a mention. The dramatic turn, half way through the movie, only makes the actors more uncomfortable, becoming even more unconvincing.Please, Madonna, stick to your music. We love your albums, but your movies stink!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Am I the only one who was completely disturbed by the Madonna's character disgraceful deception? (Don't want to ruin it for the unwashed, but trust me, it doesn't matter.) To add insult to injury, we are subjected the the constant references to Madonna's beauty, considering that she looks well past 40 and tired thoughout the entire movie. We are treated to Madonna's moments of flexibility as a Yoga instructor. Be warned, Madonna is now sporting a British accent. The only bright light is Benjamin Bratt, who has absolutly nothing to work with. My suggestion is to gather some good friends and view it for the numerous yuks."},{"rating":"1","title":"is it a surprise that Madonna ruined a film?","review":"Just god awful!!!!

It was warm, funny, but also poignant. I laughed and cried. It's an easy and quick read, but not without some very deep thoughts as well.The entire book consists of emails, which I thought was quite clever. Also quite a challenge for the author, to differentiate between the \\"voices\\" without having the usual writer's props like descriptions of the people's facial expressions, looks, etc. Meredith Efkin does a wonderful job with this new form.

The book is delightful, charming, funny, and full of astute observations on human nature...just like Jane Austen's writings. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For The Kids","review":"This book was written for kids who enjoyed the remake of Planet of the Apes. Grown-ups will probably not enjoy it but it was not intended for grown-ups. The book is a nice effort for the kids.

It is nice to see that a new generation of Apes has begun and I welcome the effort of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this book as I facilitate marriage preparation workshops. ... I would agree that there are several pertinent questions asked, however many of the questions seem like they are 'space fillers'. This along with a lot of spacing and extremely large font look like an unfortunate attempt to make a 'book' ... out of something that could be written on 1-2 sheets of paper. Please don't get me wrong, I strongly believe in couples preparing for their engagements and marriages, and I believe that couples should talk about many of the subjects listed in this book, I just don't personally and professionally feel that this book is worth the money. There are many other relationship oriented books that would provide better guidance for couples as they get to know one another and prepare for their upcoming marriages."},{"rating":"2","title":"bringing us closer together","review":"This book sheds a new light on the true meaning of relationships. My fiance and I will be getting married this July and we thought we had just about covered everything a couple would need to know about each other before they tied the knot. Boy were we wrong, this book opened up dialogue between the two of us and we reviewed and answered the questions in it for weeks, we even made a little game out of it. We feel so much closer to each other after getting this book.

The best way to descrive the sounds would be to imagine a slot machine at a casino...fine when you are in Vegas but not the nursery.

This is a collection of about 30 two to three page essays ranging from his personel religious opinions to listings of outrageous factiods on the three Abraham religions:Judaism, Christianity and Islam. I checked out on the net some of the presented information in a few of these essays that were most questionable to me such as the Jesus-Buddha mythology and the yoni art designs incorporated in Catholic church art. Sure enough, these parallels exist. While his writing style and argument approach aren't going to win adherents from believers and certainly will piss off some true atheists, his essays will make you think. I recommend buying a used copy and spending a few hours in a coffee shop. Its a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why atheism has a bad name!","review":"This is the worst book I've read read on atheism. Katz's conclusions are based on false premises and misinterpreted evidence. This book is a knee-jerk reaction to theism; the very reaction that allows theists to easily dismiss the atheist standpoint.

That even a \\"wah-wah\\" publisher such as Prometheus would bother to print such drivel is entirely beyond me. It is, as another reviewer has stated, a pointless hodge-podge of at best minimally related subjects. The author's views on various theological and Christian issues are laughable and based on the \\"argument from outrage\\", i.e., the idea that the God of the Bible does not exist because he is branded a moral monster. For example, he concludes that God effectively raped various women in the Bible, which is of course both utterly offensive and patently disprovable. This is a claim I have heard stated by atheists before, but I never thought I would actually see it in print. By the time I got through the first twenty pages or so I knew I wasting my time, and souring an otherwise perfectly good shrimp scampi. 1 star is too much for this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"These guys are losers...","review":"I bought this book hoping it could help explain why my boyfriend, after 3 years, decided that he simply was \\"unhappy\\" and wanted to break up.I enjoyed some of Dr. Shoshanna's other insights into communication but this book was way off for me.

I could not relate my situation to any of the men or women in the book and if a lot of people can, then that is trully sad.I was with a man that was genuinly a great person and treated me well, always good to me, but had his own self esteem issues which permeated into the relationship. He had a difficult past and bad relationships that left him scared and i think unable to really commit for fear.Anyhow if your guy did you wrong, if you had a emotionally abusive relationship or if you were playing mind games with eachother this book is for you!

I intentionally included both very conservative and very Charismatic texts, in order to be able to present the range of opinion on the subject. Brian Carraway's book is the delightful exception that takes a moderate, well-argued centrist position. Well worth reading for anyone interested in learning about spiritual gifts (hint: that should be all Christians)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very motivational","review":"If you have breath in your body, you need to read this book. If God gave you breath then he gave you spiritual gifts as well and wants you to use them.The author of this book gives a balanced account of spiritual gifts, what they are, how to know if you have them, and how to develop them. This book is like \\"one-stop-shopping\\" for everything you need to know about spiritual gifts. The author pulls on his extensive background in biblical studies to write authoritatively about his subject. But his tone is conversational and easier to read than many other books on the subject, and it's never condescending.

This album is boring, musically and lyrically. Gone are the days of well written songs, this seems more likely to be heard on the radio than the older materials. That's fine if that's what you're into, but I was hoping for more than just simple pop songs. I fell in love with this bands emotion and power, which was displayed with interesting music.

Otherwise, you'd swear this is Evanescence's experimental follow-up album. But in the end this is Melodic Hard Rock with many catchy hooks/choruses and songs that could easily be played on the radio. The role of the violin here is just as vital as the role of a guitar, dominating throughout the record and enhancing the music. Without it, this record would probably be extremely unoriginal. Basic, yet energetic female vocals keep the flow of the music listenable. There are some brilliant musical passages like in the song \\"Shut Up\\" (1:46-2:14), as well as silly male verbal chants (like on \\"Blah Blah\\" 2:56-3:10), but overall the harmlessness and accessibility of the material is enough to satisfy the open-minded ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd compare them to Lennon, as well","review":"Many of the songs remind me of Lennon (the woman, not the Beatle... she was named after him). Sure, there's some similarity to Evanescence, especially because of the rather pervasive and heavy nu-metal sound throughout the album. The violin definitely adds an interesting element. While the album isn't flawless, it's an interesting start and is worth at least a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action/adventure novel concerning Modesty Blaise","review":"The Silver Mistress is one of several books about Modesty Blaise and her faithful companion Willie Gravin. Modesty is a self-made millionaire (gained when she led a criminal network in her early 20s). She and Willie retired but found the quiet life didn't appeal and among other things, took jobs for the British Intelligence network. They are both experts in martial arts along with other various skills (lock picking, flying, parachuting, etc.)Silver Mistress concerns their actions to rescue Tarrant (head of Brit Intel and friend) from a gang of blackmailers. It contains one of the best fight sequences ever written, from whence the title comes. Modesty versus the bad martial artist.While this little review leaves so much unsaid, it is better than none at all.

The good news is if you need more freezing time, it is easy to add time at the end.A note: after freezing one batch, you need to turn off the compressor so it can rest for 60 minutes before freezing another batch; you cannot make batch after batch without stopping.

His solution to the unpaid overtime is to lie to your employer and coworkers about how much you work at home, use oversized containers to take work home so it looks like more, schedule outside appointments late in the dy so you can just go home, etc. A lot of the book is aimed at helping people take better care of themselves and get their priorities in order, which I applaud. But that isn't what I was looking for in a time management book. I was looking for practical strategies for organizing my work and time, which it is thin on. It has some, and there are some very good ideas in there, but not really much more than a good magazine article."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is it with Jeff Davidson and bogus reviews?","review":"First off, I didn't care for the book.

Two reviews on this book are simply content from the book posted as a review.I read reviews to get a true picture of what people think. I'm not easily manipulated by shill reviews.

It has his signature unparalleled beauty but is also unusually thoughtful, with intriguing musings on illusion vs. reality and the nature of love, beauty, and art. Keats' lament about empiricism destroying natural wonder has heavily influenced everyone from Edgar Allen Poe to Richard Dawkins, and Lamia remains central to the art/nature vs. science debate. The story is also interesting in itself; Keats brings a fantasy world vividly to life, draws us in emotionally, and even has a devastating ending. Finally, the poem is impressive technically, showing Keats' growing couplet mastery. One should certainly read his best-known works first, but this should be an early stop; that said, the fact that it is virtually every Keats collection makes a standalone very hard to justify. The important thing at any rate is to read it in some form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooops","review":"I accidently mixed up this book with one from my H P Lovecraft collection and instead of talking with Kuthumi about visiting Bimini I ended up talking with Cthulhu about visiting R'lyeh.

It shouldn't even be associated with the original, because at least the original came up with it's own ideas and had some character development. In The Mummy Returns, it was all special effects. Nothing more than that. Sure, they were great, but it got real old halfway through this stale and utterly disappointing film.It seemed Stephen Sommers only focus was on the special effects and nothing else.The Mummy Returns was a pitiful attempt at a sequel, and hopefully, but not likely, this will be the last movie in this series. 2 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Fun","review":"Let's wake up the dead again.

Action movies with kids in the story are lame, this one is no exception. I like the Mummy Movies because I like Egypt and the history, but the winks at the camera and the kid are so dated -- it really makes a bomb out of this. Attempts to incorporate every action movie staple really wear thin -- like the pigmy mummies clearly using the Lord of the Rings troll figure -- whatever his name is -- didn't see it -- never will.But there is some true humor here listening to the director commentary and how clueless he is to just how horid this film is. He even ridicules Roger Ebert who had legitimate complaints that these knuckleheads dismiss out of hand -- like they never considered, or finally realized, the movie wasn't good.Some positives: Rachael Weisz is great -- and so is all of the cast -- wasted by bad period directing. ILM effects are great and fun to watch.

I liked this one. The 4 stars are for the special effects, which far outweigh the story, or lack thereof. The skeletons chasing the double-decker bus were excellent, as were the dog-warriors, and although I thought they were quite silly as a plot device, the pygmies were nicely done. My gripes: the storyline was weak (I'm still trying to remember the point, but this gripe is well covered in other reviews), the kid was a typical precocious movie brat, the entire air balloon segment was wholly unnecessary, and the Scorpion King effect at the end was just awful (what, did they run out of special effects money by the time they got to the end?). I did like the past-life-visiting-the-present-life aspect of the story, though, as well as the perfectly nasty villainess. Also bonus points for the cornucopia of extras on the DVD, which is one of the big reasons I buy DVDs -- if I just wanted to watch the movie, I'd buy a tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Monster Walks","review":"The Mummy (1999) was perhaps the greatest achievement in the Adventure-genre since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), while the sequel suffers quite a lot from the fact, that it was obviously rushed for commercial reasons.

While watching \\"The Mummy 2: The Crummy\\", I kept saying to myself \\"What the (expletive)?\\". The little pigmy monsters, the elaborate sand models the kid made, the balloon, the fake looking CG when mixed with real people, the...everything.The reason I give it two stars instead of zero, is that I liked the way it flushed out the story between the mummy and his woman, expanding on the footage shown at the beginning of the first film. If you really liked the first one, a lot, watch this movie once to get that back story, and then forget about it. Or don't watch it at all, so you can have a fond memory of the first one. Actually, you should go rent the old 1932 version of the mummy. It's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION!

The Cringometer peaked over the red line from the opener and climaxed with some of the worst CG ever. The Rock- more like The Crock! Possibly the worst film in any aspect ratio, preferable on NO SCREEN. Had hoped that Stephen Sommers would be sent into exile for this sub-par Jules Verne abortion, but we've just seen Van Helsing and don't understand why he hasn't suicided."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Return","review":"I received this product in a very timely fashion, however I did not realize that it was only for an HD DVD player, (error on my part). Once I realized I had made this mistake, I contacted the company to exchange for regular DVD or Blue-ray. They told me that they only have HD-DVD's and would not refund. Lesson learned I guess.Not very timely in their response either way nor good customer service.I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment...","review":"The 1999 version of THE MUMMY was spectacular. So when this movie came out, I had high hopes for it. But this was a waste of my time! The film makers did a rather stupid thing of bringing ALL of the characters back for this movie. That was a BIG mistake! They also tried to make this one a little more funny. It just didnt't work out. But despite all the bad things I've said about it, there are some good things. Great suspense and most of the action was cool. But the ending fight scene with Brendan Fraser and The Rock went on forever. Rent this one first."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the edition, 3 for the movie","review":"Not a very great sequel (like most), but come on, enough already with the double dipping. Granted, we all KNEW this would come out as soon as they announced the third film (I don't count any film starring a has been wrestler as a sequel, sorry, that's just how I roll). Seems we get two new featurettes, and again, as SOON as the third film comes out on DVD, there'll be ANOTHER re-release. Wait for that one, I'm sure it will be \\"fantastic.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever?","review":"One of my friends rented this movie and invited a bunch of people over, thinking it would be a good cinema experience. Boy, was he wrong. This movie is possibly the most predictable movie EVER. One of my friends predicted the entire bus scene perfectly. And of course the main characters are saved just in the nick of time. And the girl's make up stays on after taking an adventure in the water, too. I could go on and on about all the little details of this film, but I don't think it's really worth it.Watching this movie with my friends turned out to be like Mystery Science Theater 3000. I'm almost tempted to give \\"The Mummy Returns\\" two stars for being a good party movie, if only because it's so easy to make fun of. Rent it with your friends if you're bored, and you might get a kick out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Were They Thinking?","review":"I thought that Mummy Returns was a big step downward from the first one. The first one was only a little sci-fi but they made it believable and also stayed pretty close to Egyption Mythology, the second one...First of all the filming is horrible, there are so many parts where it is completly obviouse that it is fake, like when they are flying the dirigible and in the last where The Rock is the Scorpion King, whoa! I think that this movie was too sci-fi, the little pygmies did not fit with the context of the show as well as some other things. There were not as many good speciel effects as the last one, but more fighting scenes.I think it was a dissapointment after watching the first one. If there was a negative star on this rating, that's what I would give it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you kidding? This movie was great!","review":"I loved this film - the action, the effects, the cast and crew - everything was marvelous! And the pace was perfect - exactly what you expect from an action film.

It's a real treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big win for WWF fanatics -- Cheesy AND Predictable","review":"I liked the first movie \\"The Mummy\\", but would not recommend \\"The Mummy Returns\\" to anyone, sober.Really weak plot and dialogue. Be prepared for *hammy* acting and poor character development. Painful at times.Special effects OK, but not as dramatic as 1st movie. Certain creature near the end was really fake looking. ...like producers ran-out of time and just said, \\"good enough\\".Nearly everything was predictable -- only one or two surprises.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comment on DVD format; not movie","review":"I will leave a review of the movie to other (although I thought it was great) and will comment only on the format of the DVD.I think this is the worst DVD I have bought in terms of format. Not only when you select play movie does the the movie not play, you have to skip through several pre-movie talks and coming soons. You will eventually get to the start of the movie but you can't just press one button to play. I hope this trend will not continue, but no expectations.Other than this annoyance the DVD plays great."},{"rating":"2","title":"110% Fun","review":"Folks, if you say bad things about a movie like this, you need to get a life. This is what we call a \\"popcorn movie\\". It's in theaters in the summer, when most people are off from school and are on vacation. That means they want to have FUN.F.....U.....NAnd that's EXACTLY what this movie does. It's thrilling, it's exciting, funny, scary, and fun. It's bigger, better, and louder.And the best part: the kid is NOT annoying!! Like anyone, I hate when a movie is ruined by a kid actor (SW: Phantom Menace), but this kid is an exception. HE should've been in the last SW.If you like The Mummy, you'll LOVE The Mummy Returns. If not, get a life and stop being so critical. It's a MOVIE, not a political statement."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Mummy Review","review":"I thought that this was a great movie because it had a lot of action and i just really really liked it.(Brendan Fraser is hot and my mom thinks that Arnold Vosloo is handsom.) When it first came out in theaters i wanted to see it but i didnt see the first one so me and my friend rented it and really liked it so maybe a week later i went and saw it thought it was awesome and at the theaters i saw it nine times. I bought the first one and i watch it over and over again. I cant wait untill October second, my dad even said that he would watch the Mummy and right after that the Mummy Returns. The thing thats bad though is its on a Tuesday so I'll probably have homework, and then four hours of movies. So for everyone that hasn't seen this movie I think you should its a very good movie and the kids would like it too, but there is violence and swearing depends how young they are the might be scared. So i say go and see it. They are my two favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"??????????????","review":"if everyone liked this,what movie did i stumble into????this was ''alright'' up until the ridiculous ending.nowadays,especially with sequals,prequals,1/2 way through it seems like the director is on autopilot.it had its moments,some good ideas/effects.but compared to the first movie,it COMPLETELY LACKED EVERYTHING.THE CHEMISRTY WAS NON EXISTANT.THE ADDED CHARACTORS WERE BUFFOONS.why do i always get suckered into dishing out $$$$$$ to sequals i know thats gonna rot?my only hope is the matrix.only the ghost of ED WOOD could muck that up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Sequel Since The Mummy!","review":"This is probably the best sequel after it's predecessor. It has two times the effect, two times the laughter and two times the action. And this movie certainly live up to it's name. I must say that this movie is a must for those who can't get over the Mummy from the first movie. Brendan Fraser reprises his role as the good old Rick O'Connell, handsome as ever, and Rachel Weisz as the feisty librarian and wife to Rick, more graceful and beautufulful as ever. Not a bad entrance by The Rock either. This movie is a best-seller in Singapore on DVD! So, I'm sure it would be a big hit over there, too. Two thumbs up! Great movie with great special effects, penned by a great storyline! For those movie buffs who wants to \\"test\\" their home theaters on DVD and haven't get over the horror-adventure movies, this is one hell of a movie NOT to be miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mummy Returns Blu-ray Brings Stunning Video & Great Audio!","review":"Like the first Mummy I saw this one in the theatre aswell and I liked it.The video and audio quality are excellent on this Blu-ray version.This movie is good, I really enjoyed it.

The characters are flat and lifeless and seem to spout off innane comments and one-liners throughout the films pitiful life. The story and plot are non-existent and .... Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed something","review":"As someone who enjoy Saturday matinee type movies, I thought the Mummy Returns would be great, but it was so-so. When was the last time you saw someone die of a stab wound to the abdomen, and show NOT ONE TRACE OF BLOOD!!?? The part of the son had the same effect as in Temple of Doom-- nearly ruined the film for adults. I'd wait for it on TV in a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent continued from Mummmy 1 view (though literized if i may be allowed to use that word) of Ancient Egypt","review":"A perfectly marvelous continuation of Mummy 1 of ancient Egypt . The Graphics and special effects truly enhance the story and are not a substitute for a Story as we see far too often in other movies with second third and etc additional follow up versions of the original.

Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"this is one of the worst movies ever made. I have no clue why it was so popular. First of all, the story is so stupid! Scorpion King? Give me a break! And the special effects look terrible. Woody Woodpecker looks more realistic. If you see this movie, be prepared to see humans interacting with cartoons most of the time. So I guess this movie is just like 'Space Jam.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays like it was adapted from a video game.","review":"If you like non-stop action, care nothing for story or character, and enjoy watching digitized monsters die in a variety of ways, this is the film for you. Otherwise skip it.Brendan Frazier's son has been kidnapped by a powerful, ancient being. In order to save the boy, Frazier must take on countless hoardes of bad guys in a variety of locations. He mowes through them like a superhero from a video game, and despite the non-stop action I found this film almost as dull as watching someone else play Quake for two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"the little movie that tried too hard","review":"Or another review title could be \\"how subplots took over the movie. The best review I can give is my 12 year old son who sums up the movie as \\"kind of dumb\\". So in a nutshell, the effects are great, the plot is stupid and the main charaters do not have the same personalities as in the first movie. Best example is Evie who doesn't even look like the same person anymore. On a last note, if you are going to pay someone 3million dollars to apear in a film (The Rock) shouldn't he at least get a line to speak?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this, a video game?","review":"I have to say that I was grievouly disappointed with the Mummy Returns. For one thing, the special effects were way over done. It made the movie look more like a video game at times, instead of a movie.The new storyline of Evie being reincarnated from the past as an ancient Pharohs daughter was also too much. I know we're talking about Hollywood, but come on! Evie was like a whole new character. She even learned how to fight all the sudden, which she could'nt do in the first movie.There's also the ripoff scene from Jurrasic Park 2 where guys get jumped in the tall grass by raptors. In TMR they use short natives instead.I'm going to avoid buying this movie when it comes out. If I buy a Mummuy Returns Video game, it will probally look the same as the movie, but at least I could play it."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MOVIE","review":"I saw this pathetic movie when it first came out last May and was completely disappointed with it. It's got to be the worst film I've seen this year. The acting is completely lousy as is the script. There is no story at all, the movie is just a bunch of guys running around killing mummies. It's ten times worse than the abysmal first - give THE MUMMY RETURNS a skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 0 stars","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Random and pointless, yadda yadda. I have to wonder how anyone could like it. I sort of liked the first movie, so I figured this would be more of the same. Unfortunately I was oh-so wrong. If you're not absolutely sure you want to buy this movie, whatever you do, watch it before buying! That way you'll avoid feeling supremely ripped off when you realize the DVD you just bought is best used as an expensive coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"How come there weren't any leprechauns or androids?","review":"A lot of people criticized the acting of the little kid in \\"The Mummy Returns\\". I think the bigger problem was that they apparently let him (or his little brother) write the script.Maybe it would have been better if there were TWO dirigibles, or perhaps a Tarantula Queen. Just a thought.\\"The Mummy\\" was entertaining and at least had a thread of a plot to hold things together.\\"The Mummy Returns\\" was swill. This really made money at the box office? That's scarier than the Scorpion King!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"It lived up to what I had Expected.It was almost better than the first one.There are so many twist and turns it keepsyou on your toes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mummy Returns Poor Quality Transfer","review":"While The Mummy Returns is a good movie overall, the DVD Transfer is not that great, especially the soundtrack. The Dolby Digital 5.1 is to loud in most parts of the movie, but on my copy, it seems that when the real action scenes come, the audio reduces itself, and sounds as if it converts to 2-channel sound. Very annoying. Maybe the ghost of the Mummy is playing around with my volume control!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fantasy action-adventure!","review":"I saw this on the big screen, and I loved it! The fantasy elements are great and there's so much sword fights and gunplay it'll knock you silly! However, this does get cheesy at times and the computer-generated effects do tend to get really fake (especially the Scorpion King scene at the end, which looks like something out of \\"Ants\\"). The first one is definetly more realistic and is way better as a horror movie, but this wins over as a fantasy action-adventure. I like them both the same, maybe the first one a teeny-weenie, itsy-bitsy bit more, but I still love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This movie is great. It has greater action than the first movie. But what i really love about it is that it is worth the difference between a VHS and a DVD. The bonus matirel is packed with cool information.

It&#65533;s only a movie.","review":"Judging by some of the really ridiculous reviews written on this board, I could honestly say that they are good deal of people who should be put into mental intuitions. It's a Fantasy movie for heaven sake; nothing in the film is surpose to be real. Only an extremely uptight people would find any fault in this film. It's a popcorn movie, nothing more, nothing less, and if you want reality in a movie like this then you have serious mental problems. Take it for what it is and enjoy. It's really a great movie once you can get pass your ego, and take it for what it truly was made to be. FUN."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie Sucks!","review":"This was an absolutely horrible film. The plot was weak. The Scorpion King (The Rock) at the end of the film looked terrible, one of the worst modern uses of computer animation I have ever seen. Brendan Frasier continues to make bad choices in scripts as this film had not one stitch of redeemable acting in it. Granted this movie is highly ficticious, but the events that happen throughout the film are totally unbelievable even from a fantasy aspect.I only hope a Mummy III never sees the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst I've seen in a long time!","review":"Never-ending boring unoriginal special effects, that would have obscured the story if there had been one, larded with (not spiced with!) mysticistic egyptianesque mumbo jumbo and mushy sentimentality. The only vaguely interesting scenes are the fights between the bad lady and the good lady. I am glad that I viewed this film as a recording - this allowed me to scrole past (fast view) the uninteresting parts - about two thirds! All this is not the fault of the actors! Its too bad because I liked the first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe","review":"Mummy 1 was kind of fun and the special effects were good, but this sequel is pure, ridiculous, tiring tripe.

Visual noise splashed across the screen without rhyme or reason. An action = entertainment mish mash of woefully inadequate characters, couldn't care less, just plain stupid plotting and special effects turned up to a brash, artless, over-reaching 11.Brendan Fraser struggles valiantly against this background of technical hysteria to give something approximating a likable performance with absolutely no help from the so-called script.

You will note the following:-For some reason, the \\"evil\\" Imhotep from the first movie plays a little girl with no good powers.-The CGI Scorpian King at the end was sad, really sad.

The first Mummy movie was Excellent. This second movie had no storyline whatsoever. In the first movie The Mummy becomes mortal and Mr. O'C.onnell kills him. Well in the second movie when they dig him up out of the ground and he becomes alive again. How did he get his powers back?I'm not criticizing the acting.

I can't begin to say how bad it was. The SFX weren't nearly as good as the first, the acting was worse (though I didn't think that'd be possible), and the worst part about the movie was The Rock's head superimposed on a scorpion's body! Ye gods, that was pathetic. I was going into the movie expecting a massive 3-man brawl b/w the Mummy, Fraser, and The Rock. That would've made the movie more enjoyable, but alas, Hollywood couldn't be that interesting. So, if you're looking for an enjoyable action flick, look elsewhere. Go buy \\"Predator\\" and see what Hollywood used to put out as an action flick. Don't waste your money on this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"........zzzzzzzzzzz","review":"I fell asleep several times while watching mummy returns. No character development and thin plot.

Non-stop entertainment.Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz are so good together. The young boy who plays their son is a wonderful little actorJohn Hannah is so great as the bumbling guttless brother. He is so hilariously funny. And the addition of Shaun Parkes as Izzy makes for some funny gags!Oded Fehr is awesome in the role and very handsome, dark and mysterious. Arnold Vosloo is so wonderful as the bad dark and evil Imhotep. And, Patricia Velasquez is a beautiful evil reincarnate love!It helps if you see the first movie before watching this one. There are a number of running jokes that would probably not get unless you had seen the previous movie.I agree whole heartedly that the animation of the Scorpion King at the end what horrible. Very rough graphics and bad likeness for that hunk, the Rock.Still, very happy with the movie. A great addition to the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let down","review":"I love Brendan Frasier, but I did not enjoy this movie at all.

But the sequel left something to be desired.For some reason I thought the special effects were....worse in this movie. Not sure if the same studio created the effects for both films, but this one looked worse (to me). The Scorpion King (with the Rock's face) looks completely unbelievable.Also, the relationship the two \\"parents\\" had with the son was laughable (not in a good way). They didn't even act like they loved him, and he was pretty much in danger the whole last half of the movie. Just shoddy acting.If you want to watch a good mummy movie, do yourself a favor and rent the first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"Excellent idea that probably came from the 1950's attempts to put this kind of movie together. However, our era's special effects makes this movie work wonderfully. Story is pretty good. There are some bumps in the telling of the story, but it all evens out. Good action sequences. Some of the characters you wish were smarter, but overall good job. I have watched it several times and will again in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah man. Another \\"Collector's Edition\\".","review":"Universal is going to release a crummy \\"Collector's Edition\\" DVD and then next year, a ULTIMATE EDITION. The film is probally really good. Just, I probally won't buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top .............. save your money.","review":"Over the top is a great way to describe this garbage. Fans of the first Mummy film (good movie) were no doubt disappointed at how badly the follow up was. Constant useless action seemed to fill up the area where the plot should be. Which brings me to my next point, the plot was WEAK. I'm talking really WEAK.And the whole promotion of the Rock as the Scorpion King was another waste of time. His part lasts a whole 2 minutes. But thats good because he can't act .... at all. The only reason the Scorpion King was even made into a movie was because Vince McMahon headed up the project. For those of you who don't know, McMahon is the owner of the wrestling company the Rock works for.And if you need anymore reasons to skip this, the flying blimp, complete with jet-powered engines, is a perfect example of why NOT to see this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely not Seven Samurai","review":"This is a high speed , special effects driven, tongue in cheek action thriller and a total no brainer. But that doesn't stop it being a huge amount of fun, I love it roll on Mummy 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rock","review":"5,000 years ago, a bad dude known as the Scopian King, played by the WWE (Get the \\"F\\" Out) Superstar, The Rock, wanted to rule the known world. But, he was betrayed by a certain god. We only get to see The Rock for about four minutes.The Year of the Scopian has come. The Scorpian King shall raise again with the armies of the underworld to take over the world. But, The Mummy gets back to life and wants to rule the Earth with the armies of the underworld. The Mummy is the only guy tough enough to take out the Scorpain King."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHILDREN AND /OR BABIES WELCOME TO THIS MOVIE","review":"Here is a movie in the same group where Jurassic park is.Just more colours and more actions. I have not watched the first one however have not lost anything . I do not know why many people love stories full of miracles, and as long as they love them, we realistic logical people will have to suffer from those so-called excellent 'must-see' movies. If you have got nothing to do, have lost your key of your apartment so that have to wait until a family member comes home to open the door, and have seen all the movies around, ok watching it is much better than waiting outside and dying of boredom (I cannot promise this movie is not boredom)."},{"rating":"1","title":"when will Hollywood learn.....","review":"No plot, no credible facts. King Scorpion and Imhotep didn't even live in the same time frame. When will Hollywood learn?!This is a pathetic sequel to the first film, The Mummy (which was much more fun). It is also a film which make several references to older films in some scenes oh! so cliché (the jet airship?!?). The scriptwriters obviously did not care about making any sense when writing this junk. Alex's mother would worry but not the father?!?!?! Oh pleeease. The kid seems to have been, at first, a copy of Ramses Peabody (see the Amelia Peabody series written by Elizabeth Peters); however this dissolves after his meeting with the mummy.A film as full of oh! so phony special effects as possible. Some scenes even look like video games. It is so incredibly gory too.The two stars I give for making me laugh from beginning to end, and for its unbelievable stupidity throughout the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Except for this...","review":"Well, this movie was nice. It had more action, was more funny than \\"The Mummy\\", and was sad because that girl was killed. I keep forgetting her name. Her actress was Rachel something, wasn't it? Either way, this has more action, and you know what. But it seems like Johnathan is the only one that's ten years older. Well ,you have to see this, even though I may have some harsh comments."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie has nothing to do with mummys","review":"The Mummy Returns is about 40 times worse than The 1999 film, The Mummy, which was also horrible. Why movies like this make so much money I don't think I will ever understand. Not only is it bad but it looks like they didn't even try to make it good, the specisl effects are worse than that of Air Force One or The Langoliers. I spit on this movie and its filmmakers, especially you Stephen Sommers, you ruined 4 hours of my life from viewing both of these lumps of dung. This film is the second worst of the year in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGGGH! Save your money!","review":"This is THE WORST movie sequel I have ever seen. It was so terrible that it inspired me to write my first movie review ever on Amazon. Where's my receipt? You might enjoy this flick if you're less than 10 years old AND in possession of a single digit IQ. It's a huge disappointment following the original Mummy flick. I would like to give it a negative star."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for the special effects -2 stars for the kid","review":"I hate that kid. I hate his horrible acting.yes the second film had so much promise but it was ruined by a small kid whose only job was making foolish faces. yes this is a fantsy film and in fantasy films you can find mummies but you can not find rocket boosted zeplins with so small a ballon that can only lift a small cat. and in the end who had killed herself for imhotep run away being afraid to die??? why had her killed herself in the first place? She was the firavun's wife. Well if they will do a third of this movie hope that they will left that kid at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"So the mummy returns?...did we need him to?","review":"I enjoyed THE MUMMY, but before going to see this one I somehow knew it wasn't going to be good. Well, I was right. If you are looking for a movie that will showcase the latest in CGI technology, by all means see it. Just don't look for interesting characters or a good story. The first movie was good. It was one of those movies that in the future if it's on during a lazy Sunday, you will watch it. It had that quality about it. The sequel left me wishing for it be over as I sat in the theater.The story becomes borderline ridiculous and the acting, well, they knew their lines at least. It follows a formula. For example, in the first one we had the crazy biplane pilot, now we have a crazy blimp pilot. It seems to me that the legacy of Ancient Egypt could help a writer create some more interesting aspects to this movie. Well, I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Movie","review":"I went to see this movie twice and each time it got better. This was better than the first one and had better graphics. The only things I didn't like about the movie were those little creatures that were in the woods, the ones that shot the blow darts at the people. It looked too much at first like Jarassic Park, when the Raptors took the people under the weeds in the second one. It just looked really bad. My friend and I were laughing throughout that part! The only other part I didn't like was when The Rock came out at the end as the Squirpion King (I don't know how to spell it LOL). It just looked so fake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"\\"The Mummy Returns\\" is a prime example of everything wrong with big budget Hollywood movies these days: bloated excess, no plot, no character development and absolutely no concern for the intelligence of its audience. Sure, if your a lobotomized squirrel you may find something remotely entertaining in this waste of celluloid. But if you have even a couple of functioning neurons chances are you'll just keep looking at your watch waiting for this thing to end.The first film was fun, this one is merely tedious. The sad thing is, as long as we keep handing the studios are hard earned cash for drivel like this they'll just keep on churning them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BORING!","review":"I rented this movie and watched it with my family and i was seriously having trouble staying awake. THe only thing keeping me awake was the bag of peanut butter cups I ate. It's your basic fight a bunch of monsters kind of movie, all they did was run around fighting dogs with swords (hahaha) and other corny mythical creatures, and solving stupid corny mysteries. It wasn't exciting at all. The storyline was so stupid. The special effects were a pathetic attempt to make the movie look cool. The Rock is a TERRIBLE actor, good thing he wasn't much of a main character and the animation of \\"The Scorpion King\\" at the end was pretty funny. (Are they trying to make it look scary looking or something?) Well, Don't buy this movie. Don't rent it, and don't watch it on TV if it's ever on. What kills me is, they're planning on making another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mummy Returns","review":"The Mummy Returns was a huge disappointment to me a huge fan of the great B movie fun of the first one I was absolutly disappointed by this unimaginative typical hollywood sequel formula shlock designed to seperate you from your money with the least amount of effort.Note to hollywood..special effects AND an intelligent story line are the keys to a good screenplay I already have dim hopes for the third installment yet to hit movie theatres.I would recomend to Mummy Fans save your dollar just go watch the first one again it at least frolicked in its own silliness enough to be fun or go watch Indiana Jones Nuff said..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as the first","review":"This movie was an average movie, but even mor average as a sequel. I would call it a quick hollywood buck. Some of the speical efects are good, but some, such as the scorpian king himself near the end, are very fake and artificial such as a videogame.That said, this is not a horror movie as the title would suggest, but really an action and adventure movie.Overall, I would recommend this movie if you've seen the first one, but if not, I probably wouldn't.<marquee>good overall, but not great</marquee>"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I thought this was an awesome movie. Not only did they keep the main characters from first movie together, but they had better and cooler special effects and tied the this movie together with what happened in the first one. This movie had alot more action in it and more special effects.Also on this DVD is many many special features like interviews with just about everyone and an egyptian type dictionary. This DVD is packed with hours and hours of fun and interesting entertainment.But this DVD and enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Terrible, Awful, Horrid.....","review":"OK, now I'll admit to sort-of liking the first installment, if for no other reason than it was a reasonably entertaining couple of hours.The sequel, however takes \\"suspension of disbelief\\" and throws it off a cliff. I would point out some of the plot holes, but I'm still trying to figure out if there ever really was a plot in the first place. Sure the CGI graphics were interesting, but what's the point?There were what, a quarter million or so members of the 'Medjai' in that valley scene just waiting to go up against the Scorpion King's unholy army? Just take a few riders on a ridge over looking a valley, and paint in CGI replicas until you run out of room in the frame.Oh yeah, the DVD is also chock full of self-serving promo junk like stuff for the Scorpion King movie and some hokey-looking Universal Studios attraction. There's a commentary track, but I don't think I could stand to sit through it again.And the upcoming \\"Scorpion King\\" looks even better....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing compared to the first.","review":"Brendan Fraser, et. al. give it their best try, but with a script this vacuous, a plot this meandering, and some truly bad special effects (the ending), there is only so much you can do.The first movie (1999's \\"The Mummy\\") is a modern classic. \\"The Mummy Returns\\" is a limp retread. I hear there is a third movie in the works, since the first two did so well financially, and I can only hope the franchise returns to the standards of quality and adventure that the first film embodied."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a dissapointment","review":"I'm a big fan of the mummy so I expected that the mummy returns should be even better.

The overwhelming, annoying amount of special effects? (Do you remember the cheesy images of the Scorpion King at the end? What was he doing winking at the camera?) The plot that completely forgets that of the previous 'Mummy' movie? There are many actors in this movie with some great potential that spend the whole movie \\"acting\\" to the special effects? The only thing we are telling the Hollywood studios, by making this movie one of the highest-grossing of the year, is that we want computer special effects to take the place of real acting and story. If we quit wasting our money on terrible movies like this, Hollywood will realize that we are tired of stupid movies like this and start making real films again!I want two hours of my life back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SO VERY STUPID & CGI SATURATED!!!","review":"First off, did all you people see the same stupid & overblown movie I saw? How can any of you say this film is even entertaining to a bus full of cretins? The computer graphics are so overblown that the movie may as well have been a cartoon! Terrible acting, awful & predictable plot, lousy special effects! Too much! A flying pirate ship? Let's leave the supernatural to the mummies & the realistic to the humans.

Summary: AVOID"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mummy Should Not Have Returned!","review":"In an attempt to create a series of movies such as the Indiana Jones series, The Mummy Returns fails to hold its audience. Despite the excellent sound quality of this DVD, the story lacks credibility and the acting is non-existent. Because the movie possesses cheap animation and poor video quality, this DVD suffers as a result.If you are looking for a good sequel to a great film, this is not it. The story jumps from one extreme to the other in an unbelievable, cartoonish quality. Because of the success of the first film, producers raced to complete a sequel that should never have been produced. None of the animation in this DVD compares to the higher quality animation in the first DVD.This DVD is better left on the shelf at the video store or in the bargain bin ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"why have good features for such a bad movie?","review":"i cant believe they're wasting their efforts on such a horrible movie. the first one was not very good either, and they had an ultimate edition 2 disc DVD for it.

But as we have all learned from this past week, terror stirrs us to action. Don't even spend time thinking about spending money on this movie. This movie was almost as bad as Battlefield Earth! Plus, it is in some pre-order competition with the Simpson's Complete 1st season, so don't let the world think that this moivie is even a little good!

So please people, stop womping on it. this movie rocks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thourough enjoyment","review":"I personally don't give a hoot what critics to the negative have to say. I enjoyed the movie because it was just simply fun. It is so rare to find a movie showing love, concern for family and friends, and no explicit language or sex.How can one not like the new talent of Oded Fehr, he is just great in this movie and I want to see more of him. I too was not impressed by the \\"rock\\" simply because they gave him too much credit, but it pulled in the kids and \\"face it\\" the movie did a huge business. For pure enjoyment, just watch it and have fun and don't be so critical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough good action to go around.......","review":"Good action flick. Again, as in the first film, they give Brendan Fraser too many corny lines. But, he was much better this time around.I will not tell the story other than to say that the bad guy is back along with a bunch of his friends. The action goes from the desert to the streets of London back to the desert... There will be a follow up film later this year to expand on \\"The Scorpion King\\" that was introduced here. That should be quite good.The special effects are great! The creatures! Wow! The scenery... Wow!The sound went well with the film. I had the volume relatively high. The sub-woofer was really felt during the action sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIS-AP-POINT-ING","review":"Critics complained a lot about THE MUMMY. They said it was too corny, that the historical facts were inacturate (sp?), and that there were many plot holes. Well, I said \\"tough beans\\" to them because I enjoyed THE MUMMY a lot. Now THE MUMMY RETURNS, that's where I agree with the critics. I was so disappointed with this sequel because the plotline was so vague and so disposable (sp?) that it makes THE MUMMY'S plotline seem solid. It has something to do with some magical braclet that supposed to bring back some Scorpian King...ah, who cares?! I really hope they don't make a third sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"smashing","review":"This movie is just plain pure fun. Yes, a bit scary for little ones, but very little bad language (wow) and no explicit sex scenes. This is a rarity anymore.I esp. liked Oded Fehr. He is very exciting and played his part to perfection. I certainly hope to see much more of him and also hopefully in this type of roll..adventure and excitement. I was also impressed by the way that Rachel changed her character from a bit of a flip to a serious person.Whole movie was a delight and lots of fun...Pooh to critics...we need escapism and this is a good one. Check out Oded people, he is an exciting new talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"London bus scene worth price of admission.","review":"If you like Brendan Fraser, then you will like this movie.

I expected an actionpacked popcorn movie and this is what I got. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effects can't help this disaster","review":"I thought the effects and the extra footage in this movie would redeem it.

I believe the theaters should have pad us to see this one. The first Mummy was OK, but not great. I would have given it two stars at the most. But this one only gets one, and that's because I had to put a star up there. If I had a the option it would have got a big fat goose egg. If you plan on buying The Mummy Returns... please return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"i have seen better 3rd grade plays","review":"I thought this was going to be a good movie, WRONG!!

Imhotep woman is trying to bring him back and the whole world is in risk of being destroyed by evil. Throw in the Rock as the Scorpion King.

Well worth adding to you collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"That was a sequal?","review":"I do have to admit that I enjoyed the first Mummy very much, but I was extremely disappointed in this sequal. It almost completely changes the character development from the first one and the special effects will have you rolling in the isles (quite frankly, I could have done better with an action figure and my home video camera.) Worth seeing once, but there was nothing original about this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it get any worse?","review":"Poor Brandon. He was so close to being the next indiana jones, but this movie crushed him. It was brutally bad, the story line was exactly the same as the first. And could there be anymore mush in it? I mean you get the idea that brandon and his wife love eachother, but every 5 minutes they are gushing with how much they love eachother. Bad, bad, bad movie. And anamakson (I know the spelling is off) could she be any more modern day? She is supposed to be reincarnated and it is a terrible job.

Brendan Fraser? ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mummy Mia!!","review":"Brendan Fraser and Co. are back for a second round with that nasty mummy with twice the adventure, special effects and even a 10 year old son for the two lead characters. While this sequel is lacking some of the charm of the first film, it is still a satisfying \\"summer\\" action film that you can sit back with a tub of popcorn and enjoy. Wrestling star, The Rock, makes a cameo at the beginning of the movie as the Scorpion King, a character whose story helps set the plot in motion. Fans of the WWF star may be disappointed as he is only in the film for 5 minutes or so. The dvd includes several extra features and any fan of the first film will more than likely enjoy this one too. Good film for a boring afternoon or to see with a group of friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh. Should be Zero Stars","review":"The title of the review says it all. This was the worst movie of the year, and one of the few times I ever wished I had walked out of the theater early. Special effects cannot make up for a thin, unbelievable plot. If you are going to set a movie in the real world, nearly a century ago, try and stick with historically accurate props and storylines. A rocket powered blimp just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The only reason I gave this movie two stars is because they spent so much money on special effects that I felt bad just giving it one. This movie is absolutely the worst film I've seen this year. Unless of course you're into weak characters, stupid one liners, and a wise cracking kid that gets more annoying by the minute. It's predictable, and not worth the energy spent sitting through it."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Much LOVE","review":"This movie was definitly not the best of the first two films.

I was totally disappointed by this tea kettle and am returning it today. I love Oxo, but this did not deliver. The handle pushes forward to open the spout, which is a strange way to do it. That movement seems to be what makes it feel very flimsy. The handle actually wiggles back and forth when you pick it up. It doesn't appear to be broken. I think that is just the design. Both my husband and I are waiting for that handle to just fall off one day while we are pouring boiling water. Clearly we aren't waiting for that! Too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kettle we've ever owned, too!","review":"This great kettle is everything you could want! It even comes in a variety of colors. The no-touch, just tilt to pour, handle is a dream. You never need to worry about steam burns. We've had ours for years and the only thing I've ever had to do is tighten a handle screw once after about 5 years of use. It cleans up well, heats quickly and has a whistle you will hear.We boil water in it many times every day and leave it with water in it all the time. We've never seen a speck of rust. Handle stays cool - no need for a potholder to pour your water. LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!!! I'm Melting...","review":"I bought this as one of my mom's Christmas gifts.

I am shocked because OXO usually has great products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nasty Metallic Taste","review":"We will be looking forward to throwing it out because it gives off a nasty metallic taste after heating the water. We thought it was the tap water but it is indeed the kettle. It makes me pretty upset because my wife drinks a few cups of tea everyday and I dont know what kinds of metals/toxins she is ingesting. Please beware. We had a Zojirushi hot water pot that broke during our move across the country. Please check that out...its the way to go although it costs $100+. They are popular in Japan. We will be getting another one and forget about any kind of kettle from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"The spout cover melts during routine use","review":"Don't buy this kettle. I bought one at a store about 8 months ago, and I use it almost every day. I don't do anything careless like leave it on the burner or let it boil dry or anything. I noticed that a couple months ago the plastic spout cover began to melt around the edges and break off. This morning the whole thing cracked in half. I paid 30 bucks plus tax and now I have to go out and get a different kettle.They don't make 'em like they used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient spout lid, superior contruction","review":"I have been using this product for a couple years now, and have been pleased with its performance. The innovative spout lid may take some people a bit of time to get used to (opening by lifting the handle), but it is convenient and well-made. The spout lid can remain open on its own if you want to stop the whistling.The contruction is solid and superior, like for many of the other OXO products. The handle is solidly attached to the body, unlike some other brands I have used where there were screws that came loose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"After just a couple months of use on a gas stove, the plastic cap over the pour spout melted.

But what I would have wanted to know before I made my purchase, is that it is a very regional dialect that is spoken in this cd set (Lebanese, Syrian, Palestinian dialect). Which is fine if that is what you need, but since my husband is Egyptian, I would like to be able to communicate with him and his family in their own dialect. It was actually pretty comical listening to the first cd with him because he kept saying, \\"What? No, we say it this way...\\" until we just turned it off.The Egyptian dialect is also more widely recognized throughout the Arab world since Egyptian movies, music, etc. are a big part of Middle Eastern popular culture - so even if you don't have Egyptian family, I think that it would not make sense to learn the spoken Arabic with this dialect - it's difficult enough already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and simple game.","review":"This is a great game, for four or five people.

This story develops characters with character. It certainly deserves a read from any and all ages. As a former educator, I highly recommend this book for the classroom, for the home and for anyone's personal library.

The Harry Potter readers will certainly enjoy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious espionage actioner","review":"Contrary to the expectation of impressive gadgetry and topnotch thrills, \\"Mission Impossible\\" is a dreary and overcomplicated action thriller. The only incredible thing about it is that almost the entire cast is killed within the first half hour.There are a few powerful action sequences (such as the climax involving the helicopter and the train) but the plot entanglements (with plenty of twists but no surprises) mar what might have otherwise been a good cinematic version of the hit TV series, which, in itself, was never short on suspense or sophistication."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Mm. Truly a poor and silly film. If you took an episode of the old series and drained out everything that was interesting, and replaced it all with cliches, bad dialogue, flat characters, a boring story, and gimmicky, over-the-top \\"plot twists\\" -- you'd have this. There's just nothing remotely good about it -- *except* for the famous scene in which Cruise is suspended in that high-security room trying to retreive -- a disk or something? (It's been a while.) This one scene -- is very good. Crafty, suspenseful, and quite well edited from what I remember. If you decide to rent this movie (god forbid you *buy* it!) -- I would recommend fast-forwarding until you reach this scene, watching it, and then moving on, to spend the remainder of your day or evening in a more productive and enriching fashion. You might want to take a peek at the climax action sequence too, it's fairly original (although WAY over-the-top) and pretty to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid people won't like this movie","review":"This is a very good movie. It's like a good piece of art, which at the time of viewing is very good. However after the viewing is done, there is not much one takes away from the movie. This movie relies a lot on suspense and emotion. It's very stylishly made, and it's excellent to watch in suspense.IT's obviously much better in terms of plot and style than the farce of a movie directed by the overrated Jhon Woo. (trust me, he's a very typcial asian director, just because you haven't seen others doesn't mean there aren't any.) Remember Mission impossible is supposed to be a team movie, as is the first one. Not a trashy one man circus like it's sequal.Watch this movie, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Impossible (HD-DVD)","review":"I'm a fan of Mission Impossible movies.

Brian De Palma directed it! De Palma is a master visualist and this movie looks like none other. De Palma makes complete use of depth within the frame and his visual style is unmatched by any director working today (Scorsese being the exception) so this film (unlike MI2) holds up and is still interesting & riveting after repeated viewings. MI2 is a stupid, cliched plot with lotsa action and explosions I have already seen. This one really makes you think when you watch it and the way the spy/action/suspense scenes are directed & handled are wonderful. Also, a great script from David Koepp & the legendary Robert Towne"},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost-excellent action film...","review":"\\"Mission: Impossible\\" is a nearly perfect film. If it weren't so darn confusing at times, it would be an absolutely wonderful movie. However, it boggles itself down with too much dialogue and confusing plot twists. But it's no doubt a highly-enjoyable movie. Tom Cruise is Ethan Hunt, a secret agent who has been betrayed and now must prove his innocence. This is the most of the plot of which we know for sure. The other details are too complicated to really understand, but they don't matter. What matters is the constantly suspenseful moments including the beginning where Hunt and team are chasing after a bad guy to the heist Hunt makes in the CIA building to the incredible helicopter-chasing-the-train sequence that makes up the film's climax. There's much to enjoy in this movie and, if you watch it a few times, it even begins to make sense. I highly recommend it to any action fan who doesn't mind thinking every now and then. It's a superb action flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission impossible is fantastic","review":"Most movies in this catagory go like this, Bad guy trys to take over or destroy something, Good guy stops Bad guy, Good guy gets girl, the end.Mission Impossible takes a very different approach, and it works!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising & thrilling","review":"it was a really good movie. it really keeps you on the egde of your seat. the ending is quite surprising. the movie was action packed and pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Mission is Impossible for AMAZON","review":"Great movie and fantastic quality.

Then they obviously didn't watch the movie, and have no clue as to how the real spy world works. Sure, the plot may not involve the destruction of an entire city (\\"Goldeneye\\"), but rather, the plot is much more clandestine, which makes for a better spy film anyway. Cruise, unlike the other people say, did a remarkable job acting, and had a good supporting cast. There is very good action and suspense. (Ok, the tunnel scene at the end is questionable on the reality scale, but it made for a good movie.) The music in the film is very fitting and suspenseful. \\"Mission: Impossible\\" never gets old. It's complicated, and is a very \\"real\\" spy movie, unlike James Bond and the rest. In reality, it compliments the TV series very well. I just hope the sequal is just as good, if not better. Buy it - trust me, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action film !","review":"With the sequel realeased at thre moment, this is a must be watched movie. If you like action movies with great effects and storline you will love this movie, Tom Cruise fits the role like a glove, if you like James Bond, secret agent movies as I do then I would say this is one of the best non-bond movies around. The story line invloves Tom Cruise as typical secret agent on a mission, suddenly the mission goes wrong and all his team get wiped out, Tom is accused of sabotaging the mission and needs to find out what really happend. This is an ideal opening to a superb mystery action film. If the sequel comes close to its predecessor then your in for another thrill ride.

Tom Cruise stumbles about the movie, going from place to place. Why? NOBODY KNOWS! The plot twisted and turned more that a snake stuck in a cement truck drum. Why does Ethan Hunt hang himself from a wire a few inches above a sensor-rigged floor? NOBODY KNOWS! Why is Mr. Phelps throwing fake blood around? NOBODY KNOWS! This movie should have been scrapped. It's Impossible that a movie could be this horrible. Best thing to come out of it was the theme song."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst movie of the decade!","review":"This movie broke down on numerous occasions into the realm of the unbelievable. Even fantasy and sci-fi movies present ideas and events in a way that the audience can accept as logical for the story. But Mission Impossible contains scenes that are stupid, illogical, unnecessary, and unrealistic.Why would a man who is a genius and the mastermind of the MI Force betray his country and his friends for a mere million dollars when he could easily obtain it legally? Why would this man turn his back on his enemy to kill his friend? How could a man survive a helicopter explosion while traveling at high speed in a tunnel?This is not just a bad movie, it is an insult to all fans of the TV series. Obviously the producers did not care about that. They are only after a quick buck from the name recognition. This is SHAMEFUL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's impossible to not like this movie","review":"\\"Mission Impossible\\" is one cool movie. It's a movie forA. Those who like non stop actionB.

Tom Cruise lovers, This is one the better Tom Cruise movies, and it's also a good movie for those who like Ving Rhames, and Jon Voight, they both played great roles in this movie as well.This truly is a good movie, and for all the action in it, you will notice very little if any language, and no nudity or sexual refrences.

Having said that, why make a film and call it Mission Impossible then make it so that it is the exact opposite of the TV series.

It is no wonder Peter Graves wanted nothing to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red light, green light!","review":"This is a picture that pitifully, promises much more than what it gives. At the end, when you sum, you feel something didn't fit, despite the frenetic narrative rhythm.Visually the film is stunning, plenty of action, but the script is extremely weak, the dominant presence of Cruise along the film, shadows the ominous presence of figures as Jon Voight, Scott Thomas, Jean Reno and Vanessa Redgrave who are pitifully wasted in insipid lines.To win in a thriller you have to think in the evilness of the characters too. It is not enough to shine with bit nails sequences. I mean; there is a balance problem in the dramatic environment. And the presence of the enemy is so diminished that it is reduced to a simple cartoon.The final sequence crossed the line of the credibility to convert itself in a funny joke.That's what it happens when you loss the dramatic equilibrium and the abuse of the special effects domains the balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.

Seems a high rating for a movie that generally has had a somewhat mediocre reception. I rated M.I. accordingly because it's a movie I have revisited on quite a few occasions and have always thoroughly enjoyed it. Tom Cruise is a very talented actor, but it is the twisting story-line, exciting climatic action sequence and theft of the NOC list scene from the CIA that sends this movie into my 5 star rating category. The DVD version I have, has no special features, aside from a theatrical trailer. If I were rating this on the DVD itself then it would certainly rate very low. All in all, a favourite movie of mine, with action, suspense, espionage and a twist. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax, it's worse than you think.","review":"overall i really enjoy this film. i went in thinking this was going to be just another run of the mill action film. i was pleasantly surprised. sure the movie has some faults and a couple of plot twist were not that great. but overall i enjoyed it. i thought there was some very clever ideas in this film and the low body count was unusual for a action film. the effects are quite good and the sound not bad. the dvd could have used some extras. but many dvd's released by this company have next to nothing on them. definitly worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who?

Instead of giving everything away upfront, they handed it to you piece by piece. I felt that this was true-to-form of the original series.What ruined it was the lame effort to transfer the movie to DVD. Paramount has a problem of grabbing all the money on the latest fads without giving any concerns as to what the fans want. All they did was provide you with a couple of screen formats, a few audio a caption options, and a copy of the movie trailer.

He is aided by different people all the way, and like the best James Bond movies, can't trust anyone completely, for they may be in on it.

They're all real people, no all black or all white characters. The plot is not cut and dried. The guards, the prisoners, the families, the lawyers all are very human and it's not always easy to decide whose side you should be on, despite how you feel. Things are done very differently than they would be in an American prison. But that's not the story. The story is about a woman in prison for a crime she may or may not have committed and her desperation to keep her son with her.

As other reviewers have stated, the vinyl release is a rollercoaster ride of musical style that can be unnerving, but all of the pieces are amazing in their own way. This is some of WINGS best music ever, making it easy to forgive the track layout. Programming this CD to best suit your taste is recommended. Rock fans should select \\"Spin it On\\", \\"Old Siam, Sir\\", \\"Rockestra Theme\\", & \\"So Glad to See You Here\\". Softer music lovers would prefer \\"Getting Closer\\", \\"We're Open Tonight\\", & \\"Arrow Through Me\\". The remaining pieces are also of varying interest.

I listened to it back during that time and particulary liked the songs \\"Getting Closer\\" and \\"Arrow Through Me\\" (that latter was used in a Benji/Chevy Chase movie-seriously). But then came more serious McCartney works --the experimental McCartney II, the sublime Tug of War and quickly this album was pushed to the rear of my collection. In recent years, I have rediscovered it and now view it as McCartney's \\"lost album.\\" Even Paul has dissed this album but the songs have a clarity and attitude that make more sense to me know 20 years down the road. Okay, I still don't know what the heck he means by \\"I'm getting closer, my salamander\\" but gee it sounds so good. This is a McCartney junk-food album, many people don't like to admit that they like it but it sure does sound good and what a voice!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've never understood the negativity associated with this album.

The overall reviews from critics are not great, but I beg to differ. When I first put the needle on the vinyl I just loved the bass line to \\"Reception\\". The album in my opinion is a sleeper to the public. At a glance it doesn't contain any known hits, outside of \\"Arrow Through Me\\" Although, it's filled with great tunes; and \\"Rockestra Theme\\" is filled with great rockers such as Pete Townshend, David Gilmour, and John Bonham. In my opinion it encompasses McCartney as a rocker and balladeer. I'm definately buying it on CD with the extra tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egg on his face","review":"Good God this is a bloody awful album! This was Paul trying to \\"punk\\" up his image after Goodnight Tonight in 1979 but he fails miserably. The lyrics are awful . His Baby's Request is typical of Macca's love for pseudo-1930's English nostalgia. Arrow Through Me and Denny Laine's patronizing Again and Again and Again (\\"you don't want to be the little woman...\\" - please!) are bore you to the point of suicide. His hiring every rock dinosaur alive in '79 to play on Rockestra is Macca embarking on another huge ego trip And just what the heck is the band looking at on the cover?On the original vinyl album side A was Sunny Side Up and side B was Over Easy -- get it? That seemed to be closest to originality and wit this album ever got. But with the CD version on one disk, even that was lost. Best track - Spin it On.

Right on, Paul! BACK TO THE EGG's CD bonus tracks include the great flip-side \\"Daytime Nighttime Suffering\\" and the now-holiday standard, \\"Wonderful Christmas Time,\\" adding value.

He explores every branch of the musical tree and has silenced his critics by doing each style in his own inimitable way.EGG has some great moments that overshadow a couple ventures into mediocrity.Highlights for me: ARROW THROUGH ME, a smartly arranged funk tune that's one of my favorite Wings efforts; the pop smoothness of GETTING CLOSER; the star-laden instrumental ROCKESTRA THEME; the two melodic medleys AFTER THE BALL/MILLION MILES and WINTER ROSE/LOVE AWAKE; the driving DAYTIME NIGHTTIME SUFFERING.

The same applies to song #6, \\"Laeknishendr\\". If I'm keeping count correctly, this is the 3rd time this song gets re-recorded. The rest of the compositions show the majesty of clean vocals if used the right way, along with choir chanting, giving an aura of mental landscapes Viking era-Bathory like in the song \\"Heralder\\".

Ironically, the only song to \\"Make It Big\\" (pun intended), was the one where George did a guest vocal appearance.

This track reached the top 10 on the BBC charts; strangely enough however, this song was never released over on our side of the pond. Two New York radio stations, Z100, played it once in 1987 or 1988, and then again on WPLJ around 1995; otherwise I've never heard it since. To sum up, this CD is quite dull.

I must admit to finding the spanking scene a bit odd for a children's book but my daughter didn't seem to think anything of it. And no, she has never experienced anything like that herself.

I disliked the book primarily because the heroine is violent, selfish, and a potty mouth. The author tried to substitute money for class and failed. Except for being good in bed and a fashion snob (if that counts), she has no redeeming qualities. And the hero? Eh, there was soo much potential, most of it unrealized. He really didn't DO anything, everyone else did things around him that he reacted to. He didn't do the kidnapping, he never stood up to the heroine but let her walk all over him, and he couldn't even rescue himself.The action and pace were really good, if a bit random, and really good sex scenes. But that wasn't enough to make me enjoy a story about a low class witch and her doormat hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mindless, outrageous fun...","review":"The heroine's over the top, kooky, and violent, but the author makes it fun.

Jeff Weigand has his family and career destroyed when he revelas corperate dirt on big tabacco.But what makes the film so incredible is that it is in fact charactor driven, not just moved ahead by story. The cerebral, family oritented yet emotional Wiegand-Russel Crowe-is contrasted with the hip, radical 60 Minutes Producer Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pachino.Both charactors dig their heals into their positions, and watcing these two passionate but extremely bright guys in give and take is simply incredible to watch.The acting is incredible. Both men want, often, conflicting things--Wiegand some shred of privacy and protection, Bergman his story and all he needs to know to protect Wiegand.The subtance of the tobacco litigation is interesting. But the drives of both men--and how smartly this is discussed-is what makes the Insider a cut above most whistle blower movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a Great Film...","review":"The Insider is so engrossing that you forget that it's two and a half hours. Russell Crowe is the future of film, he gives an amazing performance as Jeff Wigant. Pacino gives another stellar performance and Michael Mann's direction is superb. This film is so intense you do not want to stop watching it, even for a minute. It is scary how much money big tobacco has and to what lengths the tobacco industries will go to keep inside information quiet. I find it unbelievable that this actually happened and even more unbelievable that CBS buckled to the pressure of big tobacco's threats. This is scary stuff, buy it, it is well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Al Pacino and Michael Mann strike back!","review":"The team from \\"Heat\\" (1995) strike back with an extraordinary piece that tackles on the issues of tobacco and the power of media. Important decisions are made, sometimes not too ethically, putting the whole issue of media objectivity and transparency in the spotlight.As for Mann, his shots, sometimes stressing due to their closeness and speed, sometimes soothing due to their slow motion, deliver the message loud and clear.Pacino's acting brings no new surprises: he's awesome once again! You'll recall in particular, when you see it, the scene where he delivers his lines to 60 Minutes's anchor, Mike Wallace, Don Hewitt (CBS Senior Exec. Producer) and CBS News president. He'll move you with his force and the passion he puts to accomplish his mission in the movie (which I don't want to spoil).Simply put: one of 1999's best movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the top three best of '99","review":"\\"The Insider\\" was the first great film I had seen at the movies last year and I had to wait until practically the very end of the year to see one. Russell Crowe gave the preformance of a lifetime as the title character and the real-life hero Jeffrey Wigand and won an Oscar nod for his work. He is certainly my favorite contemporary and one of the most believable actors to come around in a long time. Al Pacino although given top billing was somewhat shoved into the background when the reviews appeared in the papers and on tv but Christopher Plummer was given the worst shaft of all when he didn't get an Oscar nomination as supporting actor for his brilliant portrayal of \\"60 Minutes\\" giant Mike Wallace. The film is easily one of my three favorite films of '99 (second only to \\"American Beauty\\" and followed by \\"The Green Mile\\"). See it and you will not be sorry in the least. It is a great film with a stellar cast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pacino and Crowe deliver","review":"\\"The Insider\\" focuses on Jeffrey Wigand. He is an ex research scientist from the Brown & Williamson tobacco plant. The reason he is fired, is because he finds out that the company has placed some illegal substances in their products.Lowell Bergman, a representative from 60 minutes catches wind of this and wants Jeffrey to give an interview on 60 minutes, describing what wrong Brown & Williamson company have done.Without giving out any more spoilers, I can't say much more about the plot.What makes this film truly an epic film is the wonderful acting by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino gives what is truly an Oscar worthy performance.I highly recommend \\"The Insider\\" as it is not a simple film by any means, it requires you to think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very successful","review":"It was just pure coincidence that I re-watched LA Confidential two days before I watched The Insider.

I wish Michael Mann would do a film of this book. It also shows a whistleblower and moral dilemmas, but in an area of even greater importance: the federal government and 9/11.

Thanks for the exceptional value and speed of delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lengthy, but with healthy intentions","review":"A slightly overlengthed film hailed for Russell Crowe's performance should actually be hailed for a few other things; first off, both Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer are magnificent here. Secondly, the cinematography is breaktaking and beautiful, with its vivid use of color, high contrast levels, and focus-changing shots within a small depth of field, perfectly matching the harmonic vocals that complement the movie's poignant score. Lastly, the film's conclusion, with the plot's full Sixty Minutes interview actually airing on television to audiences everywhere with the anti-Tobacco Industry interview, more than makes up for the film's overlength (a trend in 1999, with \\"The Green Mile\\" and \\"Magnolia\\" each lasting over three hours); the ending is addictively gratifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Insider","review":"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!Trust me, you're gonna love this movie.

In all of his films - and even his lone dip into tv, 'Miami Vice,' - Mann successfully captures that feeling of the routine, of driving home after a long workday, of sitting down to dinner with the kids. It is that realism sprinkled over every frame of this movie that makes it so enthralling. There is no Hollywood-ending here. In 'The Insider,' words and actions have consequences, sometimes dire. Marriages dissolve. Lawsuits are filed. Jobs are lost. (you get the picture). All of that adds to the depth of our protagonist, Mr. Gladiator himself Russell Crowe, whose intensity in this film is palpable. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the editor?!?!","review":"Ok, this movie is about 1.5 hours longer than it should have been... Did they forget to hire an editor?It starts out ok, but the whole thing just kinda strains at the end, until it gets to be like a neverending broken record. The make up jobs are weird as well. It seems like Russell Crowe never fully underwent his \\"aging\\" transformation. Yeah, he has on a grey wig, but his face is that of a relatively young person. Besides that, Al Pacino, who is like 15 years older than him in real life, looks 20 years younger than Crowe in the movie.It's an OK movie, but nothing special...

Second when you say Al Pacino, we remember his greatests \\"Heat\\" or \\"Devil's Advocate\\". So this movie does not easily fit with many of his great movies.So the success of this movie is no more determined by the actors past successful history, but only if the story is good or not. And yes the story was good and had its certain type of suspense but it gets in a frame that we all knew about this story and now it has got out.In other words, we always believed that smoking cigarettes is an addiction.

If I had known this, I would never have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better.","review":"'The Insider' could have been a much better movie than it actually turned out to be. One of the main problems with the film is we don't know anything about the Russel Crow's character or his family. They were poorly developed and that really hurts the movie. We don't know why Jeff has the emotional problems he has or why his wife seems like she is going to vomit in every other scene.What is also really annoying is how the 'The Insider' was filmed.Do we really need to see extreme close-ups of the characters' faces from five different angles? What purpose does this type of directing serve? Al Pacino did a fine job as always, but even he couldn't save this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"American Beauty deserved the oscar, but that's not to say that The Insider isn't a good movie. Rather I'd list it as number 2 of the nominees, and for good reason - it's an amazing film. Both Crowe and Pacino deliver wonderful performances, and the story is an interesting critique on the role of the media and the problems with big business. If I have any complaint of this film, it would be its subjective nature, but that's to be expected from any film.The Insider is one of the best films of the year, just behind Fight Club and American Beauty.See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"This is a true story about an ex-Tobacco executive who is cohersed into revealing secrets from his job.

I heard right as it is now my favorite film from Mann, the story is based on fact about one man who dared to go against the tobacoo company and lost everything because of it. One of the films many strengths are the superb performances by Crowe and Pacino(Duh), they seem as though they could be the actual people who went through the ordeals of all this. Half docudrama half psychological thriller this is a fantastic film not to be missed! My rating 9.5/10."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of few truth in making","review":"Very few movies show the truth.

The praise doesn't stop there, Al Pacino is in this movie, and he's always great, and this movie was directed by Michael Mann, the same director of Heat (with Al Pacino, and the wife...) which was also an excellent movie. A friend told me he didn't want to see this movie because it was about smoking. It is certainly not about smoking I told him. It's so much more than simply \\"about smoking\\".

I swallowed every scene like it was water, twitched at every misfortune that fell upon its characters. Both Pacino and Crowe are extraordinarily convincing and compelling, and for us to sit there and hear their their frantic attempts to resolve their problem is like sitting in cold water, or boiling water.

There were some great movies released in 1999, but as far as what movie had the most balls, for me it's a toss-up between Michael Mann's meticulously crafted \\"The Insider\\" and \\"South Park\\". Personally, I see this movie as an indictment of all corporations, be it Big Tobacco or the CBS Television Network. It's up to strong-minded individuals like the Al Pacino character to keep these bastards in check."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not that you need another opinion....","review":"...but I enjoyed this film enough to write about it. The things I liked most about the film were the characters, and the tension. Al Pacino (as Lowell Berghman) and Russell Crowe (as Jeffery Wigand) were terrific. There protrayals were heartfelt and believeable. The woman who played Wigand's wife was weak, but in some sense she was good because you started to hate her for her lack of virtue. As for the tension, throughout nearly the entire film there is this palpable feeling that someone is going to be knocked off, or something is going to pop onto the screen to make you jump. The odd thing is that very little actually happens in the film (you could probably summarize it in 10 sentences), but you're gripped all the way through. My only complaint is that it was a bit too long. After 2:30+ it starts to get a little dull, and the tension isn't enough to keep you glued to the seat.

It gets one star because I HAVE to give it at least one star, there's no option for '0 star'.I am a huge U2 fan, but the music was downright dull. It all sounded like the same song over and over again, and as the person I was watching the movie with stated, it was filled with Bono's masturbatory musical moments (ie. unnecessary musical vignettes during a scene, lyrics that were dour, dull and pretty much unrelated to the action, etc.)I am a HUGE Mel Gibson fan, and love Jimmy Smits, but both of their performances were mediocre, at best. It surely had more to do with an uninspired (and uninspiring) script than any shortcomings of theirs.I won't give away the big mystery behind Mel's neck brace, but it was the most ridiculous plot twist (if you could call it that?!?)

Although this film might not be for everyone, because it is based mostly on dialogue, it is a nice film to see if you are bored with all the BIG Hollywood film movies. If any one enjoyed this movie as much as I did, I am sure you would enjoy films such as The Man Who Cried, The Princess and the Warrior(German)or Run,Lola,Run.In addition- Tom Tom played by Jeremy Davies is an incredible character along with Eloise played by Milla Jovovich. Also the sountrack rocks!

It's a shame that a quallity name such as Mel Gibson would allow himself to be associated with this mess. Gibson is a disabled dictective investagating a murder (or suicide) in a hotel of \\"artists\\". \\"Artist\\" has always been a polite word for LOOSER and the characters in this hotel prove that! The viewer is not always sure what's going on but after a while doesn't care! However, Euro trash loved this movie and it won an award at some Micky-Mouse film festival in Germany!

In fact this is the first time I ever did in probably 25 years. After almost a very excruciating hour I just couldn't take it any longer. This is one of those movies where everyone wants to pretend to see a deeper meaning than what it really is. I enjoy independent films and films that move away from main stream Hollywood. However, this was pure garbage. Some guy narrates this movie with unyielding rhetoric only to finally jump off the roof. Mel Gibson couldn't save this movie, he was just as bad as the rest of the characters. I would give negative stars to this movie if I could.

In this case, I am the beholder and I say that this movie is garbage, even for Mel Gibson, who is a wonderful actor. I feel the same way about this movie as I did about Pulp Fiction and Taxi Driver. This movie was... The plot was dumb. The ending was dumb. The characters and acting were ridiculous and .... well I dunno!

I think that 'passengers' is a better soundtrack like miss Sarajevo which is really a monotonous song, but bono and the lads breath live and power into what would normally be a sub-B side song. But satellite of love isn't up to snuff there are better versions of this song.An odd film to be sure but are crazy people really that virtupus, and do they really see things saner than we do?

The main character mumbles throught the film. \\"nutters\\" are all portrayed as people scratching their heads whilst staring at the floor with a pained expression all their other attributes are copied off crazys portrayed in other films (Brad Pitt-12 monkeys for example). It tries SO hard to be original and clever and fails on both counts. There are a couple of humorous lines in it but thats it. The DVD commentary is equally dull. Highlights include Bono pointing HIMSELF out when the credits roll. The interviews seem like an extension of the film. The cast, director and co writer (Bono) are SOO intense. They take the film SOO seriously. Mel Gibson says of his character, a cop \\"hes investigating a case and he doesnt ask any questions\\" this sentence is followed by an embarrased confused look.

I can't get enough of the ambiant forces Wenders brought to this cautionary tale of life on the down and out in America.Mel Gibson's role as Special Agent Skinner is a hoot and it has been remarked that he goofed his way through this one. So what? Wenders has been lambasted for the ad hoc feel of the film, on the one hand, and for the obsessive stylistic effects of the digital edit, on the other hand. Again, so what?Milla Jovovich is a pleasure to watch, as she flits about, and Jeremy Davies, as agitated nerd, is a mannered play on the fidgeting fool well-loved by Shakespeareans the world round.There are numerous sendups in this piece - e.g. the John Lennon impersonations (Peter Stormare) or the swipes at Schnabel by Schnabel (via the tar paintings) - but overall there is a shimmering, magic aura around this film that won't go away.And, O that soundtrack! by Eno, Lanois, Bono et alia ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreams and Hopes","review":"I have seen \\"The Million Dollar Hotel\\" in a German movie theater. The German producer Wim Wenders and frontman Bono from U 2 are the two men who created this movie. It is a romantic thriller which plays in downtown Los Angeles in the year 2001. The junkie Izzy Goldkiss, son of a media mogul, is found dead. FBI Agent Skinner (Mel Gibson) starts his investigation in the hotel, where Izzy had lived. The hotel is a shelter for the poor with no medical insurance. The prostitute Eloise (Milla Jovovich) and the dreamer Tom Tom (Jeremy Davies) are only two of the people who Skinner is questioning. It is a story about friendship, trust, betrayal and the powerful strength of an unconditional love in front of a criminal investigation ... and at the end even Skinner does not know who is guilty or not guilty, insane or not insane. Great movie, unfortunately not played in every movie theater in the United States. Not available on VHS or DVD yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy Waters","review":"Appearently, the classic observation that German poets muddy the waters to make them appear deep applies to film directors as well. Basicly a silly movie for those who fancy themselves sophisticated intellectuals in need of their periodic euro-film-fix.

Films such as Wings of desire and Paris, Texas were so beautiful that changed cinema history. But nowadays, the truth is a bit different. Wenders has no more that feeling he used to. And so he makes a films like this The Million ... I don't know what's more problematic, if it is the confusing and boring screenplay or the burocratic direction. Anyway, the result is sad. Nothing seems to work here. Even the soundtrack is so boring. Only two songs save (The ground beneath her feet and Falling at your feet). Now, I think nobody is the same. Wenders un-learned how to direct and Bono forget how to sing... By the way, it was too much for him write a song, so how could he dare to write a story for a film? To sum up, it is sad to see how bad is the entertainment world is going... No good films or even songs..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shower head by far","review":"I am delighted with the purchase of this shower head. We have used it for over 6 months.

This works, highly recommend.NOTE: Shower head is bit difficult to get off at first...I used some rubber gloves and it finally came off. Also, the filter is hard to get out also, but again, if you get something to grab it with (plyers may work too), it will come out...I even take the whole shower thing apart on both ends and poke the filter with a pen from the underside and it pops right out.Great filter to filter nasty chlorine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"broke down after first use","review":"I was really impressed with the reviews I had read and decided to give it a try.

I found the results of epilating to be very comparable to those of waxing - the most marked difference is the cost! Waxing, even with at-home kits, quickly becomes a pricey (and messy) venture and in salons, forgetaboutit! This epilator costs less than one trip to the salon, provides equally fine results. Also, that it does a superior job on those \\"more sensitive\\" areas with coarser hair than on the legs. If you are prone to ingrown hairs I highly recommend making use of the loofah and \\"bump patrol after shave intensive treatment\\", a gentleman's shaving product designed to treat and prevent facial razor bumps and ingrown hairs (it's cheaper than \\"tend skin\\" and works better than \\"bikini zone\\" .

In the products defense, I don't think there is a way to make this device easy to use and leg friendly (God forbid you try it anywhere else, ladies!!).

I did end up liking it once I got through my first session with it. I will give some advice though. The first use hurts INCREDIBLY!!! That being said, subsequent uses are far less painful. I was prepared from the reviews of others that the Epilator does not remove every hair the way shaving does. I cannot stress this enough. You need to go over the surface multiple times. Also, this skin irritation isn't so bad as long as you keep up with the exfoliating. I would like to say I have retired my razor all together, but I still use it probably once a week or so for a clean up. All in all, the epilator is a good product, once you get the hang of using it. You do need to allow extra time, but I feel you gain that time back with less shaving in the shower. I've only been using it for a month or so. So far, I feel it was a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco HP2843 Epilator","review":"This was a terrible product.

I did not know Norelco is a part of Philips, so it took time to find this one.This is almost same with the one I had. Does not need any more fancy technology, this is just enough for the purpose. From the experience of more than 10 years, this is the best method to keep smooth legs if you cannot afford laser hair removal all over your body.However, Using this machine is NOT painless procedure for first couple of rounds. If you have just kept shaving your legs, the more expensive models have some feature to reduce pain. If you do waxing, you must have used to pain. This model is good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine...","review":"The epilator works fine and the price says it all.

Think about the first plane built or the first car, the first train, the first computer, MP3 players that stops working in a week, umbrellas that flip in the wind... Maybe people don't die when these things break, maybe they do... but this has always been how technology develops---it improves over time.The title of the book suggests that things built by God do not fail, wrong!

Now we have seen the shuttle Columbia break up, as a result of NASA slowly forgetting the Challenger lessons.With that problem so noted, I still strongly recommend this book as a great read if you want to find out what the business of failure analysis is.

This book once again puts women in the position of being a victim. Montgomery writes about ways to compensate because we are women, which is to make us victims or to say we are otherwise handicapped and need special considerations. We aren't. And we don't. I was disappointed in Montgomery's book. There are some traits women have accepted as fact down through the years that are not inherent, just learned behavior. I was hoping Montgomery's book would identify some of those traits and talk about how to overcome them, not justify their continued use. I will not recommend this book to anyone. Which is sad because I want to support the efforts any woman makes to get a handle on this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other Translations?","review":"I have to believe there is a better translation out there. I've only seen one other though, so I suppose I can merely HOPE there is another. The Maguire-Malmstad version seems hopelessly clunky on the sentence level. I can imagine Bely's novel reads like this in Russian as well, but again, I HOPE it does not!I can't say this story has quite as much \\"human\\" interest as Ulysses, a book that can easily be appreciated apart from its experimental nature. Bely's book is more obscure in those terms. Sort of a cross, perhaps, between Ulysses and Musil's Man Without Qualities (probably a lot more like the latter in the way the characters are presented). Certainly only for people who like \\"experimental\\" writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"I was asked by Amazon to review this purchased book.

And never painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate to Say It: I Didn't find Bely's \\"Masterpiece\\" Any Good","review":"I'm sorry, but I apparently disagree with Nabokov. While an interesting read, \\"Petersburg\\" is confusing to the point of absurdity (not in a good way) and ultimately not very enlighting. When thought of in the context of the Revolution of 1905, Bely's occult beliefs, etc., the novel is slightly more interesting but still not worth the time and mental effort required to read it. Some might say I'm missing something, but I would say their looking too hard.

It Dies Today was a brutal metalcore band and they had a unique sound to them. Now, the singer has lost all the brutality in is voice. And without that brutality, this album has nothing to let itself stick out. I honestly enjoyed the first two song a little bit. But then, it got boring. There were no masterful bridges or really butt-kicking guitar riffs. \\"Bridges Left Burning\\" is my favorite song from them because it has one of the best endings I have ever heard in a song. This new album has absolutely nothing like that. It's become formulaic and that's why it's boring.I honestly don't understand what happened. I really enjoyed \\"The Caitiff Choir.\\" Now, I can take change in music. I understand completely if they change their style a little bit. But they just lost everything I loved about It Dies Today in this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"nonononononononononononononono","review":"This band used to be exactly what I was looking for; amazing riffs, brutal breakdowns, and heartfelt lyrics. Now, all I see is a band just trying to cash in on what used to be an underground scene. Too many bands (Atreyu, All That Remains, Eighteen Visions...) are taking hardcore to the mainstream, but that is not a good thing! I used to love what hardcore was about, and I wouldn't mind the change if it wasn't so crappy! All I see in this cd is a once great band's sad attempt to gain control over a dying scene. If you want my advice, don't waste your time or money on this radio-friendly opus. It makes me sad, thinking about how many people think this is real metalcore. Wake up people! Pop-core is taking over, and most people can't tell the difference between the two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is crap","review":"terrible cd, it dies today have completely changed their image and sound, dont waste your money. if you absolutely have to have it, download it and if you still feel like supporting them then buy forever scorned but otherwise, screw this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Do it Again!!","review":"I Cant get over how awesome this band is they come back with a great fallow up to The Cathiff Choir..Sirens is an awesome album from start to finish and it has everything That you have come to love from it dies today..Brutal music yet melodic the only thing different is that..sirens is alot more melodic than the TCC..But its not bad cause Nick just knows where to throw in those melodies so the songs come out RAD!..this a must have for any IDT fans..i gave it 4 stars cause even though its such a good album..i like the last one better..but its just my opinion..and what i like..And Nick Brooks went out with a bang this is the last album with him as the singer..it sucks that he is no longer in the band..cause the new guy is just not as good..Check it out.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corey Feldman Must be Stopped.","review":"Worst movie ever made.

It is an excellent volume to tie the many facets together."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Language programs compare","review":"I've used Pimsleur and Oasis Audio (AKA The Complete Idiot's Guide)and I find The Living Language program best for my style of learning. The others are based almost exclusively on aural learning, with extremely limited grammatical explanation, in most cases none at all. This replicates the way a child learns his first language, and may well work for some adults, but I need to know what a word \\"looks like\\" and I need to understand the logic behind a construction. Living Language combines written explanation and oral illustration very nicely. The advanced version, both French and Spanish, is very idiomatic and requires a good grasp of the material in the Beginner/Intermediate level. Because these programs contain both a book and CDs, they may be more expensive than some of the others, but they contain an awful lot of material. If you're new to the language, you could easily spend a year on the Beginner/Intermediate program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Wrong Here","review":"Bought the book for about $15 from Amazon, not paying too close attention to the details. Reviews are glowing and give one the impression that the book comes with CD or CDs. (I said I didn't pay attention.) I was waiting eagerly - heading for France next year and would like to be able to find my way around without resorting to mime. So the book has arrived and not only are no CDs included, they are available on Amazon for $190 additional!?!????!!! I'm trying to think of some cute little joke to make about it, but sorry, it doesn't seem funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwhelmingly Difficult!","review":"When I put in the first disc for Beginning French, I thought I had put in the wrong one. The first CD starts by speaking in full sentences with no English. They speak so quickly and unless one is familiar with the language, you will be lost. Absolutely of NO use if you are trying to listen in your car. I did sit down with the book but the CD does not tell you where on the page it is and they skip around. By the time you find your place, they are somewhere else. I found it to be very frustrating. I have learned Italian pretty well before a trip to Italy, using a different program. But I could not learn French from this program and can not recommend it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"It's just another language learning book.

Sorry, I wanted so much to enjoy this book that does, indeed, capture the ambience of New Mexico. But it just did not do it for me. The problem was that I could not find myself realy caring whether they found Bobby, or, as whining Rachel would insist, Roberto. I respect the authors for a good try and hope they keep at it. However, this one didn't make the grade for me. When I discovered my Amazon-purchased copy jumped from page 217 t0 247, the ommision did not irritate me, even though I think those pages clued the reader on Bobby's fate."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get published?","review":"That so much sturm and drang occurs in the first 10 pages is amazing. It's also hard to believe that there really was a great meeting-of-the-mind relationship between Abby and Bobby in that after his having been away for so long in the Navy their communciation skills seem to be reduced to the bed. I had to stop reading this book which is rare. For me a novel with two authors rings warning bells. And unfortunately this was no exception. Really hack work that makes one wonder why it got past some editor's slush pile. I'd have given it no stars if I could have done."},{"rating":"2","title":"not just for women","review":"I read sunlight and shadow because my wife and her firends were so enthusiastic about it. I was expecting it to be a woman's book, but after the first few pages I got hooked. Especially after Abby and her husband come to New Mexico and he goes missing. The book is more about the community and how Bobby's disappearance affects everyone more than being a \\"who done it\\"--but the mystery worked for me, too. Kept me guessing until the last page. Great work,ladies, I look forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable reading","review":"This book is a heartwarming story that has an excellent plot and keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is also true to the southwestern culture.

Living in Albuquerque, NM it was exciting to read the names of restaurants, different locations, things that happen here in New Mexico and know exactly where they were and what it was about. As for the book, the authors did a great job capturing the essence of La Familia. The characters are so different and unique in their own way. A suspenseful mystery to the very end. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burnout 5 Is Not Paradise","review":"I wish I would have known the following before I wasted $60 on this.Road Rage is still my favorite except Open World = No Instant Restart = Lame. Constantly checking the map sucks. Crash Mode is gone. And there's no split-screen. With the Burnout series the only thing I want to do is Crash Mode and Road Rage with my wife. Thank you EA for making my wife cry!Now go make Burnout 6 fun again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe how much i didn't like this game","review":"I bought Burnout Paradise because of how much i like Burnout 3 and Burnout Revenge. Everyone i talked to just loved this game. Now when I popped this game in my 360 i was taken away with the nice graphics and the speed and flow of the game was great. But after spending about thirty minutes playing the game i realized it is more frustrating than fun. If you don't care about endlessly crashing and losing than you will have fun with this game. I don't like the open world aspect to the game because it is very difficult to hit your turns when you constantly have to look at a bad map while going at full speed. The desicion to force the gamer to rely on a map really hurts this game. It reminds me of another game called midnight club on the ps2 which had terrible gameplay. This game is very dissapointing and now I have to go back to gamestop and get back my copy of burnout revenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need for Speed in a Burnout style","review":"this game is great. the feeling that we miss in the newly released Need for Speed: ProStreet, is available in this game. all the features included are great, it has all the previous features plus new ones.online multiplayer is fun. you can actually get the achievments while playing online with your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"EA takes a gamble for once.","review":"Innovation is not one of EA's strong suits, and Criterion has basically built the same game over and over. Paradise, on the other hand, does things a little differently, incorporating a big, open world along the lines of a Grand Theft Auto. While the sandbox elements are light, there are a ton of different races to participate in, and once the taste is acquired, it is a good one.However, it won't do anything to convert those who don't care much for racing games--Mario Kart doesn't count!--, and it may alienate those expecting more of the same, which is what EA normally tends to deliver.The on-line play is excellent, smooth, and well-integrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your hats","review":"I need to make a disclaimer--I have really loved the Burnout series. I love racking up points for the best \\"accident\\" and the overall feel of the game. And, this new one did not disappoint. The functionality of the game is high and I like the look of the new game. EA did a great job with this updated version.I've also found that my family continues to enjoy the Burnout series. These games are unlike the GTA games that are filled with hardcore violence, foul language, and sexuality. Instead, Burnout will help you hone your eye hand coordination as you try to hug the tight corners. My hands/fingers get a workout with this game. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best racing game","review":"Burnout Paradise is a step down from its predecessors. It doesn't offer Multiplayer offline and the different game options are all in the campaign. It also makes you buy other features in the game. I just wish I have borrowed it or bought it from a yardsale"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Different From the Previous Games","review":"I received this as a gift. A week or two later I gave it to a friend because I didn't want it, it's nowhere near as fun as previous Burnout titles. So many of the things that made those games fun has been taken away, and this game feels far too repetitive and one-dimensional to offer much else on its own. I was bored with it after an hour or two, I certainly feel bad for anyone who paid $60 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game as expected","review":"This game, like the previous installments, is not perfect but still quite awesome. The Game play is great and easy for anyone to enjoy. The graphics are pretty good, definitely up to par with most games. There are a few things I was disappointed with, such as the lack of crash mode, and the inability to restart events. The minor problems of this game can easily be over looked, as this is one of the best arcade style racing games on the 360."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...HUGE LET DOWN","review":"I've been waiting for this game for over a year now. One of the great things about Burnout Revenge was the fact you could crash into other cars and get a power boost...with Paradise if you hit a car from behind going to fast you will crash...why? The race mode is horrible now, you have to keep your eye on the map the whole time because there are so many different routes to take, playing with somebody else isn't nearly as fun because the takedowns aren't nearly as frequent. What a huge let down compared to Revenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Par Game","review":"The Burnout series has a longstanding tradition of arcade-style carnage, mayhem and destruction without the dark violence of something like, say, Twisted Metal. It feels as though it is tailored to the younger of this generation (in fact I bought it for my 12 year old brother who has had plenty of enjoyment out of it) but, at the same time, it has the capability to appeal to older folks as well. Overall, it's a decent game if you're up for senseless city-wide destruction of property without the violence, blood and guts that pervade the majority of video games today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"I played this myself, and I have 5 and 9 year old sons who also played, and we all enjoyed it. Initially it was a little confusing and I highly recommend the tutorials. Once we got into the game it was quite fun, even for my 5 year old who didn't understand half of it but didn't have too much trouble with the controls. What I really liked was the freedom and open-world aspect of the game. There seem to be no shortage of events and random things to do. The graphics are very good and the game play is addictive. Top grades on this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little different from previous releases","review":"I am a huge fan of racing games, and in particular of the Burnout series. Burnout Paradise is more open ended than previous releases, and also less fun.Why? Where is my crash mode? I loved that single feature of the game most of all. You can make the most realistic driving environment I've played. You can use an awesome physics engine. You can put in great music and a really open ended environment. You can achieve the right blend of difficulty and measured progress. All these elements exist in Burnout Paradise.If you've never played Burnout Revenge you'll never know that Criterion took away a little bit of the fun that made Burnout stand out from the rest of the racers. Crash mode! Bring it back or you'll never rate five stars again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointing","review":"After playing games like Burnout 3, this game seems a little shallow, the open world isn't as fun as it sounds, there aren't too many tipes of game, the showtime is great at first but after a few times it's just boring..the game has great graphics, great controls, but Burnout used to be a good crashing game. Now the crashing seems to be a secondary objective in a game that doesn't have a primary one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh?","review":"What happened to the reviews already left? This game blows, what a waste. Don't go too fast and hit a car or you will crash..."},{"rating":"1","title":"In-game Advertising","review":"I just read an article where EA talks about selling advertising to the Obama campain. There's going to be an ad in the XBox 360 version that reads, \\"Obama for President\\". I think that is going to far. Revenue from sale of the game should be enough for EA, but no, they have to sell ad space so they can make even more money at our expense. No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is NO co-op AT ALL","review":"I have been a fan of Burnout since the original Burnout but this edition is very disappointing. There is no co-op at all, whatsoever. There is NO way you and a friend can grab a controller and play together w/o having two 360's. While the idea of having complete freedom to drive wherever you like may sound appealing, you drive around without a sense of purpose or searching for the kind of race you want. Also you can't hit cars from the rear anymore without getting in an accident which takes out a lot of the fun as well.I believe the Burnout franchise has gone downhill since Burnout 2: Takedown which has won a huge number of awards. Takedown was innovative, fun, and made for a great party game. EA has stripped away way too much of the game in an attempt to create freedom. Go back to Takedown and stick to what has worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A huge improvement from Burnout Revenge","review":"It takes a few tries to get used to the map and the Compass and all but it is so worth the time. This is one of those games that the more i play the more i want to play untill i cant see anymore! Dont be afraid of the change its like an album you have to listen to a few times to get it but then it lasts for a long time instead of getting it right away and getting sick of it a week later. This game is awesome to play online as well. I cant get enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and Fun!","review":"I love this game! It is fast and has lots of action. Love how you have to run down the cars to gain them into your garage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"I got this game used at GameStop. I would get to a certain part of the map and it would freeze on me every time. The game had minor scratches of course. So I ordered one from Amazon. I'm more into Gears of War, Call of Duty, and Halo than anything else. But the first time I played this game it was fun. I love the fact you can make your car bounce and crash into other cars. It's alot of fun with the different types of ways to play this game. The only thing I don't like is you don't get chased by cops. Which would make it more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Game!","review":"I bought this game since I like racing games and though it would be fun, but when i played it, it sucked!

I absolutely hate Burnout Paradise. I loved the games before this one but whoever did this one screwed the pooch. There are no set races you basically just wander aimlessly around a beautifully drawn city with no real goals of any kind. Quite often you'll accidently start a race only to realize too late you did and smash into something and lose.WTF reviewed this game, extremely drunk critics perhaps, that thought driving around and doing absolutely nothing else was the greatest game ever? If you love the Burnout Series just think about how the old games are and then play this game and you may hate is as much as I do. I stupidly bought the game new and paid full price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhh...Why don't You Like This?","review":"It's not the same game... It's better and not as cartoony, it's still alot of fun. the only problems I've had, is no Co-op. It's pretty freaking awesome. The Map thing is a little bit of a pain but I think that'll get better with mor game play.I like it and if you don't then go play something else and quit whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"This game sucks, you have to keep an eye on the map at all times which is unbelievably hard while driving 100+ miles per hour.

I enjoy low budget horror films but to call this a masterpiece is going a bit too far I think. It kept losing my attention on and off throughout whole thing. Comparing it to the films of Dario Argento and Mario Bava is hard to swallow too. It is what it is. A low budget American horror flick that's only good as mindless entertainment.

Good story that also makes you laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but it dragged","review":"Over all, I think the only truly funny moments in the movie was when Norton and Stiller were children. This movie is over two hours long, that is just a little too long for a comedy. It dragged quite a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE IS DISAPPOINTING","review":"Stiller and Norton are DEFINITELY NOT at their best. Stiller does a lot of yelling (as does everyone in the show) and Norton seems to be play acting and normally I think these guys are awesome!The story line is weak and unconvincing. There is way too much kissing/sex scenes and there is absolutely NO chemistry between Stiller and \\"what's her name\\" Really bad. What's her names character is un-believable too. Super high powered flawless business woman. And as if Norton, a priest would go drunk and loud into the synagogue to fight it out with Stiller (who is a Rabi) Stupid.There is one funny moment in this movie and that is when Stiller is out on a date with the aerobics nut and the tug-a-war that ensues afterwards. Hilarious .. But folks -- that is about it.Otherwise it pretty much stinks. 1.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"comedy supposed to be funny","review":"When I hear \\"priest and rabbi \\" I expect to hear the joke next. Not in tnis film. Couple funny moments in the begining and boring melodrama for the rest. Why are these guys priest and rabbi but not carpenter and musician? And such great actors like Ben Stiller and Ed Norton look just stupid and pathetic, but not funny. Maybe because of Norton's directing. Also, heroine Jenna Elfman play is unbelievably bad, reminds me Macaulay Culkin in his worst. So save your time and money. This movie neither funny nor smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Romantic Comedy","review":"Good for Jews, Catholics, and business people alike. This movie is my favorite romantic comedy of 1999. The cast is great Ben Stiller and Ed Norton form the hip young Rabbi/Priest duo who re establish contact with the coolest girl they ever knew growing up who is now this ultra successful business woman. Jenna Elfman (thegirl) is a guys best friend, sweet, exciting and gorgeous. Anne Bancroft is excellent as Stiller's cliched Jewish mother. I love this movie. It's humorous and heart warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny, perky comedy","review":"I find this movie to be very funny and lighthearted.

It is definitely one of the funniest and sexiest scenes I have seen in a long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ed Norton - Stick to dramatic acting","review":"This film is embarassing. I have liked everything Stiller and Norton have done individually but man this film is bad. Promoted as a comedy, there are very few funny moments other than what you see in the trailer. The rest is a confused badly paced romance that never has any tension. The fact that these guys are supposed to be clergy is laughable. There is no chemistry between Stiller and Elfman and Norton's direction is obviously saved by editors."},{"rating":"1","title":"irritatingly idiotic","review":"Huge fan of both Norton and Stiller, enough so that hearing that either of them is playing the lead in any movie is enough to get me to watch it. Nevertheless, this was the worst work I know of either of them doing . . . and they did it together!While the idea of two guys vying for a former childhood playmate is certainly a viable premise for a romantic comedy, I simply wasn't able to swallow the idea of their being a Catholic priest and Jewish rabbi respectively. Not for a second; and since everything that came after depended on your swallowing this, the film was painful to watch.And overlong. Just when you think it's about time to wrap up things, you check the Display on your DVD and see that there are over 60 minutes left!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive To Just ABout Everybody","review":"Once again hollywood has created a film that denigrates Jews and African Americans. The film is full of stereotypes; happy guythat love to sing and rejoice, a big bad nigger that loves to fight. Of course, we don't really know his name because he constantly referred to as \\"T-Bone.\\" Let's see what else, materialistic jews that lack spirituality and the good white christian who is real and feeling.

And when she moves back to NY, they starts seeing her again...Well, the entire movie is boring with some really endless moments of me and my friends wondering were the plot was going.My advice, don't waist your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance","review":"As a romantic comedy it's standard fare. Ben Stiller does his usual array of funny facial expressions, and the female interest is very watchable. My main problem was Stiller's character's supreme ignorance of the arab-israeli dispute. It seemed as though he was trying to trivialise it. Coming from a supposed Rabbi - this was insensitive in the extreme. If this subject had to be brought into a harmless rom-com, then surely it could have been done with maybe a little more tact? Not all of us see suicide bombings and the humiliation of a people as light hearted rom com material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting, Funny....Make You Feel Good","review":"It is hard to believe this is the 1st time these three (Elfman, Norton, and Stiller) have been together in a film. The chemistry was excellent. The storyline about three friends reunited-along with a good soundtrack make for a touching movie. Have a first date tonight? This romantic comedy is the perfect movie to break the ice. The smiles they put on are contagious and you will find yourself and your date smiling and laughing at the same parts. Overall, this is a very clever and entertaining movie. Must be bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Fun","review":"This modern day comedy set against two men and their religious vocations pokes fun at a lot of things while staying up beat.

It had some action, some nudity and a snake-monster all rolled into a fun pseudo sci-fi package.Imagine my disgust and horror upon discovering that the DVD of the film had been edited for content! Don't believe me? Compare it to the video or laser version. The comical sex dream scene at the beginning has been altered so that there are no breasts. There are also no children watching. This may not seem all that important to you, but I think that this silent trimming is quite insidious. The film is rated PG-13 after all, which means that parents should be cautious about showing it to younger kids. Why then must it be cut without telling us so on the package?To sum it up, I love the movie, but I hate this version.

Dennis Quaid was pre-Inner Space, pre-Dragonheart and was sort of on the threshold of being one of the more fun and interesting actors of our time. This was also an overshadowed film by the mega horror spectacle \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" but it's still great fun to enjoy. Very imaginative and different. The dream sequences were phenominal for the time when this film came out. Sort of an Indiana Jones meets Jacobs Ladder.

His riveting turn as Cocaine Traffiker George Jung is one of many reasons to see this movie. The story of how he rises to the top of the drug game starting in the late 60's is told in a very clear, direct and colorful manner with great support from Ray Liotta, Paul Reubens, Franka Potente and Penelope Cruz. While the ending still seems a bit too cloying for me, nearly every frame leading up to the climax is American Cinema at it's best. Of Special Note: the costume design covering 3 decades of fashion, including the outlandish 70's is note perfect and easily adds to the texture and realism of the film without seeming cartoonish or flagrant.

Johnny Depps acting was good, and his portrayal of the character was good, but this movie just seemed to never go anywhere. Never exciting, never thrilling, you feel like youre just watching hours worth of random consecutive events of some man's life. The ending of the movie is heartbreaking, and the message that his father give him becomes cruelly ironic all throughout the film, but i cant give credit to the filmakers for either of those thigns because they were real facts, not anything the directors thought up.

Boy was I wrong. Badly written, badly directed, and completely misguided. Nothing happens in this movie except an unappealing scumbag drug dealer gets arrested over and over. Why should we care? How this man's story ever got told is a mystery to me. It's like Hollywood wanted to make a eulogy to their favorite drug dealer. We even get a loving picture of the real man at the end. Sigh.

Based in the 1970's George Jung (Depp) and Tuna head out to California to find themselves in the thick of a drug infused environment. The two east coast guys find themselves in Derek Foreal's eccentric salon discussing how they want to sell pot. Eventually George Jung becomes the name to buy from at that time and expands. He eventually is selling Coke to all the people of California in the late 70's and becomes the king pin of coke in California. Based on a true story George Jung and Pablo Ecobar go through a lot of rough patches together after meeting in prison.I found this movie to be quite entertaining. The cast is very good and work very well together. This is one of my favorite movies because it is a funny and entertaining movie. The movie itself is has a good plot and has its ups and downs.

I bought it on here a [Amazon.com] long, long time ago. The only thing you have to keep in mind is just because it is actually based on a true story & actual events does NOT mean it is an autobiography. In other words, there are of course going to be both added events & deleted ones as well. So, if you're looking for more of a biography &/or autobiography my advice is to purchase the book. However, this is a good movie & if you can just go into it either not caring that it's not a story told verbatim/word-for-word, or if you can separate the two, (book & movie) then, I really feel almost anyone will very much enjoy this movie.

They all pretty much got what they deserved from beginning to end, and you were actually glad to see the main character losing everything.

He seems to have copped it by watching Good Will Hunting about six times. He should have watched it six or eight more times.But, yeah, that triumverate of acting talent doing a line, that's about the high point. The soundtrack is great, and the audio is well produced.

He is an acting GOD that can tackle any, and i mean any role that you throw at him. He is smart, articulate and humorous. And he is amazingly good-looking. It doesnt get much better than that.

Its one of those movies that has that \\"it\\" that makes you feel good about paying to watch it (and about paying to buy the DVD). The whole story is great and the script is very, very well developed; fast-paced but never loosing its sense of order; the lessons it teaches about life and about destiny will impact you, mostly because of the great acting by Depp and Liotta; and the movies follows itself throughout with good music and greatly created scenes.\\"BLOW\\" is by far one of the best movies in recent memories, and its actors, screenplay, and storyline make it what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well acted, but emotionally empty.","review":"Johnny Depp gives an interesting performance as George Jung in \\"Blow,\\" but I didn't like this film, nor did I understand its points. Was I supposed to care for Jung? His actions brought about the deaths of thousands and ushered in the current state of drugs in America. He lived in decadence by helping others ruin their lives. He lost his money, and he kept making mistakes, getting involved with drug trade when he should've gotten out of it.The film seems, to me, to want you to sympathize with Jung, yet, as a viewer, you cannot. He is not a hero.When he loses his daughter in the end, it's not sad. It's fitting.Ted Demme, who died one year after directing this, created an interesting film, but it's one that seems to make a hero out of a man who doesn't fit the mold."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you love Goodfella or DrugKing type movies.....","review":"then this should be a good watch for you.Depp is soooooo hot and he plays the drug king perfectly.

Anyone familiar with Scorsese's GoodFellas will recognize the similarities and do themselves a favor by watching it again instead of this copycat. Blow is a fair enough film for those who aren't too choosy about what they watch--it seems unfortunate, though, to waste time watching it when you could instead be seeing the highly superior films that it borrows from (GoodFellas, Boogie Nights)."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie ever seen","review":"This is one of the worst movie that I ever seen.

Ray Liotta: not convincing as Jung's father. Penelope Cruz: tiresome. The score: rocks. Editing: moves the story along, truly good. Subject matter: well-worn. Main character narration: been there, done that. Throw all the elements of Blow into a bowl, mix and pour, and you've got a very, very good movie. Not the best -- Goodfellas wins that prize for this type of film -- not the worst, and not even \\"just fair.\\" But good. I sat down to watch it, skeptical at first. But as soon as the opening tune began and the narration kicked in -- done before in other films or not -- I was hooked and pleasantly surprised. So, he's a drug dealer. But he's well-played by Depp and his story is one of regret. Though many reviewers didn't feel for the guy at all, I did. The story is about drugs. Not exactly the Brady Bunch.

Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles was still fun, but less so. The producers explain that they came to Los Angeles because it is so unlike the Australian Outback. The thing I liked the least was the use of Paramount Studios playing itself. While the story made a good reason to be there, it always seems like a way to save money. The story picks up about ten years after the previous left off with Dundee and Sue not yet married, but with a son. The story begins with a Dundee who is losing the knack of catching crocks and Sue has good reason to brings them back to America. It has a happy ending so all ends well. While not up to par with the others, if you liked the first two, you'll still like this, just not as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but pushing it...","review":"I thought the movie was definately worth seeing.

I was not disappointed & felt is wasn't a waste of money as some have stated.Maybe the bad reviews are because it ISN'T full of filthy language, violence, sexual situations & nudity that some think is needed to make a \\"good movie\\". I personally enjoy watching something that all my family can enjoy & laugh to.

In this movie we have the tiresome \\"fish out of water' theme which has been literally \\"done to death\\" over the past 30 years and leaves the viewer with nothing original to watch.Sadly by now Mick Dundee's skin looks about as old and wrinkled as the crocodiles he used to hunt and LA is not the place to be if you are a tired old man. Forget the plot , it's just nonsense about drug smuggling.Gee.Isn't that an original idea about LA ?

I thought it was witty, and warm, and a lot of fun. I thought the 2 leads had amazing chemistry. They have NO chemistry is this movie. NONE. They were barely in any scenes together, which is a shame. It's almost as if they are in two separate movies that intersect every now and then.THe story is so contrived- she has to help her Father out- they come to LA (no- I can't beleive they live in Walkabout Creek full time), she gets enmeshed in a story, Mick yet again saves her by getting to the route of the problem, blah, blah, blah.

The third one arrived 13 years later. I would say it is way too late for a sequel. So it didn't do well at all the box office. But surprisingly the third one is much better than the second one. The story about Mick Dundee visited LA only to discover a Hollywood film company is smuggling expensive paintings from former Yugoslavia. It is quite funny and with quite a few of one liners. George Hamilton and Mike Tyson appear as cameo. The DVD itself is good. Excellent picture transfer and the Dolby 5.1 is OK.

However, as a mystery, which is what it's supposed to be, it stunk. An enormous amount of literary references, you have to be extremely well-read to pick up on them. Lot of talk about food, which is natural, considering the author used to be a chef. I liked the characters immensely, just nothing much ever happened. It was two complete stories, neither one of much interest. No real suspense, or who-done-it, or danger, or anything.

They say it is North-North-East of Edmonton, but it is North-North-West. This movie is so full of holes!! The plane comes to a rest half off a cliff, but no other scene shows the cliff. They drive from B.C. to Niagara Falls for the (quite awesome) bridge scene, in a few hours. A guy falls several hundred feet during an avalanche, while moments before he was in a wooded valley. The snow comes and goes. People arrive out of nowhere. The bear eats two humans in as many days. The movie box also says it is a chemical weapon, but it is a mind controlled weapon, with what seems to be electro-magnetic parts. The only chemical is there to destroy the machine.

The information deals mainly with the story of Our Lady of Guadalup and its impact on Mexican-American women. The author sheds light on the story by giving Aztec background, allusions, and references. My only complaint is that the writer chose only to include Mexican-American women from California in her survey.

Nevertheless, this book was very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"No fun escapism here, just the sharp reality of the guillotine","review":"Short crisp sentences. Easy to read, but in total not necessarily easy to understand if you start thinking about what this story might mean.

What was he thinking? He is a man who thinks for himself. How could he get himself into such trouble? Unlike everyone else (according to the priest) when faced with death Meursault does not submit to the comfort the priest offers, even though he admits he is afraid.More proof that Meursault was an independent thinker can be found on page 42 where he expresses his opinion about Paris: \\"It's dirty. Lots of pigeons and dark courtyards. Everybody's pale.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironically sensational","review":"This book changed my life. Period. Camus, best known for his advocacy of existentialism and absurdism and his collection of essays, writes a novel that seeps into one's subconscious and begins to have the reader identify with the character, care about the character, and wonder about the absurdity of the trials and ridiculous nature of humans.Intriguing, engaging, page-turning and (sadly) short, this book is a great weekend read. This translation in particular makes the story accessible and easy to comprehend-- a major plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read","review":"This is a slim novel, a very fast read. You can't help but be affected by the circumstances in which Monsieur Meursault finds himself in. The novel tackles plenty of issues, including morals, judgment, and even the death penalty.I read Matthew Ward's translation from the French, and he had some interesting notes and tidbits to share.

I think this novel was fast-paced and easy to read, but it was not very exciting. I would not recommend reading The Stranger. I did not find it exhilerating.

While in his trial the man is bored and is eventually sentenced to have his head cut off. While waiting for his execution, he tells the chaplain that he doesn't believe in God and never will. The book ends with him in prison, waiting hopelessly for his execution.I did not particularly like this book. It is boring to read a book when the character has no emotion.

How wrong they were. The plot makes no sense, the characterization is meager & unconvincing, and the only poetic prose occurs on the last page as our hero (ha!) languishes in prison in the final hours before he is to be executed, wondering what it all means & railing at humanity for treating him like the dog he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"tosses out morality and rationality.......","review":"The Stranger is an existential story of a man living his life as a self-determing individual. He feels that nothing is truly wrong or right and therefore nothing that he does makes any difference or has any real impact except to himself. It is almost as if he is on a stage writing his life as he goes, acting it out and the rest of the universe is merely a backdrop for whatever he chooses to pursue. It is a timeless novel that tosses out morality and rationality as a means to make choices. It shows a vast emptiness, a soulessness that is overpowering in its totality. This is an amazing, insightful look at life where no matter what one does, the end will always be the same. It is interesting to note that Camus while having the belief that the universe was a cold and indifferent place, still believed in the dignity of each individual being and had a concern for their welfare. It is one of the most widely read books, but it is bleak in an eye-opening manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely Depressing","review":"While I loved the book and its concepts, it left me feeling rather depressed about the characters.

At the time, it made very little sense to me; I simply did not have the necessary life experience to appreciate it. I think I understood, on some level, that Nothing/Death/Emptiness/the possibility of Fate was the basic gist of it all, but now I see a whole lot more here.Now I think that Albert Camus' THE STRANGER is a book more about anonymity, destiny and the absurdity of human life. (Scary)Now I do understand. (I think.) I fancy myself an Existentialist, but this is difficult reading despite the straight-forward langage, plot and character-development.I do recommend this book, but probably to people in atleast their late teens--someone who is not afraid to think about the nothingness that may lie beyond death.I will not be reading this book again. It reminds me too much THE UNDERGROUND MAN (DISTURBING AND ALL ALONE!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book that you can get a lot of meaning out of.","review":"Albert Camus describes in great detail what this man is thinking through the book.

The last 5 or so pages are stunning, and with reflection upon the rest of the novel, I was smacked in the face with a picture of modern man so clear and untainted that I could almost see Camus chipping away at years of Plato's absolute morality... It's not the most entertaining novel one could read, but it is truly a classic of absurdist existential philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just think about it!","review":"Throughout my A1 language course, I have to read several books including world literature. The Stranger was one of them and when I finished reading the book I wondered what the propose or theme of this book was. A rational man telling a story in a very monotone way who seems to reject emotions and doesn't mind about anything? Is that what the whole book is about? Yes it is! Camus is trying to illustrate a character who doesn't intend to harm our society and in return is disowned and hated. The fact that Mersault always sticks to the truth is seen as something repulsive which make him different and simultaneously he is put into the category stranger. It is useless to search for the theme of the book for there are many. The novel includes so many interesting aspects which can be interpreted in so many different ways that almost any description of the book will suit the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"English wouldn't do it JUSTICE.","review":"Albert Camus has been the man behind the amazing popularity of this book. Because of the disillusionment during the war, the characterization of Mersault is one of no emotions or sentiments. While studying French, we had the chance to read and explore the language and its syntax, as well as the story and the theme of the \\"absurde\\". Personally, the English version of this book does no justice to Albert Camus's impeccable style of description, or lack thereof. The precision of French is lost in the translation to muddled English words. The story comes off as one of plain repitition with no purpose, and the story becomes, at once, dull and unimaginative.Frankly, I hated it. Every single bit of it. And I recommend that anyone with the knowledge of the French language ought to try it in French rather than English."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stranger","review":"Traditionally this is considered a book about alienation. To me it tells the tragedy of having feelings considered alien by the society in which you live.After killing a man, Meursault is taken before people who shamelessly express their desire to judge him by his personality rather than by what he did or didn't. Even the fact that he was not seen to cry at his mother's funeral becomes an evidence of his guilt. At the same time when all society turns against him in repulsion for his diversity, we start to see the honesty and naivety inherent in his thoughts and decisions. His realization at the end is genial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it really matter?","review":"In the opening chapter we learn that Meursault's (the main characters) mother passed away, yet Meursault stands devoid of any emotional attachment (he didn't even cry). Intrigued by his apathy, I felt Meursault displayed traits of a psychopath. After much searching, I finally realized why Meursault felt indifferent towards his mother. Meursault is a existentialist by nature. Once that is realized, the book travels a linear path to the finale. Meursault life is much too empty, and his existentialist philosophy affects no change in his life. Meursault's friends are more chaotically inspired, than mutually beneficial. In a nutshell Meursault could careless where his relationships lead him. The beauty of the story is found at the end. He convincingly argues about the meaning of fate and life. To him nothing really matters outside the freedom of nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing but cold-hearted","review":"I didn't expect Camus to be optimistic, of course, but The Stranger absolutely haunted me. Meursault's plight is all of ours. His crime, basically the crime of indifference, is something of which no one can, really, be acquitted. I am sort of a withdrawn person, and Meursault actually appealed to me as a character, although his actions repulsed me. Overall, this book was very frightening in a good way (especially the end of it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Better Translation","review":"The Matthew Ward translation is inferior to the translation by Stuart Gilbert. Using the French \\"Maman\\" does nothing for the reader of English and, in fact, detracts from the quality of the reading experience. Compare the last several lines of the two translations, and you will find Gilbert's much more powerful, even lyrical. When I first read Camus' book, which is my favorite novel, only the Gilbert translation was available, and it blew me away. When the new improved version came out, I read it and tossed it in the trash. Gilbert, however, makes Camus' lines sing with electricity. If you can get the older translation, do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Undesputed Classic","review":"I read the Stranger (actually i read the translation entitled The Outsider, but it's the same thing) in my grade 11 world literature class. The book revolves around the main character named Meursault. The novel, deep rooted in its existentialist theme, is one of the most mentally stimulating books you will ever read. Albert Camus suggests that the pinnacle of hypocrisy in society is its quickness to judge people upon appearances or behavior, versus its apparent incapacity to judge people upon fact. I will refrain from making any conjectures about the novel, its theme and message, because that is something you must do for yourself. After reading the novel, dont rush to the internet to read essays and reviews about the novel. Instead spend some time contemplating the book yourself. Then open yourself to the opinions of others. It is one of those books that you will never forget, and will change the way you see things, at least temporarly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting insight into the prevailance of injustice","review":"At first this was just one of those books assigned to read during tenth grade English. The sheer immediacy of the tale changed that. This book is philosophical to the hilt, questioning the general concept of reality itself.

A true revolutionary novel and one of the best written, ever, hands down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story Line!!","review":"This Book was very interesting and kept my apt attention.

My entire life was changed. The previous translator did Camus justice. Matthew Ward, with this translation of The Stranger, ruined the novel. Ward includes awful cliche and unintelligent description.

Good for him. I am still angry that I had to read this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad","review":"The book The Stranger I thought was the worst book I have ever read. The whole book was pointless. The end was very dumb, after the whole book he ends up have feeling and being happy but thinks oh well its to late Im going to be killed. The end killed me it was very bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stranger","review":"Personally, I didn't think this book was very good. The whole concept of writing a book about a faceless man just doesn't appeal to me. I know that all of Camus books are strange but this one just wasn't one of his better books. The book just didn't have enough going on in it. The entire book was about the faceless man killing someone and then getting executed. I think the book probably would hae been more interesting if maybe the man fell in love before the execution. It also would have been better if at the end of the book, he actually wrote about the execution instead of just letting us hang, not knowing about what happens at his executon. The exection probably would have made the book alot more exciting too. So if I were you I probably wouldn't read the book unless you are into really wierd, boring books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sartre eat your heart out!","review":"No one was more responsible for the nurturing and development of the existentialist philosophies than Jean Paul Sartre. That said, Sartre's words simply lacked the power and more importantly the compassion and understanding of Albert Camus. Camus starts his text, The Stranger, with the literary equivalence of a powerful punch. He ends it with two punches. Despite my disagreement over key elements in his philosophies, I am nonetheless more than impressed with his concise voice and storytelling. The Stranger is not only a must read, but a mantra to many bearing the angst of irrelevance. I highly recommend \\"The Myth of Sisyphus\\" for further insight into this wonderful text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stranger means a hell of a lot.","review":"The basic problem of The Stranger isalienation. Meursalt kills a man, butdoesn't feel sorry for killing him.Why not? Is it because his mother dieda few days earlier? Is it because ofhis refusal to believe in God? May itjust be that his life is utterly meaningless?Those who read the afterword in the Penguinedition of The Stranger (The Outsider)must consider the author's explanation -'So one wouldn't be far wrong in seeingthe The Outsider as the story of a man who,without any heroic pretentions, agrees todie for the truth.' 'The Stranger doesn'tmean anything' is a lie. Why? Meursaltdoesn't think so. Secondly, Albert Camusdoesn't think so. And thirdly, thereviewer doesn't think so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn...my face is falling off...","review":"This book was nuts.

As. I have stated in my summary, there is better existentialism to be found. If I wished to be rude, I would say that Albert Camus is just a Dostoyevskiy/Kafka 'wannabe'. I do not so wish it, so I will merely state that this book does not suffice to place him in the same catagory as those masters. If you really enjoyed Stranger, then *Crime and Punishment* will blow you out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will make you think","review":"This is the first book I read by Camus and it inspired me to read more. If you like books with lots of plot and little introspection this is not for you, but it is the short plot that makes it more interesting I think. Mersault lives in an algerian town in the 1940s and this book describes his life and a crucial event in it. The point of the book was to show us how our actions and thoughts are dominated by society's expectations. In it Mersault is presented both as a conscious human being whose actions we (as him) understand but also as the monstrous figure he presents himself as to society, re: attitudes to his response to the death of his mother, the way in which he treats Marie. I was struck by this book because not only could I see myself in Mersault re his sensualism, and selfcentredness, but also by the way in which I as part of society condemn the actions of others.It is a simple book to read, but one which will make you think, so I recommend you try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterful","review":"existentialism brokered to fit a minimalistic nature within a man, a detailed foray of the solidarity that each person invariably edges towards."},{"rating":"2","title":"shubham basu","review":"The thoughts captured in this narration are eternal, they are not bound by space and time. The mind, when captured by the simple description of Camus, without delving into psychology and philosophy, gives a reader an adequate opportunity to build an opinion for himself. In short, this book is a spoon full of potion, which carries one to that corner of human mind, which perhaps one would never be able to experience even in imaginations, in his lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves A Second Read...Deep","review":"I have often heard that in a translation, part of the story is lost. I could not help feeling this as I was reading this book. Although I feel as though I have missed a few things in Camus' message, the novel offers interesting (and sometimes bizarre) insights on certain subjects such as death, love, and religion. The grotesqueries in the book are often behind great thought, and because I read this in a day, a deeper analysis of the book might help in understanding some of Camus' intents. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a quick (but long lasting in thought) reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book since I was 16.......","review":"This book has earned a bad reputation based on the plot along with the Cure's song, \\"Killing an Arab\\".

It's a classic. The end."},{"rating":"2","title":"More like 4.6 stars","review":"Goddammit, I LIKE this translation! I wish people would stop putting it down. Although it has none of the poetic beauty of the other main translation, that is the WHOLE POINT! Read it in the French or have someone translate it for you (for the French- impaired, like me) and you will realize that part of the book's power is the stark, straight-to-the-point style of writing. Camus is a genius, and this translation is truest to his original words. Prepare to be shocked, entertained, amused...and ultimately to see yourself in this book. (Or worse, NOT to see yourself...) This is most definitely worth your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'll keep this short. The book was an awful read save the last ten pages.

The critics say it is a brilliant insight on the personality of the absurd, and they believe that Camus is amazing. Please. Camus could not decide what kind of character he wanted Meusault to be. One minute M. didn't care about anything, while the next he was absorbed in Marie's smile. I did not find the book insightful at all, and I honestly feel it is a waste of time to try to find deep meaning in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Existentalistic Trash! Ugh,worst book EVER.","review":"Camus'little novel about a nihilistic nobody who sheds no tears over the death of his haggy old mother, does boring things and commits a murder. That's the plot. Gee, I hated this book. Hated it. The main character's behaviour and atheistic beliefs slightly offended me. Don't waste your time on this. Read Ionesco's 'Four Plays' instead. Then again, I might be wrong. After all, a critic's review is based solely upon his or hers personal opinion. It could be a wonderful novel, but not bloody likely.

No wonder students drop out of college and feel they are wasting their money. America is producing some fabulous literature yet there is an old guard that clings to all that is bleak in life. May I recommend Victor Frankle’s Man’s Search for Meaning? This is a much better and true account of the human spirit and what it can accomplish.

Walter Kaufmann has noted the general vacuity of Camus' thought in his (Kaufmann's) prolific criticism on existentialism. Philip Freund, in his meticulously long essay \\"Albert Camus and Symbolism\\" (in The Art of Reading the Novel) has convincingly demonstrated the alarmingly weak structural integrity of much of Camus' fictional work.

His views on women and relationships are no less than vile. He does not even remorse over the death of his mother. He then says that he no emotional attachment to Marie, the lady that he is sexually active with. Thankfully, he commits a cold blooded murder and is put to death. And at his execution, he says that he wishes there be \\"howls of execration.\\" It is amazing to me that an individual can want there to be people cursing him on the day of his death.

I found after a few pages that I didn't really care what happened to the main character any more than he seemed to care what happened to himself.

Since it's only about 123 pages long, it is definitely a quick read. The storyline goes at a good pace and there's just enough happening to keep you interested in the plot.Most people I've talked to about this book didn't care for the lack of details. That didn't bother me so much. The only reason that I am not giving this book a better review is because of my frustration with the main character. If Mersault would just CARE about something, anything, the outcome of this story would be so much different. Sure, this is the point the author is trying to get across, but still. I found Mersault's stand-offish attitude to be very frustrating.This is definitely one of those books that you want to discuss with a friend when you are finished, so be sure that if you grab this book, grab another copy for a friend as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stranger: A thought provoking yet depressive novel","review":"The Stranger (or the Outsider depending on translation) is a novel that will make you question your life, how you live it and the reason for it. Although written in the 1940's its content is still totally relevant today and allows the reader a bitter- sweet read through Camus' use of simple yet decadent language.The main protagonist Meursault lives his life by the sun, but circumstances push him closer to the death that he has spent all of his life living for. The novel is entirely ambiguous but this is what makes it such a fascinating read as each reader interprets the text differently to satisfy their own personal self. Camus leaves us questioning all aspects of life including mortality, nature, religion, society, love and hate with all of these themes combining to make The Stranger a thought provoking yet depressive novel that must be read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is absurd","review":"Reading this not too long yet so deep novel, I cannot help but visualize Camus' picture of which he is smoking a cigar with such pensive expression on his face.It may seem, to some people, that Meursault was an absurdly hopeless man who apparently had no emotion whatsoever. But as his attitude, if any, toward life shows it is all a matter of choice. Whichever may have its own value.Just like what existentialism sees in life.The beauty of ascetic life echoes A.Camus words:In the depth of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read it if it's assigned schoolwork","review":"I didn't know it at the time this was assigned to me, but I was bound to hate this book. Correctly called an existentialist masterpiece, the book runs in circles. You cannot identify with this character because he is so detached from his existence. The only 'moral lesson' to be had seems to say that existence has no objective meaning, only that which you give it (an existentialist tenet) and if you give it no meaning, it doesn't matter any way (point of the book).As an Objectivist, I just can't identify with or support that in any way. The book gets 2 stars because Camus' use of language is wonderful, but it is a talent wasted on a pointless book. If you want to read a book with purpose instead, pick up Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged. Although her use of language is not as fluid, the themes of her books make much more sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"often-boring book about heartless people","review":"The characters in this book make my skin crawl. Salamano beats his dog, Raymond beats his mistress, Meursault kills a man for no reason, and then a bunch of stupid court officials try Meursault for his character instead of his crime. Meaursault himself seems psychopathic. As someone who has been diagnosed with moderate recurrent depression, I have felt miserable for long periods of time, tried to disengage from life, and believed that existence has no meaning. A lot of people have had these thoughts, because life is cruel and unfair. And yet, unlike Meaursault, we haven't killed anyone.Maybe if it were the first existensialism I'd ever read, I would have been impressed. As it is, I just think The Stranger is a bleak book about a bunch of terrible people."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Got an A+ On My Paper - But I Hated It","review":"I read this book in High School and I hated it. Even to my young 17 year old brain, the concepts of philosophy seemed ludicrous. I guess I must have understood them on some basic level, because like I said, I got an A.

This is translated into \\"American.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting...","review":"The book is very short and very simplistic; I felt that not Camus, but the one who translated it did not do a good job. It is a bit confusing because Meursault starts out as not caring about anything, but then he seems so infatuated with Marie. So it was a bit hard to decide what kind of character Meursault was supposed to be, although it does in a way show us that humans are not logical beings. On the intellectual level this book was not very appealing at all; most of Meursault's experiences were generalized. I have to say that the book only gets interesting in the last 20-30 pages, that is where the action starts to happen. Everything else before that is vague and garbage, it only talks about this guy who does not have feelings, but wait he does have feelings, or maybe he doesn't. If I were you, I would save the time and read another more interesting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without Caring We Are Nothing","review":"I love this book!Well-developed characters and an underlying unanswered question take you on a ride you won't soon forget.I really appreciated the visual imagery as well.

You can read it just as a simple story about a man that kills another in a stupid way. There are great chances of you to enjoy it. But you can also read it as a story of a man in an absurd world...the same world we live in. I recommend for anyone who reads this book to re-read it. And again. And again. The more you read it, the stronger it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusingly simplistic","review":"This is another selection assigned to high school students which seems to be a part of the common theme of examining the inner self and its struggle between good and evil. The Stranger has a Stephen King flavor to it when it comes to the main character, Meursalt. Meursalt has no feelings for anything or anyone. At his mother's funeral, he is a blank slate. His nonchalant response is to everything is basically 'I guess'. Then he is put on trial for murder. This lack if feeling for anything continues, even as he heads to the guillotine. I am confused why this is such an important read, but it is still assigned. Camus' style is overly simplistic and repetitive to the point of annoyance. It is not the worst book I have ever read, but I question its value even to high school students who probably won't catch whatever Camus is attempting to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short story, profound thoughts","review":"For the first half of the book, I was kind of wondering how this was an existentialist masterpiece. It wasn't bad, it wasn't completely pointless, but it lacked depth. I was too quick to try to clue this book out, I suppose. Eventually, it all tied together and I could see how profound it was.I think this is a book that warrants multiple readings and quite a deal of analysis afterwards. I don't want to go into my own analysis too much partly because I don't think I've completely figured out what I think about it. Do I sympathise with Meursault? Or am I getting sucked into his perspective, his bias in the narrative?In any case, it should stick in your mind for quite a while after reading it, as your brain picks it apart, and I think this makes it well worth reading. It is surprisingly easy to get through anyway. I would, however, like to dust off my French to read the original as I do wonder if the language has been simplified or dulled a little in translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The start for me ...","review":"I was a putz throughout my early school years until an English teacher in high school assigned this book. I've read it 2 dozen times since and each time I pick up a little bit more. The opening classic line is a wonderful prelude to existentialism. It also turned my head around enough to take something other than football, drumming and weightlifting serious. It made me want to read and ultimately write. Everybody should read this baby at least a couple times (with a good deal of distance between the reads for full appreciation). Camus turned me on to Sartre (No Exit) and that made me want to write plays ... which lead to waking up from the deep sleep I was in the first 20+ or so years of my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Old Magic Instead","review":"I had read the book Old Magic which is by the same author and I loved it.

I highly reccomend these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story skimmed off the top","review":"I was so disappointed after reading this trilogy. The idea of the story itself was what attracted me in the first place. I found the alternating points of view extremely annoying. Because the focus changes from one character to another so quickly, I felt I was only skimming the top of the story. I was also disappointed at how the story ended. She just left the characters hanging at the end of the battle. What happend to their future? I don't recommend this trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for young adults too","review":"I bought this book because of all the other great reviews and I was not disappointed.

Homer's uncle Hercules quickly sets the tone of disbelief by spinning some yarns that have just enough \\"truth\\" to them to be plausible. This is a truly a story of the American Scene in a time when people entertained themselves by gabbing with one another and singing songs together instead of hiding in the basement watching videos. Good old timey values like hucksterism, lying, and cheating face the good natured community of Centerburg and sometimes turn it upside down. Strange things happen in Centerburg, and the curious Homer Price is going to get to the bottom of it. Robert McClosky is also one of our finest illustrators and his lively drawings add texture and background to the story. Highly Recommeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a lot of fun","review":"The adventures of Homer, Freddie and their friends are a lot of fun to read.

This dictionary includes many dialectical words like\\"mud clerk\\" that are not included in other unabridged dictionaries.This book is helpful with pronunciation (there are usually several variants included)and etymology (for those who need it)Still, I would highly recommand Random House Webster's Unabridged instead, for those who need detailed and absolutely perfect usage notes and regional varations.

It's pace is written like a golden age sci-fi novel in its \\"fast-paced one-problem/one-solution\\" approach. It was unflavored and the plot was jerky most of the time.

Nicole's performance was one of the best of the year, tightly controlled, never begging for audience sympathy and a sharp critique of the quest for stardom and notoriety. For some inexplicable reason, even after winning the Golden Globe, she didn't even get an Oscar nomination. Shame! In this film she mixes together, most deliciously, the collective \\"wit\\" and \\"intelligence\\" of such \\"newsbabes\\" as Ms Shriver, Ms Walters and Ms Sawyer who still report all news as though the loss of a button is equal to the loss of a life. After watching this film I started referring to Tom as Mr. Kidman. Ileana Douglas is also in the film and is the perfect antidote for Kidman's character. A beautiful film in the vein of American Beauty with it's unblinking eye focused on American life and the American experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're not getting it","review":"I just love this movie, and I think the reviewer doesnt understand it ! First, it's nothing but a comedy, even though you laugh quite a lot. But this also shows that, whatever happens, it's not the adult, pretty and intelligent one who pays.

So she cons three half-wit teenagers into an overly-complicated plot to kill off her husband, then refuses to pay them off or continue her relationship with two of them that had motivated their participation in the first place.Ergo, the plot is dumb, the acting isn't much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strange And Fascinating Story","review":"This is a different story and definitely interesting. The movie is listed as a comedy but it's more of a drama. Yes, the comedy is there but it's dark humor and there is violence and tragedy here. It's fascinating, every time I watch it.Nicole Kidman is very good as the beautiful and ruthless blonde who has big television ambitions. I don't know if I ever saw Kidman look this pretty, which is saying a lot. Matt Dillon co-stars and is excellent, too, as are the two young no-name actors, Joaquin Phoenix and Allison Foland. Ironically, Phoenix went on to become a big star. When this movie came out, few people knew him.Illena Douglas gives an underrated performance and I always enjoy the odd Dan Hedaya. Anyway, if you want to see something definitely different in the way of a story, this movie falls in that category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark comedy from decade ago","review":"Ten years ago, I enjoyed To Die For as a brilliant dark comedy that most of the rest of the world just didn't seem to \\"get.\\" Watching it a decade later on DVD, some of the thrill is lost. It's still a decent black comedy with Nicole Kidman as an absolutely wicked manipulator of a woman, but the laughs I remember just aren't there.I do enjoy the storytelling style. We all know what is going to happen (Kidman is going to hire her teenage lovers to kill he husband), so the director has a challenge of keeping the audience's interest until that point. This is accomplished by unfolding Kidman's career and rise to the top through a series of first-person narratives by the different characters in the story. It's almost as if the family members and friends are being interviewed by a TV news camera after the climax of the story, and the technique is very well done.If you like offbeat, dark cinema, give this one a shot, but don't expect award-winning drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fame","review":"I think this is one of Nicole Kidman's best roles. I also loved her in The Others and The Hours. Her character in To Die For is diabolical and shady and you feel like bashing her face in at times because she is just so selfish and phony. Unfortunately she messed with Italians and look what ended up happening to her. Don't f@#$% with the mob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance from Nicole Kidman.","review":"Everything about this movie is perefect, but it is ultimately Nicole Kidman's performance that stands out. Her outer physical beauty does not alter the fact that deep inside, her character is a ruthless, evil, cold blooded killer. It just goes to show that you can't judge a person by their physical appearance. The movie also does a great job of showing the three teenage characters as being basically losers who seem to be destined to be stuck in their small town for the rest of their lives.

The Social Contract was published in 1970 and is one of the most thought-provoking and influential books that I have read. Among other things, Ardrey accurately predicts and explains our defeat in Viet Nam, and explains why housing projects are failures.

The movie is extremely slow with the first five minutes showing two people on horseback. There doesn't seem to be anything pulling the movie together to make you want to watch the ending.

This was bad, not worth buying, just renting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said the A&E 2001 version of this story is much better. While the actors in this version are better known, there was no chemistry at all between Clive Owen and the female lead. Also, the way the \\"romance\\" was handled created no dramatic tension. In fact, the pacing seemed off for the entire movie. What should have been adventurous and daring ended up flat, boring, and slightly confusing. I don't think it was the brevity of the film itself--I found myself waiting for it to end--but rather that the elements that make up good story telling were markedly absent. I was glad I had gotten this out of the library and neither rented nor bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull but entertaining","review":"When I first went to rent this movie, I was expecting a wonderfully portayed old-english love story with one of my favorite actors, Sean Bean. However, after watching it, I feel it falls short of a romance movie and instead makes its way toward a low-budget comedy movie. This movie was entertaining in that it had comical value in one of the main characters, John Ridd and it had some rather funny action scenes. It lost its potential as a romance when the production crew spent all its money on mediocre actors and gave little attention to sound effects and the screenplay itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sand in the Wind","review":"See my last review for the 'Gear' books.

This is a sad story about a man that we know only as Jim. Jim committed an act of cowardice when he was a mate on a ship. He was only nineteen years of age, and he made a decision to abandon what he thought was a sinking ship and he leaves about 800 passengers to face their fate alone. He can never forgive himself for this, and he personally exiles himself from his own family back in England. This may sound a bit melodramatic, but the book is not. It is beautifully written, rich, evocative and compelling. We see the type of man that Jim becomes as he's trying to get over this big mistake. He appears to be a strong and decisive man but we the readers get glimpses of the chinks in his armour. Until his final ignominious fall - What a waste of a man's life, and what a great story!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord Jim","review":"LORD JIM - I couldn't get into it - rather boring and difficult to follow.Perhaps I will give it another try at another time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Conrad, so I was very disappointed when I read (or slogged through) LORD JIM. Conrad was heavily under the influence of Henry James when he wrote this book, and if you like Henry James, then you'll probably like this one. But, as Michael Crichton said about Henry James, \\"I can't stand Henry James. His stuff reads like a first draft.\\" Conrad writes like Henry James here in that the sentences are eternal and convoluted, and take forever to make a point. And every little thing in LORD JIM is symbolic of...you name it: man's despair, etc. As I said, I love Conrad: HEART OF DARKNESS, NOSTROMO, his short stories. But I found LORD JIM a totally unwelcome change in his writing style, and it was pure tedium for me to make it to the last page"},{"rating":"1","title":"great plot, extremely confusing","review":"Lord Jim had all the key elements for an extremely interesting story, love/ murder/ adventure, but quickly loses the reader with the confusing writing style. It is hard to know who is talking and Jim's personality or looks are only discussed in the first two senetences of the story. I believe that if Conrad had lightened his style a little bit it could have been a much better novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites books","review":"This book is what books were made for. Conrad's gift to build a scene that comes alive in the mind is unsurpassed as far as I am concerned. His characters are imperfect and all too human. Their inner struggles are the same as those we have today. For the novice, this book may seem a little tedious but once you get into the flow of his imagery you are in for a treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moodily romantic","review":"I did not expect to enjoy this book, and it took a little while to get into it, but I found myself enthralled--and by the conclusion, moved--almost against my will.Conrad's style here is a bit moody for my personal taste, but beautiful nonetheless. He makes brilliant use of the English language and is a master of the judicious metaphor. He draws you in as he slowly unravels his tale of an \\"overly romantic\\" man and his \\"exquisite egoism.\\"While Conrad doesn't quite compare with the great romanticists like Hugo and Dostoevsky, Lord Jim is one of the last great romantic novels, certainly far superior to almost any fiction being written today."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Conrad's Finest","review":"Lord Jim is the story of a young ship's officer who makes an inexplicable mistake. Branded a coward and stripped of his license as a sailor, Jim is unable to bear the stigma attached to his life for a brief moment of cowardice. Jim seeks redemption on a small Malay island, only to fail for what one of the characters calls, \\"...a shred of meaningless honor...\\". A truly great work of fiction, Lord Jim is linguistically an easier read than other of Conrad's sea works, but is just as deep. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Wordy!","review":"I was assigned this book through my 10th grade English course. Never before have I been forced to struggle through a book like this one. Conrad's style is adds superfluous information that does absolutely nothing to advance the plot or symbolic significance of the story. The sentences and paragraphs were too large to be dealt with rationally. One of the chapters, which is about 4 and a half pages, is one single paragraph! While the story itself was a good one, Joseph Conrad ruins it with his esoteric and over-descriptive style of novel-writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Dull","review":"It amazes me that an author who is considered so wonderful could be so dull. The book is dry and so hard to get through. I read this for a research paper on imperialism and hated it. Never before did I need to use Cliff Notes. I had to have them so I could understand the chapters as I went along. Only read any of Conrad's work if you really enjoy long, dull, winding, and pointless stories. There are so many descriptions of the setting, that Conrad necer can find the space to focus on the characters. Like Jim, the main character. I know less about him than I do about a stanger that I could meet on the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Many years ago I saw the movie 'Lord Jim' with Peter O'Toole and I thought it was a great flick with a lot of depth and very thought-provoking. It is one of my favorite films. So, I thought I would read the book since I've often found books to be even better than the movie. But, in this case I was sorely disappointed. The book, to me, was very hard to read with exceedingly long sentences and paragraphs and written almost in a 'stream-of-conciousness' mode as told by a third person. I found this to be true of Conrad's 'Nostromo' as well and have to admit that I failed to finish either book because of the cumbersome writing style. Perhaps, I am not smart enough to understand the writing style. In any case, may advice is to watch the movie which I found to be much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you read this thing?","review":"I am a Sophomore being forced to read this difficult and virtually impossible book for class.

OK, I'm in the minority. Most of the reviewers LOVED the book. I think this book is a waste of beautiful words! Yes, Conrad had a beautiful English vocabulary. But, the \\"story\\" is \\"encrusted\\" with so many words you'll tire of it after awhile. OK, try the book, but now, at least, you won't feel as I did, \\"What's wrong with ME that I don't like this book.\\" You won't feel \\"alone\\" in your reaction.

Jargon is defined as speech or writing full of long,unfamiliar, or roundabout words or phrases. Jargon accurately describes this novel.

He shouldn't have tried to write a full-blown novel. Some things should just be kept concise. If you want to read something good from Conrad, go after Heart of Darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master","review":"Reading Joseph Conrad is a true pleasure. His mastery of the language is unparalleled and his sentence structures, although at times dense, as often approach pure poetry. This is even more astounding given the fact that English is a second language for him. This is the story of an untested young English sailor, Jim, who has visualized himself as a man honor and bravery. When he fails miserably at the very first test of his courage, it alters all aspects of his life and his views of himself. Conrad takes us through an intricate retelling of his tale, from the point of his failure forward, through a third party, Marlow - an older sailor who befriends him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without a doubt one of the all time great R & B Live Albums.","review":"The O'Jays capture what soul is all about.

If you're in the market for a sandwich maker AND you like Hello Kitty, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy the wonder of unadulterated genius at work.","review":"I believe this is the greatest book by one of the best authors of all time. To open a St. Exupery book is to think of the spring sun on a cold, cloudy January day. Where does one go from here? To St. Exupery's soliloquy on finding a meteor in the sands of the Sahara? To his tale of surviving the rigors of the desert? To his description of night over the South Atlantic?It is a question that cannot be answered. One should not even try, but should only linger rhapsodized over each description of even the most mundane things by this irresistable wordsmith. Some people never wrote badly, even once. He was one of them and the world is much poorer for his early departure. At least he left this peerless work about early mail pilots.

Pretty ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful content and style, a delightful find","review":"I loved The Little Prince, and thought that I would give Wind, Sand and Stars a try. Lucky for me that I did! A different kind of book than the children's-tale quality of The Little Prince, Wind, Sand and Stars is nevertheless magical in its own way. St-Exupery's ability to blend philosophy with his fairy-tale renditions of the life of a pilot are inspiring to more than one kind of person who seeks to reach the stars. Well worth reading, this book is a delight for anyone who seeks beauty in the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful series of tales/essays by a man who chose to live a life less ordinary","review":"As an office worker I often find myself escaping to books of adventure and travel. Amongst such books the works of Antoine de Saint-Exupery are amongst the finest. Saint-Exupery was a pilot in the fledgling airline industry in the 1920's and 1930's flying mail routes in exotic locales such as Spain, France's African Colonies and South America and then an officer in the French and Free French Air Force during World War Two. But equally importantly Saint-Exupery was an amazing storyteller and philosopher who between tales of plane crashes and amazing escapes reflects on questions such as why do men put their life at risk, when can we say that we truly experience what it means to be alive and what is mans relationship with technology and progress.If you are interested in the 1920's, aviation or simple want to read the thoughts of a man who led an extraordinary life, you will enjoy Wind, Sand and Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievably fantastic; eye opening; gets to, and expands our understanding of our common humanism.","review":"Antoine clearly expresses the true and connecting value of our humanity, uncovers for us what is just below the surface, and UNITES US all with clear examples of self truths that we have missed all along the way. This is one of the most powerful and interesting books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Antoine is a thoughtful romantic.","review":"As a fan of history and a lover of aviation, I very much enjoyed the reflective word that has stood the test of time. I would consider this a staple read up there with Ernest Gaan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wind, Sand & Stars","review":"I can't believe this book is rated so highly! I though it was awful and found the writing very boring. I would read several pages and completely forget what I just read. There were a few good parts, but every time the author would start to draw you in so you feel involved with a character he would stop and completely change subjects. Don't bother with this book. I would highly recommend \\"West With The Night\\" instead if you're interested in pilot stories of this era."},{"rating":"1","title":"For adolescent romantics","review":"Perhaps the translation was bad? After all, the book won a big prize in France. But for me the prose was pedestrian when not purple. The tone was basically puffery for being a pilot. This is the sort of book that would likely excite a schoolboy or girl who is full of romance for adventure. But not for the mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Very Boring","review":"I thought the book was horrible cuz it was nothing that i thought was exciting and also cuz it was very hard to read i hated it but that is my opinion but everyone i asked said they thought the same thing i just said!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romantic Adventurer","review":"This is a beautifully written book exuding a sense of mystery and adventure perhaps no longer possible to experience. Antoine de Saint-Exupery was an aristocrat and pilot who chose to fly lonely postal routes -- a romantic adventurer with incredible sensitivities who was filled with wonder and musings about what he encountered. No one should pass this by. It could be read to a child though it is not a children's story. A popular children's story also written by Saint-Exupery, The Little Prince, was published five years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious for me!","review":"I'm majoring in child and family development and stumbled across this movie at 2 in the morning. I had never heard of the movie, but laughed myself silly. I could write an 8 page paper over the dysfunctions and strengths of this family! This cast consists of many well known individuals. My favorite part had to have been when the Rev. coped with the after effects of his dinner from the previous evening while performing the funeral.

I really wish that they had put more money into this film though. The cinematography seems a little low-budget, some close-up scenes are blurred. Nevertheless, the story line still shines true.

This reluctance stems from the very same attitude expressed by the wannabe's and commentators who try to pick apart the grammar and lack of cohesion in plot development, in a book that has no plot, because it is not fiction.I found The Loving Dominant to be an extraordinary book in explaining the facts of life in a new kind of society to newcomers to the BDSM Lifestyle, and while Mr. Warren's writing style could use some professional polish, it is easily apparent that what he writes is from the heart, coupled with years of experience in helping newcomers. ... Mr. Warren and his book are a Class Act in the truest noble sense of the word Class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible and informative","review":"Warren presents this book as largely a primer on BDSM.

The character design engine is half-baked -- barely a fraction of what you can do with your golfer the Tiger Woods game.Overall, I'm having a hard time thinking of ways to recommend it.

The only good thing I can say about reading this book is that I got it at the library and did not pay for it....I'd have kicked myself if I had paid for it. My advice? Don't waste your time OR your money. How this ever made the Best Sellers List is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The good news is the book was so short, I could finish it and be done with it. This book was about 5 people with absolutely no personality flaws, except the self-absorbed narrator, which, low and behold is a writer! (Note to future novelists - you aren't that interesting, stop making every character in every book be a writer. Pick one of the other million professions out there.)Did anyone else notice the timing error? Grams started the affair when she was like 40-ish, but couldn't marry the guy until his kids were grown, which happened to be about 35 years later. Did his wife give birth 10 years after she died?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book with well developed characters...","review":"Having lost so much in her life, Jennifer returns to Lake Geneva when faced with the possibility of losing the most important person left in her life - her grandmother, Samantha. As she struggles with her own pain and the uncertainty of her grandmother's condition, Jennifer discovers letters written to her by Sam, that tell of Sam's life and a love story very unexpected. The story weaves in and out of two lives, Jennifer's and Sam's, with strong emotion, a few surprises and terrific characterization.It's written in 1st person and I'm not normally one to read those. I had to get past that initially in this book...but found it easy to do so. The book is best told in first person, and I often felt that Jennifer was telling ME the story of her summer on Lake Geneva. The book easily kept my attention throughout and and there were a few surprises along the way.If you liked Suzanne's Diary, you'll also enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I loved \\"Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas\\" and was hoping that Mr. Patterson would again engage me in a really good story, even if it brought me to tears. That didn't happen here. Instead, I found this book filled with every possible cliche and circumstance, as tho he'd created a list of every imaginable sad scenario, and checked them off as he worked them into this novel. Young, beautiful woman widowed....then a miscarriage...now a beloved grandmother in a coma, with her own life's story to tell via letters....and then a new boyfriend dying of cancer. C'mon! It is so far beneath his talents for a good story, that I can't imagine why he would take the time to write it......unless he simply enjoys laughing all the way to the bank. I read it in less than 2 hours...hoping that he would redeem himself and make it worth my while. Didn't happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulative, but sweet","review":"Worth the $2 I spent on it at the used book sale. (They lost me when the hero brings an electrocuted kitty back to life - oy!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't know about this one...","review":"My mom passed this book on to me with the words, \\"it's a quick read.\\" And I will give her proper credit, it was a quick read. Unfortunately, the plot is far from subversive and the characters are two dimensional at best. The plot while slightly outlandish (woman loses husband and miscarries, then meets a man that is also dying) could technically happen, but I was not emotionally invested in any of these characters. And sadly, I think that is what this book is missing, characters that the reader knows or indentifies with or some sort of level. When I read, I like to think well I know someone like that or I can picture that character. I didn't do that at all in this book. Patterson seldom gets behind typecasted characters to actually create anyone real. I am honestly not sure what could have saved this book, more exposition or details maybe...not a total write off...but nothing spectacular."},{"rating":"2","title":"James Patterson proves himself yet again:)","review":"This was an amazing read. I started it at about two in the afternoon and did not put it down until I was finished. It is a nice reminder that the love we all crave is still out there, in some form. Whether it be in the heart of the author writing it or on the pages of a truly outstanding book. I would recommend this to anyone. It is not like any other James Patterson book I have read but he has proved to me that he can capture his audience with both suspense and romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I agree the book is quick and easy read. But I disagree that it was a romantic tearjerker. It is obvious that Patterson is a man writing about a woman. Before I even started it I figured out the plot, the ending and everything in between. One that really annoyed me was the fact that only one man was in the story with Jennifer and of course they must fall in love. I was surprised in myself, I cry easily over anything romantic and loveydovey - but this did not touch me. He used stories or sayings that are quite trite and disappointed me in lack of imagination. (The jar of sand and rocks - come on how many times have we heard it before) I was hoping for more from such an acclaimed author, but he left me with nothing. I am sure by next week I will have forgotten all about it. If he writes another I am going to pass it by, like I would recommend to others about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't feel anything","review":"Okay, this is a tough one. I didn't like or dislike this story. It just didn't touch me on an emotional level the way \\"Suzanne's Diary\\" did. What it did do was leave me with some questions, however. What exactly was the purpose of these letters anyway? And why were they written in letter form? Why not as a diary? Why write them and never mail them. And wasn't Brenden just a little to good to be true? I'm not much of a \\"romance\\" reader, but it seems that whenever I have read a romance, it almost always takes place at a lake or in a remote cabin near some body of water. Quite the cliché and a bit boring. By the time I got to the end I felt nothing. A bit disappointing, since I normally like Patterson's books. But if you looking for a quick way to waste an afternoon, this might be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tear-jerker...","review":"I thought this was a really nice story. I read it in one sitting, but it was sooo sad. Make sure you have a box of tissues! The setting (Lake Geneva) sounded beautiful. The only problem I had with this book was that it seemed a little rushed. I felt there could have been so much more as far as the actual letters to Jennifer. I figured that'd be the majority of the book, but Sam's story was only a small part.Regardless, it was sweet, and it definitely has been drilled into my head that Jennifer is \\"the most beautiful girl in the world\\"...(it got a bit old after a while). Anyway, aside from the few small downfalls this book has, I do recommend it. It's a great summer story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not particularly moving","review":"It's a nice, fast summer read, and I must admit to shedding a tear or two, but overall, I didn't like it.I don't think I'll be reading more James Patterson. For one thing, he is totally unconvincing as a 35-year-old female. I mean come on. There's this one line about an \\"upside-down ponytail\\" and it almost made me quit reading and throw the book against the wall in frustration. Funny how little things like that can throw off the whole experience. Generally for me, this was not dense enough to be a real romance. Badabing badaboom, they're in love. But why? No one knows.Anyway, if you're in the mood for a fluffy read, you might be ok with this one. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read all the books put out by Patterson...and love the Alex Cross character. This one was over the top. I don't know, it was just too simple. Now granted it was nice to read it in one night after a busy day at work, but it just left me saying , \\"huh\\". Lots of holes, but I guess there were some feel good moments. Like another reviewer wrote, way too many \\"you are gorgeous\\" moments over and over.Agent Cross, we are ready for your return!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Sunday read","review":"I spent a few hours on a Sunday reading this book. When I first heard about it, I immediately put my name on the waiting list at my library. Overall I thought it was good. I had high hopes bcuz 1) it's written by James Patterson, one of favorite authors; 2) I thought it would be similar to Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. I wasn't disappointed. It was nice way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon. But I have to admit, I'm anxiously waiting for the next Alex Cross!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down....","review":"Yes, I'm a very big James Patterson fan, and he didn't let me down. Sam's Letters to Jennifer was great! I couldn't put it down. I love all of Patterson's books but the romantic ones are right up there with my other favorite author, Nicholas Sparks. A must read for any true romantic. Okay, maybe it wasn't as good as Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, but it will go on my shelf as one of my very favorites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF TIME","review":"Thank goodness this was a short book because it was a complete waste of my time. The story was boring and predictable but the worst thing is how VERY POORLY WRITTEN it is. It's like some high school kid wrote it. This Patterson guy needs some writing classes. There is no way I would go near another one of his books again. And I read constantly. Save your time and money on this one. It was terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugary Harlequin Story","review":"If you're a lonely housewife, romantic at heart, and like harlequins, wait for Patterson's book to come out in paperback. It's an easy sugary read, tugging at your heartstrings, but not worth the hardcover price. It also seems to me that Patterson is jumping on a new genre style of writing and \\"literally\\" losing his fans of Alex Cross. He is trying to capitalize on sappy, romantic, tragic, love stories after his success of Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas and picking a touristy, profitable town like Lake Geneva, which he may not even have visited for more than a day, just to sell his books and make more money. I admit I like easy, romantics once in a great while, but a classic writer like Patterson should leave the romantic books to R.W.A (Romance Writers of America). And lastly, he should fire his editor and take writing classes again with all his money. This is not literature; it's choppy, full of basic writing errors, and cliché."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"James Patterson lost his touch in this book. The romance seemed too forced and the plot didn't flow as smoothly as you would expect it would from a Patterson novel. The fact the the reverend is shacking up with a married women is never discussed. Jennifer becomes romantically involved with a man she knew when she was too young to remember him and the apprehensions about becoming involved so recently after her first husband's death are only lightly discussed. The story seems too forced and Patterson should stick to mystery thrillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've ever read","review":"This is by far the worst book I've ever read. To think that trees had to be sacrificed to make this! I'll be brief. It was the most cliched plot I've ever encountered, there was practically no character development, the dialogue was extremely cheesy/poorly written and there was no substance to anything that happened in it. At some point, it reached its apogee of absurdity when the heroine's beau gave her electrocuted cat CPR, after which she fell more deeply in love with him. Utter garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and Unrealistic","review":"This book was an easy, fast read, but the story line was very melodramatic and predictable. There was no depth to the story. The romance was a little too sappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"The only reason this book was enjoyable was because you could read it in one sitting. The chapters were short, unchallenging, and the storyline didn't require much thought.The story felt rushed, and I didn't feel like I got to know the characters very well. I thought there were too many different dramatic things happening at the same time which kept shifting the focus of the story. Throughout the book I was wondering why Jennifer wasn't spending more time with Sam. I also wondered why we weren't told more about Brendan and Jennifer's childhood together.I don't read many James Patterson's books and this one didn't inspire me to pick up another one anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Attempt at Feminine Voice","review":"This book was sappy and awful. Patterson fails at capturing the female voice and presents us with unrealistic, bordering on ridiculous dialogue. Who talks, or even thinks, like this? Jennifer varies between sounding like a teenager with all the italics and exclamation points, and sounding like a Hallmark card. \\"Thank you for sharing the letters with me\\"??? And what a stupid premise. Yay, let's all cheer grandma's fling with the town preacher. Woohoo? Patterson needs to stick with suspense. Both this novel and \\"Suzanne's Diary For Nicholas\\" show that he has no talent for writing romance. He obviously thinks that women think like sentimental morons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"We are presented a letter from \\"Sam\\" and it takes a while to figure out just what relationship is the focus of the letter. Lovely, lovely story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing read!","review":"You know, just when you think Patterson can only write one kind of book, he writes a sweet book like this one. I was pleasantly surprised with this story.It took me a few pages to really get into the plot. I had no idea that there was going to be a slight suspense aspect to it at all. Patterson works his magic that got me hooked on any of his other books. The chapters are a little longer than his books normally have, but we get to read a little bit of Sam's letters every few chapters or so. The letters always end on an interesting cliffhanger.While Sam remains in a coma in the majority of the book, you fall in love with her. Probably even more than you actually like Jennifer. It's hard to like her with all of the emotions that she is going through. The subject matter is pretty sad and there are some tear jerking moments, but the story is overall enjoyable and entertaining. Oh, and addictive, like Lifetime movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good beach book","review":"With all the publicity surrounding this book, I was hoping for a great summer romance--'a woman conquers her greatest fears and overcomes her tentative inclinations in order to love again!' It was a good one night read. It actually seemed like a rough draft of a great book--fine, but not very satisfying.

If I didn't have to lead the group discussion, I would have stopped mid-way. There is nothing interesting..nothing much to talk about! It's a very cool premise--the letter idea, but it goes no where.(Maybe we should write books ourselves!! Just because J. Patterson is well known, this book hits the best sellers' list!!??)The characters aren't well developed and the \\"plot\\" is PREDICTABLE... Don't waste the few hours it takes to read this one... Too many wonderful books out there.

And, try to justify it to her granddaughter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"It is inconceivable that this book would have been printed without the reputable name of James Patterson as author. The plot is simple, the word choice adolescent and the characters are flat and similar; Jennifer is the same as Sam and Brendan is the same as Daniel. I don't take lightly to slamming another writer, yet it is difficult not to when coming across sentences such as these:\\"I was soooo glad to see Brendan's smiling face.\\"\\"...less than three weeks later, something really terrible happened.\\"\\"...my eyes were swollen and very, very red.\\"To use some of Mr. Patterson's own jargon, let me just say: This book is very, very bad.

In the least have someone fact-check the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer","review":"I knew I should have put the book down and not wasted any more of my time when the author writes that Jennifer puts on her husband's Michigan U jogging suit. There is no Michigan U! There is The University of Michigan (U of M) or Michigan State University (MSU). But I unfortunately kept reading only to subject myself to reading the preposterous scene of when Brendan and Jennifer performing CPR on one Of Jennifer's cats and it lives.

I've never read a James Patterson book before so I don't know how his other works are. Personally, I have a love/hate relationship with this book.Like the main character, I also have a lot of happy memories about Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. I live on the west coast now and find myself missing it a lot. So sharing those warm memories and talking about all the places that I remember makes me a little home sick, just like Jennifer (though it's technically not her home).It's also a very sad story, which makes me dislike it. I hate to hear how in such a place that carries warm memories for her that things can change and take a turn for the worse. This is definitly not the typical go to the happy place to feel happy again type of book.Bring your tissues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this tripe an NY Times Bestseller?","review":"Another book that is supposed to make you cry.

Check it our from the library instead of buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful easy read","review":"Patterson's writing style is easy to follow and enjoy. In this latest novel, which is a bit of a departure from most of his other work, we have the story of Jennifer whose grandmother Sam has fallen into a coma and later dies, leaving behind the revelation of a secret passion for a mysterious \\"Doc\\" who taught her how to laugh and love when she was stuck in a hard and boring marriage. In the process, Jennifer re-meets an old friend, Brendan, and a passion of her own is awakened for him. But he's in the fight of his life against cancer. How will that end? This is a memorable story that will stay with you for quite some time, especially if you're a romantic at heart.David rehakauthor of \\"Love and Madness\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, Light Summer Read","review":"Although there is nothing extraordinary about this novel, it is fast-paced, interesting, and SWEET. The characters are well-developed and likeable, despite the momentary gender confusion established in the prologue. Also, because there is no extraneous matter contained in the plot, the book can be savored in just a few hours.Even though I prefer Patterson's Alex Cross mysteries and Women's Murder Club series, SAM'S LETTERS TO JENNIFER was a pleasant departure from the murder and mayhem, and as soul-satisfying as his other love story SUZANNE'S DIARY FOR NICHOLAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful read!","review":"You really need to read this kind of trash books once in a while to be able to fully appreciate good books.

I took the plunge based no my experience with Suzanne's Letters to Nicholas. This book did not bring forth the same reaction from me. I cried and was moved for days based on the before mentioned book. This novel didn't bring me to that place.I appreciated the story but felt it predictable. To be fair, I read Suzanne's at a different time in my life, and perhaps I was more emotional and less jaded toward predictable storylines.In any event, if you were going to select one book to read between Sam's or Suzanne's, I certainly suggest Suzanne's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sam's Letters to Jennifer","review":"This is far from even being a \\"fair read\\". I'm an avid James Patterson fan, but Patterson is riding on the coattails of the tremendous success of \\"Suzanne's Diary\\".

Patterson tells a good with lots of scenic descriptions and makes the characters seem real"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Matter How Many Alphabet Letters are Used, it's Still Bad","review":"Although it is not a sequel to Patterson's masterpiece Suzan's Diary for Nicholas, it is obviously a hastily put together piece trying to cash in on the success of that novel. It fails miserably in its ability to keep you turning the pages, the main character Jennifer is just not that interesting and you really couldn't care less if she makes it with old childhood friend Brendan who like all bad 'chick flick' type books is dying of a disease, in this case a brain tumour. The other main part of the story revolves around Jennifer discovering who the secret mystery lover was of her grandma Sam, who is lying in a coma whose letters Jennifer is now reading. The book is boring and predictable is a severe understatement. It is just not worth spending even one cent on. If you haven't read Suzan's Diary for Nicholas defiantly do so, but forget this rush job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, stupid and predictable","review":"Boring, sappy, stupid and predictable should have been the title for this review.

This book was a little over 260 pages, big type, with his usual short chapters that makes for an impossible to put down book. Needless to say, I was able to finish the book in less than 2 hrs!!! He could have gone into so much more depth on everything, including the letters that were written by Sam, which were an integral part of the book. I was extremely disappointed by the lenth and lack of substance for this book. That being said, if you want a quick read and happen to borrow someone else's copy or find it used, it's worth it, I guess. But it does not even begin to compare to Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas. Someone else mentioned not even bothering with Sam's and just rereading Suzanne's...I may have to agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused from page 1","review":"did anyone notice the masculine pronoun \\"he\\" referring to Sam on the first few pages??? then, when the call from the nursing home came, sam was no longer a \\"he\\" but a she! i must've re-read the first 5 pages at least 10x, wondering if i was seeing things!!! editting mistakes like that, right out of the gate, are totally bogus. i never bothered reading further!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Merely a short story","review":"I found this \\"novel\\" to be one of the poorest I have read to date. The characters are not developed, the story line was weak and it lacked imagination. It seemed as if Mr. Patterson stopped by a bar one night and jotted it down on a napkin! It should have been labeled as no more than a short story.I believe the last time I read a book with such a large font, two inch margin on all four sides and less than 200 words per page ---- I was in the third grade!!

By the time I realized I had already read it I was well into it, I figured, well, I have already read it, but it's a Patterson, so it will be a good read. Well I am throwing it out so I don't do this again!! Don't write from a woman's perspective. You don't HAVE a woman's perspective, i.e. \\"voice\\"!

I could only assume that everyone at the house party featured in the book was mildly retarded because sane members on the Ton in the Regency would never have behaved or spoken as they did in this book. Furthermore, the characters had little to no depth and even less consistency in their motivations and emotions. The dialog was stilted and the events most contrived. For such a well-publicized Regency author, very poor show! Frankly, and I'm sorry to sound so dramatic, I'm simply stunned that her editor/publishing house allowed this to pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Says","review":"The sound quality is great and takes you back to the days when Doo-Wop was at it's height.

The Secret of Red Gate Farm was my favorite of all the books in the series. What better setting could there be for a mystery story than an old farm way out in the country where members of a strange cult dressed in white and danced on moonlit nights on a distant hillside? Nancy felt a need to find out what was going on, and you will, too. Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling drama","review":"Dot Com is a compelling drama focused on a small company based in NYC. It slyly incorporates the processes by which the SEC and The Street work, regulating businesses. Multiple threads of plot are interwoven, in a foxy manner. Character's personalities come to life and complement the story. Settings in NYC, Washington DC, and VT (among many) ring true. It is clear the author is a foodie, appreciating a good restaurant meal as part of the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This is a novel is remarkable considering the amazing job that Stahl does in climbing inside the mind of Roscoe Arbuckle to lay out this \\"memoir\\". What makes the book as compelling and entertaining is the fact that is the structured around very real events. The book is laid out in short little bursts of story (1-5 pages each) as Arbuckle recounts his entire life in brief anecdotes. Many of the characters are real; you run into Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, and other famous Hollywood types both onscreen and off. You also get to go on the roller coaster that was the scandal that took everything away from him at the height of his career. I've read some of Stahl's other works and this is certainly his best. This may be my favorite book I read all summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Hollywood History at it's best...","review":"Being a native San Franciscan, I've always been fascinated by the \\"real\\" backstory on the Arbuckle scandal. Jerry Stahl's novel takes you back to a time where the true person and his/her Tinseltown facade were as separate as California is from Florida. The first-person narrative style is great, told in the \\"lingo\\" of the day. I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"The only thing I didn't like about this book is that there are so many characters. I can't remember all my co-workers' names, so I had a hard time tracking everyone. But you've got to consider that the book covers almost an entire lifetime of one human being. We all know more people than we realize.Overall, it was a good read. The rollercoaster of sadness and happiness is a great illustration of what life is really like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe soon a movie?","review":"Arbuckle wasn't the greatest but he was the first comic superstar. He was just a great clown and a really nice guy who went from a tragic childhood to stardom and back to tragedy. There is some tremendous writing here, such as \\"What do you do when the world thinks you're a monster and you know it's the world that is monstrous.\\" Stahl also scores with, \\"Everything he lost came back except the delusion that it was really his and the belief that it mattered.\\" Much of this portrait of Arbuckle is conjecture but it is a very believable and sympathetic portrait.If this book becomes a movie then I suggest that Roscoe can be played by Oliver Platt or Kevin James with John Goodman as his psychotic Dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful, True to Life HIstorical Novel","review":"I, Fatty is a truly wonderful read. Loving silent film and partial to historical novels, I expected to enjoy this novel; not only did I thoroughly enjoy it, but as I read the final page I felt happy in the knowledge that Stahl - more than 80 years after the fact - had given Roscoe Arbuckle a voice with which to comment on the horror show that passed for a fair trial.Vibrant writing is enhanced by thorough research of the silent film era and its star, with Stahl recreating the era, vividly capturing both the naivete and decadence of early Hollywood. You don't have to be a silent film fan to enjoy and appreciate this well-written, fast paced novel; I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it better","review":"A lot of country stars used to sing \\"covers\\" of songs originally performed by others, and the results were usually not as good. Here, Jerry Lee Lewis sings a lot of old \\"standards\\" which technically are \\"covers\\" but with his unique vocal style and piano playing, it winds up being a new creation well worthy of attention. I originally bought both LP records containing the music on this CD, and they are two of my most treasured records of Jerry Lee's country period, which I think is his best genre. It is nice to have the CD so I can retire them from active playing. If you like the old standards, you will like the way Jerry Lee does them, I'm sure. I think he has more musical talent than any other performer of his generation and could have been greater than Elvis had he not made a few PR mistakes or if Elvis had not been so sexy looking to the women. But then again, he wouldn't have been Jerry Lee Lewis, the Icon.

The older one he was shot cause they though he was a zombie, and they never found him in the celler.

I watched the first half hour, then had to switch to my DVD of this movie because I couldn't see at all what was happening in the movie.Shame on Twilight Time for releasing the worst looking bluray in my collection. Buyer beware. Search out the DVD vs Blu comparison screenshots if you need to they're accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistake","review":"Comparing to '1968 George A. Romero's version, remake seems banal. That's the effect of changing the script. After watching the original Night Of The Living Dead watching remake is pointless: Savini is not as good director as Romero, and the tension is unfortunately not the same... What's good in this movie? Patricia Tallman as Barbra is truly charming, and make up of zombies is just excellent. But the script is, as i said, much worse than original and all movie is much less scary. There are pure american black&white characters, when in original characters were much more complicated (especially Ben and Barbra). So, if you haven't seen this movie, I suggest you to see NOTLD'1968 -Romero's original. I saw sequel before seeing original: it seemed really good to me, but when I saw Romero's version...I was shocked. Two different movies, two different classes.

This remake adds humor to the story and have the standard naive american view on people as either good or bad. One of the most interesting things with the original was that it showed that the hero became as evil as the monsters he fought against.

We have just seen it hundreds of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak film","review":"I don't care if those zombies look real or not, this film isn't particularly scary. It's moderately suspenseful, but has no eerie scenes that raise the hair on the back of your neck. And despite what many others say, I still think the zombies in Day of the Dead are a better looking design then this Night of the Living Dead remake. Most of the problem in this film is the acting. The only one that's actually good is Tony Todd as the hero, Ben. His character remains mostly calm and cool and tries to help the others with him. However, the rest of the cast I can't say much. Patricia Tallman was not bad but also wasn't very good.

Savini had Romero on board as a producer and really did not deviate from the original NOTLD. He found a way to mordernize the film and stay true to it's integrity. He did change things a little mostly the ending but did it a way that left Romaro fans very happy. Savini's respect for George Romero is seen in this remake. Weather it is Martin or Dawn of the dead the Savini/Romero team really shine. The movie opens much like the original and stay's remotely close to the original movie for most of the film. Of course Savini throws in his own changes and the final plot twist is different from the original NOTLD. Savini show's promise as a horror movie director here and as always the special affects are great for the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"If the media truely was non-dogmatic...","review":"If the media truely was non-dogmatic, and everyone truely had equal opportunity, then this movie would win best movie award for the year of 1990.Thankfully, the media is VERY one sided, they only give you more diversity within one of MANY sides.

I like this remake just a little more than the original. The reason I like this one more is because of Patricia Tallman's character. She doesn't whine the whole time as the lead female did in the original. She's right alongside Tony Todd's character kicking Zombie[s]! That's the other reason I like this film better. Tony Todd. A better lead could not have been casted! He does a wonderful job.As far as just how scary this movie is, I think the original was a little scarier. The reason I think this is because I believe that the dreadful feeling and sense of helplessness was captured better in black and white. Don't get me wrong though, as this remake does offer up many scares.One reason I think this is such a classic is that it's completely original. Seven strangers boarded up in an old farm house, while zombies are all around, trying to get in and eat them. I can't think of many situations that could be more terrifying!

Unfortunately there isn't a good DVD put out that gives this movie much care for by adding a great digital picture, clear soundtrack and cool bonus features that most DVD's have today. Maybe nearing the 2010 mark there will be a \\"collector's edition\\" or something to mark the 20th anniversary. I still can't believe Netflix doesn't have this movie in their library.

The movie overall is creepy and wastes no time in getting to the good stuff. Of course in most horror movies there isn't much of a storyline but if you wanted a storyline you wouldn't be watching a horror flick.

I'd expect this from someone outside the genre but not a guy like Savini!I'm currently fearing the remakes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and both Dawn and Day of the Dead! All 3 are getting remade and I fear what will become of these classic films.

Romero's dialogue is awful, and isn't help by some of the terrible performances (esp. Tom Towles). What I was looking forward to was better special effects than the original due to the bigger budget. The fx sucks. The zombies are boring and the blood looks brownish (chocolate syrup again?) You'd think with Savini behind the camera, the effects would have played an important role in the film (ala Chris Walas' Fly sequel). But the zombie's look like a bunch of drunks. I know that this film had to be cut to get a R rating, but I've seen much gorier films from the 80s. I watched this movie for the second time after seeing Day of the Dead a few days before, and there's no comparison between this and Romero's superior film.

The new movie, The leading lady is actually worth something. She gets tough and kicks butt. The first movie, she is so air headed (not that I blame her) I just couldn't stand it. See this and you should see the first one but this one is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Zombie Film","review":"I like the fact that this film actually invokes some fear in me. The zombies are realistic and relentless. The people involved will not all work together because they have no clue as to how to handle the situation. So the struggle between those trying to fight the zombies, and those simply hiding in fear of them adds to the great plot.Tony Todd enhances his role and makes the film believable. He is serious and calculating about what to do and drawns you into the movie. You will want to keep watching to see how everything turns out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good edition of a good remake","review":"In this edition of Night 90, you get a great behind the scenes feature which includes a few deleted scenes.

They said that if Savini had not removed those head shots, the film would have gotten an X rating instead of an R rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Savini astounds with Romero's updated script.","review":"I was so skeptical about this that it was out for years before I ever saw it. Why bother remaking a classic? Well, because frankly it fixes the things that bugged me in the original. Barbra has been transformed from a comatose gimp to a heroine who rises from her initial shock to find more strength than she ever knew she had. The acting is great! I watched the original again last night, and I must say that the acting alone is worth remaking it. The conflict between Ben and Cooper makes a bit more sense this time around. Ben's fate, which was needed in the original, gets a satisfying twist, but Cooper's fate is even better. WOW! Classic lines like \\"Here's another one for the fire\\" get a stunning spin. The lighting is too bright and I must admit some of the creepiness of the original depended on shadows in black and white, but that doesn't keep me from loving this fantastic remake.

A classic love triangle with some interesting twists and turns.The roommate situation between Judd and Jackman really helpsdevelop the romance between their characters.The ending was as expected but that was just fine with me!This movie is great romantic movie to watch on the couch with a bowl of popcorn and a good friend.

The DVD was in perfect condition, amazing price, fabulous vendor. If this film was not, in fact, shot in YOUR building, I would not go there. At all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good actors, awful script","review":"I was warned that this was a bad movie but rented it anyway, figuring that a movie with Ashley Judd, Hugh Jackman, Greg Kinear, and Marisa Tomei could not be all bad. I was wrong, wrong, wrong!The story is disjointed and pointless; the characters were terribly underdeveloped and shallow. None of them were really very likeable, especially the men.I realize that the movie was from the book \\"Animal Husbandry\\" but the cow and bull stuff just did not work. The whole movie was just plain excruciating.What also did not work was the love triangle, perhaps because both men were slimy weasels. Who would want either of them, cute though they are?There are many better romantic comedies out there......unfortunately I cannot put this movie into that category."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MAGNIFICENT CHICK FLICK.","review":"Hugh Jackman is magnificent. Very handsome and irresistable. Someone like you is a movie about a woman named Jane (Judd) who thought she had figured out what was wrong with men until she met Mr. Right. Very predictable and cute movie. A MAGNIFICENT CHICK FLICK."},{"rating":"2","title":"The new cow theory!","review":"Broken hearted Jane develops her \\"new cow theory\\" about men; meaning that a man prefers being with a new woman and will always dump the old one. Through the funny details of the movie and with friends' help (I won't ruin the pleasure of you finding out for yourself, by providing more details), Jane faces her pain and finds out that she can still find true love, the only analgesic for heartache.The idea of starting over and admitting that not all men are faulty is very refreshing. After all, we women are the delusional ones who insist on pretending that the frog we're kissing is a knight and we place him on a white horse, then we act shocked when we find out he is still a frog.The theme of the movie alone makes up for the cheesy performance and deserves 3 stars. Admittedly though, I am a shallow woman, and for the raw pleasure of seeing Hugh Jackman with his shirt off (even though he still looked great with his shirt on), I changed it to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Like You","review":"This movie is just what it appears to be, a fun entertaining way to spend an evening. The premise of the New Cow Theory is funny brought on by being dumped by a man yet again. Ashley Judd always provides the audience with an excellent performance. It doesn't matter what role she tackles, it is always solidly done. What a choice - being able to choose from Greg Kinnear and Hugh Jackman! It would be a no lose situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally cute","review":"This is a great little romantic comedy. Ashley Judd is adorable and Hugh Jackman and Greg Kinnear are perfect. The most hilarious part of the film is the fake psychologist Judd creates to put forth her comparison of humans to cattle, comparing man's polygamous mating drive to that of a bull. Some genuine laughs and a heartwarming romance. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute film","review":"I'm a huge Ashley Judd fan and this was just a fun chick flick. Her acting skills are kinda lost on the fluff, but still a good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Entertaining","review":"I don't typically watch romantic comedies but this one was pretty entertaining. I doubt many guys would want to watch this but if you love romantic comedies definitely add this one to your viewing list.Ashley Judd plays the main part well and if you came to this movie because Hugh Jackman is in it (like myself) you'll be happy to know he gets more screen time than Greg Kinnear and has a couple shirtless scenes ;)All in all it's a cute movie worth the watch"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Judd Miss","review":"Saw the film because, to date, have enjoyed all this Judd's films. Big disappointment.The opening of the film was promising. Thought I would be entertained with the \\"cow\\" theory. But the film went flat quickly and much time was spent bashing men (and their inability to be faithful to - or even desire only - one) throughout the film. 5-10 minutes of this would have been enough. But an entire film resting solely on this theme gets old.She's beautiful and interesting to watch on film, but even a date with a great man can't make up for this miss. I found myself cringing with each line and new scene dedicated to exploring this premise.The previews looked interesting, and like many comprise the only slightly funny moments in the film.I did enjoy the soundtrack, however...."},{"rating":"2","title":"*faints* Hugh Jackman...*swoons*","review":"After watching a few trailers online and hearing the words, \\"cows\\" and \\"Hugh Jackman\\" together in less than 3 minutes apart, it got me hooked even before I watched the movie. *laughs* Anyway, this is a romantic comedy starring Ashley Judd (Jane Goodall) who falls in love with Greg Kinnear (Ray) and ends up getting her heart broken by that jerk. Her womanizing roomate, Hugh Jackman (Eddie) gives her advice and a shoulder to cry on, and also helps inspire her to write in a collumn in a newspaper about how men are like cows (weird, I know...). Jane ends up falling in love with Eddie in the end, and it's the sweetest thing ever. The ending sort of came in a big rush, like they were trying to wrap things up early, but heh it was still good. Hugh Jackman was absolutely amazing in this movie, and I feel like slapping myself for not learning about him sooner. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"An endearing romantic comedy...","review":"Star quality and old-fashioned sex-appeal are the highlights of Someone Like You, a fairly predictable romantic comedy than nonetheless tugs at the heartstrings with surprising effectiveness. Ashley Judd is Jane, a talent-booker for a talk show host who has her heart broken by the show's producer (Greg Kinnear). To spite her ex, Jane moves in with Eddie (Hugh Jackman) another staffer who needs a roommate. The results, of course, are predictable. We all know that Jane and Eddie are bound for romance, but the screen-sizzle between Judd and Jackman is more than worth it. Also worth the price are the special features on the DVD, which include an alternate ending which, thankfully, was not used.While Someone Like You won't win any points for originality, it does score big-time for romance and chuckles. While it's definitely not Oscar-quality, it is probably worth owning, especially for the occasional romantic date night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two words... Hugh Jackman","review":"I loved this film. Tony Goldwyn (yes, he's related) directs Ashley to a wonderful level in this film. Greg Kinnear is smarmy and good at it (who knew.. he's always the nice guy.. no longer). Ellen Barkin is ever beautiful and scene stealing. But, like I said up top... Hugh Jackman. This man is going to be a huge star. He has done a few films, and he will do many more.

As a 27 year old woman I could relate to the plotline and have had similar experiences and thoughts as Judd's character in the film. A movie any single woman could relate to and get a good laugh the whole way though. Judd's performance was empathetic and charming. I also liked her chemistry with both romantic leads and would have been happy with seeing her end up with either one. Her theory on \\"cows\\" and as they relate to humans was incredibly entertaining and at points seemingly true and that is what made the movie so relatable and entertaining...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain cute...","review":"Hugh Jackman is so handsome, and Ashley Judd is so funny, you will love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Perfomances!","review":"Not a great film nor is it very original but Someone Like You is a very charming look at trying to find Mr Right. Ashley Judd looks breathtaking and takes her role and gives her the right amount of strength, charm, and intelligence in what could have a been a very boring pathetic role. Greg Kinnear does what he can with a badly written role. Hugh Jackman is charming and likeable as the womanizing roomate of Ashely Judd. The chemistry between the two is amazing and it's the one thing that really carries the film. I only wish the film focused more on the relationship between these two then between the relationship between Ashley and Greg. It has a predictable and happy ending and is certain to please all lovers of romantic comedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we say - Character & Relationship Development","review":"I picked this because of Hugh and Ashley.

I wasn't expecting a blockbuster of a movie, or anything, but MY GOODNESS, this movie was awful! One could ask themselves, \\"What's wrong with this movie?\\" But the answer itself is the very broad question, \\"What isn't?\\" Ashley Judd plays strong, sexy women very well, but she does NOT convince me when she plays a character whom is heart-broken and borderline desperate.Not only is Judd's character not believable, the actual plot pertaining to men behaving like cows who need many \\"places\\" to plant their seeds is just stupid. There are about a million and a half romantic comedies that are better than this, and I recommend all of them wholeheartedly over this joke of a film.Watch A Walk to Remember instead. Although not the best movie ever, it's a heck of alot better than this drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent,","review":"When I first started watching this movie I was not impressed.

It made no sense, but it was beautiful. This film is a fun way to spend a couple hours with your honey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashley Does Comedy Well","review":"This is the first movie I've seen Ashley Judd do comedy in & I thought she did a fantastic job. Judd plays Jane Goodale, the producer of a talk show, who gets dumped by Ray (Greg Kinnear). In her time of relationship mourning she develops The New Cow Theory which explains that like cows, men grow tired of women after they \\"get\\" them & move on to a \\"new cow.\\" Based on Laura Zigman's book, Animal Husbandry, the screen adaptation was cutely done. Ashley Judd & Hugh Jackman have great on-screen chemistry and Greg Kinnear does a great job of playing an annoying ex-boyfriend. If you're looking for a light, romantic-comedy this movie is perfect for you. It's simple entertainment, with some cute male-female concepts. As long as you don't take it too seriously & appreciate it for what it is, I think you'll like it.

Oriah speaks to the reader with absolute honesty - on her relationships, her family, work, fears and hopes of everyday life - and how she deals with it. I particularly liked what she said about finding your 'word' or the one word around which inner dynamics evolve. And her clarity/differentiation between ego and essence is incredible, a noteworthy approach to practical spirituality needed for modern times.This is definitely not for the average self help person or someone who just wants to 'make it work' with ten points on how-to- it is more for those of us who struggle with finding inner peace and authenticity in all that we do. Also the author has a very verbose style of writing that may not appeal to many - particularly those who are not very word-oriented and that might be something to watch for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing to say the least","review":"I read the first two books by the same author \\"The Invitation\\" and \\"The Dance\\" and very much enjoyed them.

Before illness defined Fox, he was known as being quick and charming, quirky and brainy. Doc Hollywood showcases all that I love about the actor.This is also very much an ensemble movie. The town's inhabitants are ridiculously charming. David Ogden Stiers shines brightly as the mayor of a small town. You have Woody Harrelson in a hilarious role as an insurance agent and Bridget Fonda doing southern like no one should ever do again.

In the movie, the town is named Grady, SC. However, the movie was actually filmed in Micanopy, FL, the oldest inland-town in Florida, and as much an old southern town as you will ever find anymore. Its houses on the main street are still like in the movie and in the beginning of last century. Big live oaks form canopies over the roads. An 1890 warehouse is home to the historical museum, where you can see displays of life in town over the centuries and the filming of Doc Hollywood. The charm of the movie depends in large part on this beautiful scenery, and it is still there to explore.Doc Hollywood"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Fox's better work","review":"It is a real shame that illness has struck down Michael Fox. I only hope that things will change for the better for him. Anyway, While I liked his Back to the Future Series. Doc Hollywood is far and beyond the better film.

It's not even worth the cheap price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant entertainment","review":"There are two points that you should note before you buy this DVD. First, there is one nude scene. Second, the production quality has not been enhanced, and there are no special features on this DVD.HOWEVER, I love this movie. Michael J. Fox is hilarious as well as convincing. The supporting cast is beautifully quirky, deceptively complex and interesting. There is a stunning contrast between the Washington DC hospital where Dr. Stone completes his training (violent & tumultuous), the small southern town that he is trying to escape (serene & friendly) and the LA plastic surgery practice that he wants to join(cold & impersonal).While serving as the small town's GP, he learns through his interactions with the locals that living in a peaceful town is a quality of life choice - not a horrible fate for those that don't know better. I can watch this one over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my most often-watched DVDs","review":"This was the third DVD I ever bought, simply because it was inexpensive. It is a wonderful movie with great characters, and I have watched it at least as often as any other DVD in my collection. Very enjoyable. Be forewarned, however, that the DVD transfer quality is very poor. The first time I watched it, I was surprised when I saw \\"lint\\" on the picture in some frames! You can forgive that when you remember how little you paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Widescreen","review":"This is not a jab at Amazon, as Doc Hollywood is NOT available from Warner Bros. in anything other than full-screen, but how any studio can continue to sell full-screen-ONLY DVDs is beyond me. It's unforgivable. I won't even go into the inconvenience of the Warner snap-cases. I mistakenly read the specs and bought (and returned) this movie. If you expect to keep your 4:3 SD television for the next 10 years, and don't mind that you're missing about 1/3 of the original shot, then here's the movie for you. I really enjoy this movie, but I will not buy a 4:3 movie that wasn't shot originally in this format. As of Feb. 2009, standard analog (and I hope most 4:3 content) will migrate to widescreen/HD TV. All movies should offer a widescreen option. This, in my opinion, is the only positive outcome of the Blu-ray/HD-DVD conflict... but that's another story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned twice","review":"WHEN I RECEIVED MY FIRST \\"DOC HOLLYWOOD DVD\\" I WAS UNABLE TO HEAR THE MOVIE, THEN I REQUESTED TO HAVE IT REPLACE AND WHEN I GOT IT THE 2ND TIME IT WAS THE EXACLY THE SAME PROBLEM.

He gets off the highway to avoid a traffic jam, but gets lost and ends up crashing into a fence in the small town of Grady. He is sentenced to 32 hrs of community service at the local hospital. All he wants is to serve the sentence and get moving, but gradually the locals become attached to the new doctor, and he falls for the pretty ambulance driver, Lou. \\"Doc Hollywood\\" is an excellent movie and very well done. The comedy is very good throughout the movie and the characters are all very interesting. This is a feel-good, fun movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been better.","review":"i liked the film good story fun bunch of colorful people, but now the down side the bad nudity for one & lauguage for another. minus those things it's a great picture, when i saw it on television i love it the edited version aka airline cut so if you get a chance to see on tv than i recommend doing so personally i think that's the way it should have been released in movie houses in the first place. but if you still want this version i'd recommend that people over the age of 13 can see this. parents may want to view this film first before letting your family watch this. i know i'm old fashioned but it better to be safe than sorry if you know i mean. i would actually buy the edited version of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"good movie could use sub-titles","review":"Overall this movie is still pretty funny and witty and colorful. Having lived in the South for the last 4 years I can appreciate this movie more than when I saw it first when it was released in theaters. The accent of the characters in the movie is really thick, though, and the DVD could definitely use sub-titles, at least in English, but it does not have any. In fact there are zero special features here, the main menu does not even have the standard background with a movie still but a giant WB logo with two options: Play and Chapter Index. Some production notes would have been nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doc Hollywood","review":"I was disappointed with the nudity in the movie---I guess the version I had originally seen and enjoyed was edited for tv---I had to throw the dvd I bought in the trash---guess I need to be more careful about what I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney at His Best","review":"There's not much to say about this product.

The movie is based on the fairy tale written by Carlo Collodi. One could easily say that Pinocchio can be included in the golden days of Dinsey animated movies and can easily be compared in quality with the likes of Bambi, Dumbo and Snowwhite. The animation is astounding and to imagine that ít was drawn by hand is amazing. \\"When you wish upon a star\\" is a timeless classic and this movie will be seen by generations of children to come.

Not only was this transfer taken from unrestored film elements but they optically enlarged the picture to fill a 16:9 HD screen. By changing the original 1.33:1 aspect ratio to 1.85:1, they managed to cut off the top and bottom of the picture, resulting in a very grainy image.With no extras other than the original theatrical trailer, my question is: What qualifies this to be a \\"Gold Edition\\"? My advise is, pay a few extra dollars and get the newest edition, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAY JUST BE WALT'S VERY BEST","review":"Everybody has a different Disney favorite but Pinoccio is surely mine. This is the stuff of childhood dreams (and nightmares also). Personally I think this is the one animated movie with the biggest heart of all.

I was so excited to hear it was being released on DVD. Heck, I was happy just to hear any classic Disney animation was going to be finally released on DVD. However, what disappoints me is that this DVD seems to be thrown together without any extra effort put in it to make it special. The DVD version is not in widescreen (like the laserdisk versions are) and it is missing \\"the making of\\" that is found on the VHS version. Why are these things missing and why are we paying more for the DVD version without any of the extras practically found on all other DVDs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It's not my # 1 favorite Disney flick but Pinocchio is good.

But it's up to Pinocchio to finish Geppetto's wish of him becoming a real boy. If Pinocchio can prove himself brave, truithful, and unkind, he will be a real boy. Even though he has the help of Jiminy Cricket, Pinocchio gets sidtracked. And when Geppetto is swallowed by a whale, it's up to Pinocchio to save the day.The great thing about the \\"Walt Disney Gold Collection\\" is that they include special features weather they are on video or DVD. \\"Pinocchio\\" has \\"A Wish Come True: The Making of Pinocchio.\\" So if you bought the video when it first came out, you may consider buying it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not play on American DVD players","review":"I bought this disk for my daughter's birthday and she was heartbroken when we sat down to watch only to discover that this is actually a DVD imported from England and therefore will not play on a standard American DVD player.

I originally saw it during its initial theatrical release when I was a child. I maintain that the detail in the scenes is amazing. The clocks in Gepetto's shop are a wonderful experience itself. The detail that was put into these early hand drawn animated features is flawless. I just can't immagine any one today doing all that work on any film. Now all that work is done with computers and although the films look wonderful, there is something magical about an old hand drawn Disney flick. The updating of the film onto Blu-ray is amazing. It is clear and sparkles.

Gepetto is shown smoking in bed. Many of the characters smoke. Young boys are brought -- as a treat -- to a place where they can smoke, \\"drink\\" (something frothy like beer or root beer), and act very destructively as much as they want. The boys are tricked into thinking this is a fun place to go but are turned into donkeys and sold to work in mines -- never again to see their families. In the end, old Gepetto does get his wish. Pinocchio is a real boy. And old Gepetto gets to share his bed with the young boy.

But as an adult I have had time to reevaluate this story and it's effect on our children. This movie contains too much violence and way too much fantasy for our children to handle. With all of it's fluff and happy themes, how can you show this to our children when there is so much suffering in the world? I think its grossly unfair to the children of other countries who are dying of starvation or war for our own children to enjoy something so blatently moralizing. I believe that there are some religious undertones in the story as well that should have been kept in check. Please, for our children's sake and future, avoid this harmful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Puppet Show","review":"This certainly is not one of my favorite Disney movies.

It is a charming, entertaining and funny movie for the whole family. The only downsize that I found for this movie is that it is too expensive for the features it includes. There's just the original theatrical trailer, which is just a scene of the movie, which is not something you will die to see. I think Disney could have include a short documentary of how the idea of Pinocchio was conceived, or the origins of the story, or maybe a video of when you whish upon a star as they did with Snow White's Some day my Prince will come and maybe a cartoon, just something to compensate the price.

So took NO racial or other implications away from the movie and the word \\"Slave\\" NEVER occurred in the show!

Pinocchio is one of the best Disney accomplishments so i would presume the Blu ray would bring it justice...however we civilians are denied the right to view this masterpiece in it's 1080p full-screen or wide-screen glory we are forced to view Pinocchio with black side bars because some genius wants everyone to view the movie the \\"Right\\" way (a 1.33:1 ratio) rather than the natural 16x9 ratio of our TV)...apparently no one told the Disney staff there was plenty of room on the disk to have the full-screen, wide-screen, and this blu ray studio first \\"Disney view\\" I recommend the movie based on its value as a masterpiece but this new found idea called \\"Disney View\\" is quite upsetting and will probably ruin the lovely Snow white! soon to be released btw"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinocchio DVD","review":"This new DVD set is wonderful.

I never did get the promised video from that crook and so I stopped ordering anything outside the Amazon.com system for a long time and I still do not like the idea of ordering outside the system.

Jiminy Cricket should've won an Oscar! He is the true heart and soul of the film. He is very, very funny!!! Some might say that Pinocchio is the best. But he comes off as an idiotic little brat/punk.

It is however interesting to note the early appearance of themes that were to dominate later Lawrence works. In particular, the nature-civilisation dichotomy, which became a Lawrence trademark, is apparent here in the relationship between the cultured, educated narrator and his best friend, the raw-boned but affable farmer, George.Readers wishing to introduce themselves to Lawrence would be better advised to start with the book published two years later, and that marked the beginning of his literary reputation: \\"Sons and Lovers\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A complete overhaul...","review":"As always, the book is better, but this film does a fairly decent job of getting the point across. All the essential plot elements remain: Johnny Smith gets into an automobile accident, Johnny Smith goes into a five year coma, Johnny Smith wakes up to discover that his entire life is just about gone (girlfriend gone, job gone, legs just about useless), but in a way God has thrown him a bone by giving him the power of second sight with a simple touch of someone's hand. All the touching, heartwarming details of story remain. It's still an extremely sad story about a life gone terribly wrong, and a man's slow decent into lonely madness, and there's no doubt that this is Christopher Walken's immortal classic performance. As always, though, I beg you to read the novel first.Oh, yeah, and the music is great too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Thriller","review":"This is one of the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel.

All the actors -- Watch for Herbert Lom (Chief Inspector Dreyfus from the Pink Panther movies) in a straight role. Colleen Dewhurst in a tiny cameo. Christopher Walken is perfect -- he does weird so well. And Martin Sheen as a glad-handing politician. Great story and neat twist at the end. Couldn't recommend it more, tho too scary for little ones.

Usually I prefer it when a movie attempts to be true to the book, except when the book is written by King. King is an excellent author, but his books do not translate to film very well.The Dead Zone is a prime example of a great book that made a boring movie. There isn't enough character development to make you care what's going on. This is one case where they should have focused on one aspect of the book and left the rest out.Christopher Walken is the one reedeming factor in this movie. There is one scene where Walken gets angry and you catch a preview of some of his future roles. If you're a Christopher Walken fan then that one scene is worth the price of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's fair","review":"This movie wasn't that great but it's one that was relatively close to the book, unlike a lot of them.

I think he made a serious and crucial decision to take this part of Johnny Smith in Stephen King's novel The Dead Zone. And it paid off very well for him. Christopher Walken in my opinion is a Class AAA actor. I like just about anything Stephen King has wrote and was glad to see this one turned into a movie. And what a great supporting cast to boot. Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosemary from Laguna Niguel, CA","review":"The Dead Zone is the first time I have viewed a motion picture that was better then the novel-far better. The music and the photograpy built a haunting atmosphere with a touch of sadness.All the characters in the film were outstanding, but the key to the story was Chris Walken's performance. Until he played this role, I had never visualized how a magical gift that helps others could become a curse.Two visuals in the film made me appreciate the creativity of Chrononbergs work and demonstrated the power of film over words.1. The moment Walken touches someone hand and the impact of the vision becomes viseral and physical.2. The scene where Walken views the crime on the gazebo. The fact that he can see the crime unfold but can not stop it is almost painful but exhilerating to watch for it's mastery.Last, but not least, the scene where Walken confronts Colleen Duhurst with the word \\"You Knew\\" is stunning.I never get tired this masterpiece and Walken's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"In good hands","review":"I just watched this film again for the first time since it was new.

Outstanding performence from Walken Along with THE DEER HUNTER & THE DOGS OF WAR this is another classic from Christopher Walken.

The premise of this book, that we should pay more attention to the emotional lives of boys, isn't exactly a trailblazer, considering the degree to which we've re-evaluated sex roles in recent decades.

This book helped me fill in those long-forgotten gaps of knowledge -- just in time to better understand my rapidly growing son :) Even though this book does concentrate almost exclusively on a 'stereotypical boy' (i.e., a jock or an angry dropout), it is an invaluable resource for everyone, especially teachers and parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have a son or you're a man, read this book","review":"One of the top ten of the zillions of books I have read in my life.

It is so thoroughly detailed on collections of writings and covers wide range of categories from periods of time in America to race and ethnicity to rights among both genders. It is also easier to read because there is the information about the author(s) before each writing so I can easily imagine what life was like for women in certain periods of time, being the minorities, in employment, etc. Go read this book as soon as possible and feel what women in the writings go through and what the authors want us to interpret."},{"rating":"2","title":"consummate romp of wacky madcap hijinks.","review":"Hulk Hogan's previous acting endeavors like \\"No Holds Barred\\" and a guest appearance on \\"The A-Team\\", not to mention his cameo in the beginning of \\"Rocky 3\\" do not even begin to prepare you for this piece of celluloid gold.

He gives helpful inspirational moral lessons throughout the film, not unlike the '80s kiddie shows of the time \\"He-Man\\" and \\"She-Ra.\\" The difference being,those shows were only a half hour,and actually enjoyable. In one cringe-worthy scene, Lloyd and Duvall are on the verge of making love. Yes,one day the kids will ask where babies will come from, but this scene will make them celibate.

It's classic horror-movie stuff with a twist: unlike most Hollywood horror flicks, the characters look and talk like real people, and as the story progresses, you actually root for them to win. The last horror flick I saw where I didn't cheer for the monsters was the original 'Night of the Living Dead' (1969). The cast makes the people of Perfection real to us, and the dialogue is as sharp and funny as the best Mel Brooks movie. The action is fast-paced, but the tone is always positive. This film is great fun; I never get tired of watching it. Be sure to check out the \\"Making of...\\" feature and the original ending; excellent documentaries from the film-makers.

With some preparation I can easily repeat, word-for-word, the entire movie (I'm working on adding the extra footage provided by the wonderful DVD edition) as well as inject the \\"edited for TV\\" voice overs. Why have I done this? Just read ALL of the reviews below mine. As for someone saying it rips off \\"Dune,\\" they're wrong. What similarities it does have are an homage to that great movie and book. This is a movie of \\"the little things.\\" As I continue to watch it, I keep finding new things that make me laugh. And I'll never stop laughing... \\"'Round here? Heh heh heh! No ma'am!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh out loud funny","review":"I thought this movie was hilarious. The two main characters Val and Earl were the best part. Everytime they tried to leave Perfection, something would stop them. \\"We just waited one day too long to leave\\"The 'Graboids' are voracious eaters who travel through dirt like fish through water. They sense vibrations caused by those walking on top, reminiscent of the giant worms from Dune. They then come to the surface and have a snack.Great movie. Not really scary, no sex or profanity. Good for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"The biggest problem with this movie in blu ray is that the monsters look more fake the clearer the movie is."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's time for a SNAKEOID EDITION of this classic!","review":"Generally, I hate when studios issue 3 or 4 editions of any given film. There are exceptions of course, when the extra material is voluminous or when the film transfer is improved. I feel the time has come for an all-new Snakeoid Edition of this one. For one thing, the current dvd is NOT anamorphic - that should definitely be taken care of, with a fresh widescreen remaster and Dolby Digital EX 5.1. A commentary track would also turn this into must-buy status. Come on, Universal - this is a NO BRAINER!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremors? More like yawns","review":"Don't get me wrong. I also loved this movie the first five times I saw it. It's a real cult classic. The small desert town of Perfection is attacked by large, underground monsters. AND THEY EAT PEOPLE. And no, it's not really a horror movie. It's more like a comic show. If you liked \\"Ghostbusters\\", \\"Evolution\\" or \\"The Blob\\", you'll gonna love this one.However, I have to admit that I've outgrown this movie. These days, I just yawn when I see it. Usually, I don't even watch the reruns. \\"Yeah, yeah, there's a monster beneath the hardware store. Whatever\\".For old times sake, however, I'll give it five stars anyway. BTW, did you know that smorgasbord is a Swedish loanword?"},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans only","review":"I wasn't pleased with the video and audio transfer. The bottom line is that this HD DVD is for fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not play","review":"in any player... all my players are fine and other dvds work. I wonder if I was sent one for the correct region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Things ARE New Under The Sun","review":"This is a truly great film. Script, casting, humor...As others have pointed out, Tremors resurrects the 50's monster movie genre, but it actually offers some new twists. I've been watching B-movies for at least 32 of my 40 years ...I've seen monsters burned, electrocuted, nuked, dissolved, chopped, diced, pureed, crushed...you name it, I've seen it. The writers of Tremors actually came up with new ways to kill the monster! I thought I'd seen it all. In addition, anytime humor is mixed successfully with horror, the result is that the viewer is kept off balance and on the edge of their seat. In my opinion, this is one of the best monster movies of the past twenty years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Movie!","review":"This was a great movie! Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon are superb as Earl and Val along with a zany cast of townspeople including Michal Gross as survivalist Burt Gummer and Reba McEntire as his wife Heather. Great special effects, the worms are terrifying!Awesome Movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"But under the ground...","review":"In homage to 1950's giant bug movies Tremors is about giant mutant worms that suck up people under the ground. The greatest thing about this film is the outlandish characters and the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously. The movie is definately more of horror movie than the sequels, but there are some very good comedy bits instead of just having a straight up comic relief character. The special effects are genuin, no CG crap, or mat paintings. The acting is funny, Michael Gross is more of an (...) in this movie than a hero like he is in the others, but I still like him better than the two leads. Worth every penny, one of my favorite movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are kidding, Right?","review":"This is possibly the worst movie I have ever had to sit through, and believe me, I have seen some really horrible movies. The acting is deplorable. The \\"special\\" effects aren't special. It was a dog. No, that is an insult to that majestic animal. My husband is an Ed Wood fan. Even those movies have a comical appeal to them, whereas this movie is nothing short of inane. If there is a God in heaven, this movie will fade into obscurity, never to be heard from again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast service","review":"The VHS tape of \\"Tremors\\" arrived in good condition and in two days from California (I live in Indiana).

Fans of this movie will love the Second movie in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Watch","review":"This movie clearly shows that the cast and the director didn't take the movie seriously. But that's okay because Tremors is fun to watch, hilarious in some scenes, and not too much blood and gore to make it just like a horror flick. All the actors played their parts very well and the plot is good enough for a movie like this. In fact, my major dissapointment is that the monsters don't look anything like the thing on the cover.All,in all, a great video to watch when trying to relax or having a party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid, but not that bad","review":"Well...the idea of the movie is...uh...well STUPID! But it is not that bad actually, It is very funny and Kevin Bacon is...oh...soo sexy. if you want to see a movie who's scary, find another one, but if you want a funny ( And a little bit creepy ) one, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true get-away-from-it-all movie","review":"I have lost count of how many times I have seen this movie. For sheer entertainment, this one cannot be topped! This movie combines a fine-though-trite story with a fine ensemble cast and blends it all together in what is arguably the best monster movie ever made. I will watch this one again and again, and can't wait to get my DVD copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"RUN FOR YOUR LIFE !!!!","review":"THIS IS A FUN AND SCARY MOVIE.IT IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE HORROR MOVIES.THIS MOVIE IS JAWS ON LAND.I HAVE HAD THIS MOVIE ON VHS,DVD AND NOW HDDVD.THE PICTURE AND MOVIE GETS EVEN BETTER WITH THE HD DVD.GO GET IT, AND GET YOUR FEET UP ON SOME SOLID GROUND."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic movie","review":"Movie was good but the delivery was poor.

(But I'm not sold on the \\"BD Live\\" thing)","review":"This is quite a humorous movie - not to be taken seriously, of course. It made an excellent addition to my movie collection.However, I would say that I don't really understand or much like the \\"BD Live\\" component (for \\"bonus content\\" it says on the back of the case): it kept telling me that it was trying to and failing to connect to the internet before it would play the movie and it bothered me. Not a big deal, but a nuisance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars if you have a sense of humor...","review":"One attribute that makes for a great movie is not expecting much of the movie in the first place, but being pleasantly surprised-- going to watch 'Conan' star in the Terminator comes to mind. Well, not much was expected of Tremors, but grudgingly on the recommendation of a friend I went ahead and watched the flick. Boy, was I surprised. This movie is all about perfect timing-- just enough comedy, but not overboard. Yes, some thriller suspense, but timed perfectly. The sight gags are incredible -- I laugh just thinking back on the pole vaulting rock hoppers, and the unappetizing pogo stick shooting back into the air. This flick deserves cult classic status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born to Be a Classic","review":"this movie was made to be a classic. it's about giant underground worms that come up from under the sand and these things that are like snacks come out and hook you and pull you in. Kevin Bacon and Fred Ward are excellent for this movie. the scenes when people get killed are really well down. the special effects are great. and the acting is good. the plot is super. on the front of the box it shows the worms having big teeth. they really don't have teeth like that. i like the part when Kevin and Fred find the guys hats full of brains and blood. it's funny when the guy gets sucked through the tire. if you haven't seen this movie go out now and rent it. you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevin Bacon","review":"Kevin Bacon is one of my favorte actors, (besides Daniel Cerny) and he is in this film trying to hunt down these tremors. there are tons of other people(you need to have others to die) and they die (some of them). I hope you all know what a tremor is. Well anyways, they try to kill the tremors in the desert and as you can tell, tremors dont have eyes and they cant see. They track you down by vibration. Also, they cannot go on rock. So see the movie :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Fun","review":"This movie is fun from the start. This movie has all the \\"cheese\\" the old 50's sci-fi horror movies had and enough comedy to make you forget the cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"The best movies are those in which you don't expect much and then it blows you away. I've read the other reviews and all those that are five star are on target. What can I add? Some of the banter, and curse words (that are not just the f word over and over) are orginal. The pseudoscientific stream involved with seismology, and sensitivity to sound is wonderfully written. All in all a classic tongue firmly in cheek movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my childhood faves!","review":"I hadn't seen this movie in over 10 years, it used to play in our basic local channels when I was a kid, and I remember really liking it, being really afraid of the worm things, remembering mr. miyagi's death and thinking \\"HOLY CRAP THEY JUST ATE MR. MIYAGI!\\" lol. So when I saw it here for a really low price, I bought it, recently watched it, and loved it just as much as I did when I was a child. Definitely entertaining enough, Kevin Bacon is REALLY young in this, and you get to see Reba kicking some worm ass. The image quality in blu-ray is really good, considering this is a movie from the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun characters","review":"This movie has an interesting plot without the nonsense of an unnecessary backstory. The characters are fun to watch because they are extreme examples of every one of us. Although many people will deny it, I think that all of us can identify with one of the stereotype characters in this movie. Although the characters are over the top, I truly like everyone in the film and found myself talking to the screen, telling the characters to run or be quiet or whatever would save them. All in all, a fun movie and quite entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"One of my favorite movies!!Unfortunately, the picture and sound quality (dolby 2.0) on this DVD are very poor (even on an upconvert player).Not worth buying!Hopefully a better product will be released in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please","review":"I can't believe they made a movie this bad, and worse yet i sat and watched it.In the 1950's this would have made my all time monster list when i was 10 years old.The best part is when they showed Finn Cater bare legs.By the why i found myself rooting for the worms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible show, complete rip-off of Dune","review":"Not one other reviewer has metioned Dune. They cannot be blamed for thier ignorance; Dune is not a well known movie. It (Dune) was made in 1984, five years before Tremors--a horrible movie, that proves Dune is not a rip-off of Tremors. The book Dune--a great sci-fi novel was written over twenty years before Tremors was produced. I think Tremors is the epitome of \\"Cool-dude\\" movies. I liked the movie; it was entertaining--that's what I thought six years ago when I was seven. I can't stress this enough, it was just a horrible movie. A C- rate cast, crapy music, no plot what so ever. If you agree with me please E-mail me."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE...\\"It Stinks Too\\".....","review":"Why anyone would give this movie 5 stars is beyond me. It stinks to high heaven....acting, story and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever!","review":"I swear this is the best movie I have ever seen! It keeps you completely staying in your seat. The whole movie is just a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"unpleasant memories of God","review":"I tried to like this book but I just couldn't get past the number of accounts Bondi gave to her horrid upbringing. I realize this wasn't her intent but just when I thought she'd celebrate her success in working through her own theological beliefs- Boom! Back she went to retell the sources for her misguided theology from youth.It is truly remarkable that she had the will to seek answers; I was just hoping she'd give more attention to the life she now leads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing reflections on a life","review":"I found this book boring and disappointingly wretched. Some of the good insights the author shared were overwhelmed by a drawn out book of what seemed like incurable self-pity. This mood unfortunately permeates the book, preventing the reader from seeing someone who is learning about herself and God through the hard knocks of life. As the book progresses, \\"inner reflection\\" turns into a continued wallowing in the quagmire of the past, leaving the reader annoyed rather than sympathetic. Furthermore, this is one of those books that needed an editor to prune it before it went to the publishers. The book is 205 pages long, but Bondi could have said everything she needed to say in 1/3 of that length. Her repetition is annoying. This book has potential that a good editor could make use of, but as it is, it isn't worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INTEGRATION OF SPIRITUALITY AND THEOLOGY","review":"Roberta Bondi has obvious roots in the wisdom of the Early Church Fathers and Mothers. Yet, her engagement of Saints through the centuries is matched only by an equally deep engagement with her life story. She speaks of ordinary times with an extraordinary vision that uncovers the sacred. Her story invites the reader to look with respect at their own journey. Some authors use profound theoretical constructs, some use personal stories: Dr Bondi is one who does both seamlessly and conveys a conviction that we can do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"Assigned to me to be read as before a spirituality seminar, I really enjoyed looking at the theological reflections of this past generation through the eyes of a theologian who is a woman. I was able to relate so much of what she said to experiences I have had with other women who have had a great influence on my own growth of thinking about God in these years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working together","review":"These games have been carefully designed so that the players \\"work together\\" to find solutions to a variety of non-violent situations. While competitive games can be good for children, it is also very important for these children to learn how to rely on each other. These games are top rated for this learning experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canadate for MST2000","review":"Now this movie was flat out bad. I mean really bad. I mean so bad non sober person would say this movie was bad. The best acted role was that of a 4 year old. That's really sad. In its favor, and this is amazing, it had wonderful costumes, and sets, and scenery designs, can't really speak highly enough about that. The movie had a couple of good action scenes, but you know only Jackie Chan can carry a bad plot and deliver good action and get by with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"see Iron Monkey instead!","review":"Plenty of people have complained about the storyline and acting. I have to agree. I've read Dumas' book, it's great, and this is not even close. Enough said.Others have praised the fighting, but really, you can see better fighting in better movies. The fights range from no-skills brawling (for example, knocking out two men with two punches to the face, or beating down two swordsmen with a tree branch) to Hong Kong-style acrobatics. But then, it wasn't even close to the acrobatics you can find in Iron Monkey (from 1993, directed by Yuen Woo-ping) in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, or in Jet Li's Fist of Legend. Those kinds of stunts fit nicely in the Asian culture but look strange in 17th century France.Are we really supposed to believe that overweight slob taught D'Artagnan how to fight like that? And in the end, Tim Roth might have won the fight if he'd spent more time fencing and less time jumping around on ladders like a circus clown. See Iron Monkey instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing result for a vision with so much potential","review":"The Musketeer, billed as a visionary new interpretation of one of the most filmed stories in movie history, falls far short of its promises.With weak screenwriting and poor dialogue, the audience will find itself silently groaning over poorly delivered, predictable lines and wondering if the director's intention was humor or high drama.Poor editing can be found throughout the film and even the most casual viewer will notice inconsistencies.The action sequences, which add some fresh intensity to the film, ocassionally leave much to be desired. Obvious time compression in action scenes can leave an audience expecting blockbuster-quality seqences disappointed.Overall, the Musketeer is indeed a new vision of a tried-and-true classic, but whether this vision is worth seeing is debatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crouching Frenchman - Hidden Plot","review":"Apparently in 17th Century France, the laws of gravity were suspended for a time. Everyone leaps around on wires to the point that it is getting silly. The swordfighting is O.K. but, it's heavly influenced by Wu Shu Kung Fu which is understandable given the stunt coreographer for the movie. The acting is wooden with half the cast speaking with a French accent and everyone else speaking Californian.Justin Chambers can't pronounce D'Artagnian, it sound like he is saying \\"Darten\\" overall, it's not that great a version of the Three Musketeers."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst things ever... and not just on DVD","review":"This movie was truly painful to watch. There is not enough space in this review to list all of the things wrong with this movie. But I will try.First of all... Some actors have British accents, others French, and the lead has an American accent. Yet others have migratory accents that wander between these three. Much of the dialogue has obviously been dubbed in after, and it sounds like it. Also, exposition is painfully squeezed into every stilted, dubbed-over line. The characters are so cartoonish and unbelievable that you will be cheering for D'Artagnan's death by the end. .....The only reason I bothered to see this movie was for the choreographed fight scenes that looked cool in the commercial. Unfortunately, they are short, poorly filmed, and badly edited. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the Musketeers","review":"It's not so much the fact that there have been far too many Musketeer films, as the fact that this movie stinks!!!The acting is totally atrocious!!! SOme of the worst acting I've seen on film. Mena Suvari was so good in American Beauty, but in this dud she couldn't act her way out of a paper bag.Whoever that guy is playing D'artanan...he looked a bit like Chris O'Donnell, who did play this character in the three musketeers, he needs to take some acting classes or find a new career. What a bore!While this fellow was nice to look at, he was such a bad actor! He needs to just stick to something easy, like male modeling.This is just another attempt at a swashbuckler film, and it failed miserably. Reminds me of some made for t.v. movie that might show up on the WB network.Watch the Musketeer film with Chris O'Donnell and Kiefer Sutherland. It's a much better made film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff and Drivel: Perfect waste of film","review":"With a \\"pert near\\" absence of plot, acting, and storyline, Musketeer falls flat on its face. What looks to be a pseudo-copy of the Disney version with Oliver Platt et al, is a hopeless effort with truly awful screenwriting, character development, and fight scenes that imploy so much cloth and whirling that it's impossible to tell who ever gets wounded. I distinctly notice within the first five minutes, however, that the film was quite dead. Please don't make me ever watch a film where most actors have a British accent, but the lead actor mumbles along with an L.A. drawl. Please don't make the mistake of renting this movie: save your money, watch the Disney version instead, which should rent for about a buck at your local video store. You'll thank me for it someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh!","review":"I'm not sure who I am more dissapointed in: the lead actor or the director. Maybe I am too used to watching actors who know how to deliver their lines, but clearly Justin Chambers does not. The utter lack of passion in his delivery gave me the impression that the director wanted him to read his lines as quickly as he could in order to get the movie over with as soon as possible. I don't blame him."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell !!!!!!!!","review":"can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes so many times in a movie I knew within the first 10 minutes of the show that it was gonna [be bad]See the acrobatic martial-artist French 17th-century swordsmen &#65533; words you had a right never to expect to see together! and the action is so badly edited and darkly lit that it's hard to tell what's happening many scenes dark and difficult to seeThis movie was one of the worst I have seen this year bad acting and the awful remake you must have watched Richard Lester's very enjoyable \\"The Three Musketeers\\" (1973) and \\"The Four Musketeers\\" (1974).

If you have a pet peeve that ruins a movie for you then it is probably in here. I feel symphathy for Tim Roth who must have took this role on a dare.I felt so blindsided when I watched this because I was not expecting the utter trash this film is.

Too bad there isn't a zero star."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this happen?","review":"If you have any respect for a story, characters or an era...DONT WATCH THIS. The names resemble the characters from a classic story written by Andre Dumas. This is about as far as the similarity goes. This is a big budget disaster. Did they try to keep it real by lighting the night scenes with candles? It provides a washed out set which might have been its redeeming feature.Dumas is turning in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever","review":"This is absolutely the worst 17th century movie I have ever seen.Words cannot describe how much it revolted me.They could do a better job if they would not try to make a film at all.If halfway through the movie, the actors began to turn into lizards, it would not have surprised me.Controlling the urge to vomit was hard to say the least.As an armourer, reenactor, historian, and having studied the sword arts for more than two decades, I can honestly say that I believe in my own heart that Micky Mouse could have played the lead role and the little pigs could have been the Three Musketeers, which by the way, we do not even get to know the Musketeers in the movie, due to the focus being on superhuman acts of levitation and flight.But if you must watch it, please bear in mind that this movie is pure fantasy when it comes to any historical value and I would not recommend it even to children if you ever want them to learn \\"real\\" storylines, from \\"real\\" books, based on \\"real\\" history."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be a rip off to see this movie for free...","review":"I saw this in the theaters with my friend, expecting to see a cross between \\"The Three Musketeers\\" and \\"The Matrix.\\" Instead, I saw this poor substitute for a movie with terrible acting, character development, storyline, and notice how on the cover the \\"critics\\" say \\"Spectacular Action Sequences.\\" They can only say good things about the fight scenes which are too short to count! Take my word on this: Don't waste two hours of your life watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worse film that I have ever seen","review":"This is the worse film that I have ever seen, the only thing that it has in common with Alexander Dumas story is the names of some of the characters, the rest is pure fiction, is a mixture of a series B chinese film Kung Fu fighters dressed as Musketeers (but only at the end of the film ) and a story created by someone that spend a night smoking or drinking God knows what and decided to make a film inspired by Alexander Dumas.No historical facts, nothing in common with the book apart from a few names , an insult to history and Dumas.This DVD ended in my dust bin.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of crap is this supposed to be?","review":"This movie sucked. The Disney version was way better. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhhh... Umm... There is little to like about this movie...","review":"But I can't bring myself to give it only one star. Probably because the fight coriographer seemed to put so mush effort into the thing... too bad most of the fight scenes were either too dark to see what was going on, or badly shot making the fight scenes a confusing mess. Anyway, I was actually going to write a much longer review of this movie, but there is no way I could do better than wild_man_dave from Austin who said just about all that needed to be said. The only thing that I want to add is that if you are a fan of the Musketeer books like I am the only way you will ever enjoy this movie (even as a cheesy action) is to make sure you see this movie as having no connection what so ever to the Musketeer books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"If there were zero stars I'd give it that. The fight scenes didn't bother me or the fact it has nothing to do with the real muskateers didn't bother me. However, it has some of the worst acting I have ever done.

There are far too few made now so it is always with excitment when one is. But in the end this adaptation just does not come through. Tim Roth is excellent as the villain. Stephen Rhea has some good moments as the Cardinal. But they never really let him shine. Porthos was a rare find in this film, he had most of the best lines.D'Artangan is too American to really work, he was a CK model after all.The action scenes were poorly done, the fencing bad and the wirework way too obvious. It just does not work well. I hope they continue to make films with flashy swordplay and all the things that make us like a good old adventure film. But sadly this one is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"it can't get any worse than this","review":"it's just awful. although the movie is allegedly based on a famous novel by dumas (the three musketeers), the movie violates both the spirit and the plot of the original story. There is no Milady, D'Artagnan's young lover does not die, D'Artagnan does not go on a mission to the UK, and so forth and so on.What makes the movie truly unwatchable is not just the fact that it has little if anything to do with Dumas's masterpiece, but is the fact that the movie is phenomenally poorly scripted and equally poorly acted.don't waste your money buying this dvd. it's not worthy. it rarely gets any worse than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least the title was right","review":"THE musteteer was about \\"A\\" musteteer. The whole story was horrible. You don't have to be a fan of the older Musteteer movies to know this was BAD. My advise is to watch the 15 second preview of the movie.

Just don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad & The Good","review":"The star of the show is Justin Chambers and he gets incidental billing which is ridiculous despite his lack of acting skills. Having a weak lead actor is not the way to have box-office success. Stupid dialog doesn't help either, along with the Rambo action mentality in which the good guy doesn't get hit from close range.On the upside, some of the action scenes were spectacular, the best swordplay I've ever seen. The ones at the beginning and the end of the film were the best, with some incredible stunt work.This movie is beautifully photographed, too. Tim Roth was a good villain, as usual, and the heroes - even if they couldn't act - were fun to watch. The language is tame in here and the film should be rated PG, not PG- 13."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I will not review this based on the book, as I was never a big fan of the book anyways, but on the film itself.Mostly, I simply found most of the characters to be bland and lifeless, with the notible exception of the villian Febre, and the plot and dialogue to be fairly weak and unexciting.The swordfighting skills displayed in the movie were dazzling, but (as another reviewer also mentioned) considering that everyone appeared almost identicle, it was a little hard to tell at times who was fighting whom. Also, while again the fight scenes were dazzling, there was no practicle reason why some of the more over the top ones were even engaged in. I am referring mostly to the fight outside the tower on ropes (why didn't someone attempt to cut D'Artagnan's rope instead of engaging him in an ariel fencing match?) and the fight on the ladders (why would Febre give up stable ground to fight D'Artagnan on unsure footing?)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why are there soooo many ladders here???","review":"While my wife and I are fans of this genre of film, we were at first appalled, and then disgusted by this poorly executed version. Some people have praised the fight sequences, but I found them lacking for the most part, and laughable in others--esp. the men on ropes on the castle's turret, and in the room full of ladders. Why were there so many ladders there anyway? Most disturbing were the inconsistencies in the plot. Why doesn't the hero make it back to the queen BEFORE the bad guys whom he beats up at the river scene? Why does he ride to Paris rather than to the ferry, where he could have saved Lord Buckingham and foiled the cardinal's plot? Why was this movie even made?? Save your money...we were disappointed even though we only rented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie I've Ever Seen In A Theatre","review":"So Bad.

I feel ashamed at being forced by Amazon.com to offer this debacle even 1 star.This film, from its very beginnings, had me saying aloud what an incredible mistake it was to waste good money on buying it.And an even greater insult was to squander the not inconsiderable talents of Tim Roth and Stephen Rea. I could only shake my head in disbelief as scene after horrid scene unfolded.It felt like some of the worst fan fiction I've ever read. And the finale with the ladders? Obviously the stunt coordinator has spent his entire life living in a box with no air holes, and nothing but Jackie Chan movies to help lighten his otherwise empty hours.Ten thumbs down, way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"All For Naught ...","review":"This ... um ... \\"adaptation\\" owes far more to the Hong Kong cinema of Jackie Chan than it does to the seminal work of Alexandre Dumas. Indeed, the credits on the DVD flap do not even credit Dumas's work as the inspiration for the script.Mastering the one-note delivery and obvious graduate of the Evelyn Wood School for Former Models Turned Actors, newcomer Justin Chambers keeps his delivery monotone while promising upstart Mena Suvari is absolutely wasted. It's hard to tell if even the action is enjoying as horrible lighting and cinematography waste nearly even frame of it.As a side interest as to how bad this film truly is, everyone in the flick has an accent of European accent EXCEPT for the two young American leads, making them appear dreadfully out of place.Honestly, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell !!!!!!!!","review":"can't remember the last time I rolled my eyes so many times in a movie I knew within the first 10 minutes of the show that it was gonna {be bad]>See the acrobatic martial-artist French 17th-century swordsmen &#65533; words you had a right never to expect to see together! and the action is so badly edited and darkly lit that it's hard to tell what's happening many scenes dark and difficult to seeThis movie was one of the worst I have seen this year bad acting and the awful remake you must have watched Richard Lester's very enjoyable \\"The Three Musketeers\\" (1973) and \\"The Four Musketeers\\" (1974).

No emotion, no feeling !What a deception !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?????","review":"Someone involved with this film should have read the book at some point. This makes either of Disney's versions valid. The best adaptation, to date, is the mid-'70's Three Musketeers/Four Musketeers directed by Richard Lester (A Hard Day's Night)and starring Michael York, Oliver Reed, Richard Chamberlain, Frank Finlay, Raquel Welch, and Charlton Heston. That version actually follows the book, for the most part, unlike this Musketeers meets Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon catastrophe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen up!","review":"I know my 4 star rating won't bring up the average, but I just have to beat down the primatives a little. No, this wasn't a great movie. But it had more action than any other Musketeer film out there. And if everyone hadn't already slamed it for being \\"Hong Kong\\".....I would just say that it was just really well corriagraphed. Sure the younger actors are, let's say, in need of experience, But their performances were sincere if a little naive. And, would everyone please stop comparing remakes to what they think are originals. The Lester films of the Seventies were remakes too, and bear more resemblance to Monty Python than to Dumas. And that's another thing....Dumas was no great writer, just a very popular pulp fiction author of his day.THE MUSKETEER stands on it's own with a very capable director showing us HIS view. To sum up....good action, witty dialog, a super villian.....a keeper.

Oh yeah, and he used a Chinese chareographer to make them jump around like ninjas.

This movie is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting, Monsieur!","review":"Born and raised in France I will tell you this movie is a supreme insult to Mr. Alexandre Dumas! The original masterpiece has been hacked to bits by a Hollywood mob hooked on fluff and with no regards whatsoever for substance; the characters are shallow, the acting without flavor and the the whole movie altogether pointless. The fighting scenes would have been enjoyable had I not been bored to tears by the senseless rubbish stuffed in between them.I give it one star for the mere reason the Amazon does not offer the possibility of a lower grade. Save your money, buy the book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spot the Squid","review":"Perhaps the most entertaining part of this movie is watching an unintentional small luminous squid skitter across the screen about 30 minutes in.The second most entertaining part is watching with disbelief as a band of guards give up chasing a coach going five miles per hour the minute it passes through a set of gates.The movie was laughable and to be honest I couldn't sit through the whole affair.The script was awful and the actors a) should have known better; b) were really desperarte; or c) thought it was a comedy and everything would work out all right in the end.This goes into my list of movies with no redeeming features, along with Spirited Killer and Modern Vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster waste of time","review":"Many reviewers have done an excellent job detailing the shortcomings of this movie. I wish I would have looked here before renting it. On the plus side, The Musketeer has some nice looking sets and some well lit scenes. On the negative side, the lead actor is awful, the script trite and humorless, the whole presentation is just bland and unengaging. I didn't even like Tim Roth, who is just too sickeningly evil and even HE can't bring the part to life. Worst of all was the action choreography and editing. The fighting was so poorly staged and cut that I had to go back 2 or 3 times just to figure out what happened. Did anybody storyboard this stuff out? Why do these filmakers think they need to cut the action so fast? You rarely get a good look at the Musketeer when he's fighting. I quit watching after the 2/3 point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make the \\"i\\" in HORRIBLE sound like a \\"e\\" and u know what i mean!!!","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever watched. The story line is weak and the acting is horrible.

This film looks stylish, but is appallingly dreadful in its cliche-ridden script and clumsy execution... To begin with, trash all hope of seeing Alexandre Dumas's grand story in a millennial revamp -- the script takes such liberties with the original material that we should consider ourselves lucky they remembered to call the hero D'Artagnan. The big deal with this film is supposed to be the Hong Kong-style \\"wire works\\" action scenes, which were choregraphed by Xin-Xin Xiong, of \\"Crouching Tiger\\" fame... Well, there is no dragon hidden in these sequences -- they are both kinetically flat and a distracting anachronism: I don't think the French palace guard ran up the side of buildings, ninja style... so why pretend they did? This movie is full of failed attempts at wackiness and bonhomie... Pity poor Stephen Rea and Tim Roth who, as the bad guys, had to attempt to carry this film all on their own.

All of those a better than this although The Musketeer has a few entaining sword battles at least and Tim Roth is good as the villain. Although Tim Roth's villain with the eye patch has been seen before and is nothing new. Michael Wincott was very good in the same role in the Disney 3 Musketeers film too. Plus the end fight between Justin Chambers and Tim Roth involving ladders is kind of entertaining but it makes you wonder why all those ladders are even there though. If they were gonna make yet another one, they could of at least offered an original story. The Iron Mask wasn't fantastic but at least it gave the Musketeers something new to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"It never gets old.","review":"I recently purchased \\"Mambo Kings\\" on DVD.

This continues to be one of my very favorite movies. The story is simple and predictable and that's okay because it's so much fun. There are some creative bits thrown in that make the familiarity of story just a bit different and the music is really phenominal-I want to get up and dance everytime I see it!The book definitely should be read, but AFTER seeing the movie-it's darker and will detract from the fun of the film. Oh, by the way, Antonio has NEVER looked better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and unimaginative","review":"Very disappointing drama (done in by a cliche-ridden script and rather uninspiring performances) of two Cuban brothers coming to America to make a name for themselves.

For example, I could imagine myself making up a meditation like this quite easily. The entire meditation lasts only 17 minutes, followed by 17 minutes of music. Mary Maddox doesn't have a lot to say--just ordinary things like, \\"breeeeth deeeeply, in and out...\\". Personally, I don't enjoy her voice, either; it's too syrupy and sing-songy for me, and it irritates me when she draws words out so much. This is my opinion and my experience. I am glad that others have had success with this; but I can't write a fake review just to get votes. It may help you make your decision if you are a hard-core insomniac.

About 5 minutes later I heard a POP and the rim of one of the martini glasses popped right off in a complete circle.

You don't need a note pad, as the language is clear and concepts explained in simple English. This a excellent book to read on the train/plane: it is interesting, job related, informative but not dull or too intellectually challenging.That said the strength of argument and excellent references are worth the cost of the book alone!

Especially sence the rape took place when Kitty was just a child and Patrick was a grown man. It really turned my stomach. I have to agree completely with one of the other reviewers who said, it is really hard to like either one of these charaters. If you are thinking of starting to read some of Virginia Henley's work please do not start with this one. All of her other books that I have read have been wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a look.","review":"Enticed is a disappointing read, less a story of romance than a catalogue of sexual perversions. Kitty jumps from one to the next, beginning with her rape at the hands of the man Henley would have us believe is the hero of the piece, through two marriages to other men that make Patrick a sideline character for a significant portion of the book. By the time she finally finds her way back to Patrick again, the book has gone on too long, and neither of the romantic leads have built up enough charisma to make the ending believable or compelling. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a weird read...","review":"\\"I'll agree with another review by saying I can't believe this author was actually published again after this one. I'm stupified of the amount of rape and attempted molesting of a fifteen year old that goes on in this book. I do realize however that teenagers were not considered children in the time period this novel took place, but the characters are cruel, indescent and flat out mean. And I really can't stand the fact that Kitty ended up with the one man who started it all. Love is never an excuse for the kind of things that went on in this novel... I finally quit reading it about halfway through and skimmed my way to the end.I'll not count this author out as of yet though, she's obviously writing something better than this because she's got pretty high ratings on goodreads and she's got a list of books a mile long, so we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most disappointing romances ever","review":"This one was my first book by VH and it has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I'll think twice before I buy other books written by her. I read the book till when Kitty marries Charles and finally, sleeps with him while she still had Patrick in her heart.I couldn't read another page after that. Throughout the book she's been saving herself for Patrick and at the end of it she gives into someone she's not even in love with. Kitty's character is a very sorry example for a heroine, especially when she's tempted to give into most men she meets at every turn, including the captain of the ship that transports her from United Kingdom to United States...Skip this book, you're not missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt enjoy very much....","review":"This is the second book of Virginia Henley's that Ive read, and I was disappointed in it after reading \\"A Year and a Day\\". It was no where near the quality of story as a Year. Don't get me wrong I did not hate the book, but I found the characters totally stupid at times, and unintelligable. Im taking my book to the used book store tomorrow to trade for something else. I guess I will have to try another one of Virginia Henley's books to see how they fare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This was my second V.H. novel and I was terribly disappointed. After reading The Pirate and The Pagan, I had high expectations. This booked lacked substance and I still can't figure out why Patrick and Kitty ended up together. It also bothered me that Kitty's character was so young in the beginning of this book. Maybe that's a typical theme in this genre of books?..but I hope not. I will definatley check other reviews of V.H. books before I commit to reading the next novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved all of the Henley books so far except this one!","review":"Of the Henley books I've read thus far, this one was by far the worst!

The reviewer that wrote \\"this book and others like it so insult the intelligence of anyone with half a brain...\\", is plainly criticizing all romance novels in general. And by his/her rude statement insults not only the author but those people that enjoys a romance novel. Was that really appropriate? I may not prefer romance novels myself, but I think that we should respect that everyone has different preference. Romance novels may not be \\"substantial\\" to some, but I think for a lot of people it offers a short enjoyable break from their everyday life and that's definitely of great \\"substance\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to volleyball and cheaply made.","review":"This dvd is a complete joke,and I believe my single purchase paid for the entire production.

I read 50 pages and found myself completely unmoved by the story and the pursuit of the killer. The writing is good: sharp, clear, fast paced. Kinky's view of the world is original with plenty of good oneliners. My main problem is the genre rather than the book - if you're into crime you will probably dig it. Most crime books are entirely plot based with not much characterisation. This is the inherent problem for me with this one. Without finding out about the characters you simply don't care if they live, die or get caught. A nice cup of tea becomes a more interesting option than trawling through another 200 pages to find the killer. I did find the killer by going straight to the end. Sam Cooke would have been proud."},{"rating":"1","title":"item not shipped, no response from seller","review":"I paid for this over a month ago and have yet to receive it.

Hunt is not my favorite actress, but she holds her own as a powerful businesswoman without falling into any of the stereotypes normally associated with such rolls. Ashley Johnson puts in a good turn as Gibson's 15 year old daughter, I look forward to seeing more of her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"The main reason to watch this movie is Mr. Gibson. He did a superb job in his role. His performance will keep you interested with what is basically a fantasy/romantic comedy. High-concept film with a clever script. The rest of the cast is solid, led by Marisa Tomei. This proves there's still a few good rom-coms out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who writes these things???","review":"DREK... absolute, pure drek. Offensive in its man-only-thinks-of-sex premise, even more offensive that Mel Gibson, like so many aging actors, is paired with ever-younger female costars. That studios still pay actors like Gibson to make such drek, and that those studios pay screenwriters to write it, and that people go see the movie in the theater and then buy the dvd, is as great a mystery to me as any."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This movie was just boring. The only funny parts were in the commercials. The movie was also so predictable, that even before I watched it I knew what was going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Women Want","review":"This movie sounded really great and original, but at most times, it just feels like you're wasting your time. You hardly get any laughs (just one), and the so little parts which are meant to make you llaugh are just way too overdone and boring. I don't really recommend this moviealthough it sounds really promising."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:E},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],H={key:0},x={key:1};function B(i,e,n,u,r,s){const m=y("PoemCard");return o(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),a(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,c)=>(o(),p(m,{key:c,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),a("span",x,"Loading...")):(o(),a("span",H,"See more"))],8,N)):v("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-fd1ea4a8"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/8.md","filePath":"drive/8.md"}'),R={name:"drive/8.md"},L=Object.assign(R,{setup(i){return(e,n)=>(o(),a("div",null,[b(W)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
