Well, TV was apparently a better medium for this story, because they could edit out his pretentiousness and direct his story to more of what actually happened, rather than a stage for him to tell the world how great he is.And even after having to drink his own piss and cutting off his arm with a pocket knife, he still hasn't learned a single lesson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gear Head","review":"\\"It's not what you do, it's who you are.\\" I know a lot of people like Aron. They live very exciting lives, but they always wind up gettting hurt. We all have choices and life is what you make of it. When you fall down, get back up. If you write a book - please focus on the important things. If you set out to prove something - prove it to yourself. Don't make the same mistakes twice and really think about what you're doing before something bad happens. And when someone says they will meet up with you later and they don't, please WORRY about them. Everyone should get out there and experience life, but if you're going to do it alone don't do anything stupid. There are lots of things to learn from Aron's story. And after all that he has done he still seems very positive about life. I think that is the most important thing about the book. Lots of fluff, but an inspiration nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling; the experience, the choices and the writing talent","review":"The moment I knew of his fate, via the news media, I had a thought; Please let this have happened so he can inspire others.My wish came true.Read this book, if you let it your life will change as a result."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This book is a \\"recommended reading\\" by a local university. I thought it might actually have some merit or be a tad interesting. This must be Aron's 15 minutes of fame book because its just couldn't hold my attention. I was amazed when his story first hit the airwaves and thought his story would be riveting. But his adventure sure is a boring read. Whoever helped him with this book must have thought his courage alone would sell the book. I could hardly finish reading this. I would tell anyone thinking of buying this book to save their money. He sounded self absorbed and I just didn't really care about the \\"filler info\\" between the accident and the end of the story where he finally freed himself and was rescued."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"just a book about a bonehead's near misses and a shameless personal celebration. i cut by most of the junk and read the portions describing his situation in the canyon. after the book was done, i have little respect for ralston and little sympathy for him losing his hand. when you relish taking dumb risks, you may get yourself in a jam. don't spend too much on this book, it's a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredible story of survival.","review":"I didn't read this book until after I saw the movie. I absolutely loved the movie, and I instantly took a liking to his story. And while the movie was great the book was even better.In his amazing book you get a much more detailed account about Arons incredible story and also the adventures he had in his life.This book will keep you up at night and keep you wondering what will happen next.even if your not a non fiction fan (such as myself) you should still read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"Aron Ralston has had an admittedly unique experience. He had to amputate his own hand to save his life. What is missing amidst all the hoopla and notoriety surrounding this amazing story is that he engineered his own predicament through a combination of stupidity and hubris. The actual circumstances leading up to and through his ordeal are interesting and, at time, riveting. However, the author takes what should be a magazine sized story , and expands it to book length by padding it with the boring and suffocatingly self indulgent \\"story of my life\\". Well, the story of Aron Ralston's life is one all too familiar in the world of \\"me first.\\" I finally had to skip long passages of \\"his love affair with himself\\" to get to the heart of the story. My suggestion: wait for the Reader's Digest version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting event, horrible book","review":"I was very interested in reading about his ordeal, but was quickly put off by the book. The writing is very forced and unnatural. He is also very self absorbed and describes himself and everything in his life as the best, biggest, hardest, most amazing thing ever. He should have had someone else write his story, and his editor proabably needs to find another job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I picked this book up because I am very fascinated by Aron Ralston's ordeal. Unfortunately, the book is a rambling mess of incoherent stories of Ralston's early adventures and only about every other chapter is about the actual ordeal that made him famous.So, not only am I totally bored and disinterested in this, it becomes obvious early on that Mr. Ralston has a history of making poor decisions and taking un-necessary risks in his travels.I still admire his fortitude in doing what he needed to to survive but he should stay away from writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of paper","review":"Aron Ralston comes off as a self centered egomaniac with a habit of making foolish decisions that lost him friends and eventually his arm. Three hundred pages of how wonderfully talented and brave Aron is followed by fifty pages that tell the story of his entrapment, rescue, treatment and rehabilitation. His mother knows; her request to Ranger Steve on the news Aron had been found \\"Please don't be judgmental\\". Page 327."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the made-for-tv movie","review":"There isn't anything of importance in this book that wasn't already covered by the news media. Lots of filler material describing past misadventures that left me with the feeling that this kid does stupid, dangerous things just to get an exciting story to tell his friends. Way too much ego caressing. I'm sure Aron will be in the news again - I just hope we don't hear of others that were with him or of those that had to rescue/recover him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and egocentric","review":"Aron's story was exciting at times and boring at other times. I think he could have left out much of his egotistical, self-centered, \\"I'm a great mountaineer and outdoorsman\\" fluff. I found myself skimming over his past expeditions in an effort to get to the meat of the story, the story about his survival in that slot canyon. Although it was not one of my favorite non-fiction books, it ranks pretty close to the top for the sheer fact that I still cannot stop thinking about his ordeal and how he finally came to that decision to amputate his own hand. I didn't want to read it but I couldn't stop myself from reading it. It really made me think about what I would do in the same situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Book","review":"Great Book for people who love the outdoors.

I was happy to see his admission of being a control freak and complaining about his after care in there tho....he IS human.....I actually thought a lot more of him BEFORE i read this book than I did after......glad this was from the library for sure.

I could not put it down. Need I say more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"As someone else said, I was very impressed that Aron wrote this himself. It is very descriptive and lends thoughtful insight to his thought processes and his experiences leading up to this. He does come off as rather cocky, which is kind of off putting, but he does seem to have the skills to back it up. I had wondered if his previous near death experiences and this one especially has made him a little more cautious or if he simply feels more invincible. I'm sure he is more appreciative of life and his friends and family, but I'm not sure that he should curtail these dangerous activities as some people are saying. I love how he is living life to the fullest, and quit a very good job at Intel to pursue what he really loves and is good at. I think this is something we can all take home from this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Book","review":"I found this book inspiring. His will to live drove him to make decisions that most of us cannot even imagine. It will drive readers to value their lives even more.I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because, as it is well written, it is a bit drawn out. I kept wanting to skip ahead.Overall - Very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Strametto or rather James Allen seems to have a gripe against Moonshine must be a frustrated unreleased DJ I guess.

You may like all the ones I don't. The three or four I do like are fantastic.What really cracks me up about this CD is the final song. About 30 or 45 seconds into the intro, the song has the sound of a quarter dropping onto the floor. In my car, it absolutely sounds like someone just dropped change in the passenger area. That's ridiculous of course, because cars have carpet, but it still gave me a few starts until I got used to it. Once, I played it for a buddy to see what he would do, and on hearing the noise he jerked and started looking around for the offending quarter. Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORD","review":"Fo' shizzle. This album is just straight dope. A great listen the whole way through, and the perfect CD for that brand spankin' new sound system in your car. Loud, heavy beats mixed with some of the most soulful female vocals I've heard in a long time help to make this CD a must have for fans of the electronica genre. If you're into the Crystal Method or BT, you will dig this. I just bought the CD today and I haven't been able to take it out of the stereo. This is my first introduction to the music of Cirrus, and they definitely do not disappoint. Pick it up if you want some great, driving, up-tempo beats to pick you up.

For the money charged here, the encyclopedia should visit major topics in the world's scriptures such as the state of human existence, salvation, or the character of the supreme and provide a summary annotated to each tradition's scripture.

Research two things regarding this. \\"The Myth of the Lost Cause of the Confederacy\\" and the writings and actions of Jefferson Davis and General Jubal Early in the years following the Civil War. You will find an organized, systematic propaganda campaign that covered reasons for the war and justifications for succession and for the barbaric para-military campaigns carried out by Nathan Bedford Forest and others under the banner of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan against Afirican-Americans.

With virtually no attribution, he stresses that slaveowners were a paternal lot, that slaves had better living conditions that most whites, and that large mulatto populations in 1860 do not indicate owners and overseers \\"had their way with slaves.\\" I bought this book by mistake, thinking it was serious history.

It's quite true that both _Voyaging_ and _Power of Place_ are books you can't put down; they are so absorbing that you instantly forget you are reading. I find myself recommending them to people with no interest whatsoever in the subject simply for the reading pleasure. For scholars of the historical subject, the volumes provide a unified and inspiring reference.

Providing crisp action and dialog, wry observations and a deft hand with humor, Steven Forrest delivers the goods in this mystery featuring astrologer Plato Mims and a friend who is framed for the murder of his own father.

Instead of seperate pieces, one gets the feel of a whole. And this makes all the difference.The Wiener Solisten play wonderfully.

This book is a must for all women seeking true answers to their health options as well as options for their children. It is enlightening and informative, and it does not discount traditional medicine all together.

Each oversize page contains three to eight reproductions of various types of print projects as well as online examples. Illustrations are large enough to teach meaningful lessons.Samples are grouped by category. Printing and production values are high. The tinest details clearly emerge.Thumbing through the book, one of my first impressions is the power that comes from the simplicity of the designs and the designer's use of color.This book would make a great \\"sample book\\" for internal training of a design studios' staff, as well as a framework for a semester-long commercial graphic design course or workshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice workout","review":"I like this 25-minute video. It doesn't give you very much of an aerobic workout, but it does strengthen legs, abs, arms and shoulders. The pace isn't too fast (not too slow either), and there is a small but friendly-looking class doing the exercises with Jodi. You use weights, so as you gain strength, you can up your weights to keep it challenging. The 25 minutes goes very fast.

The end-of-chapter problems and excercises thus become just plug-and-chug, and they teach the student absolutely nothing about semiconductor devices.

I have my PS3 hooked up via HDMI at 1080i and I love it.Pros: price; great tv for a smaller room. Picture quality is extremely sharp. Sound is very good for small tv speakers (audio out is also included on this tv) Lots of inputs including 2 HDMI and 1 PC Input. Internal HD Tuner is a plus. I received about 5 digital channels over my basic cable.Cons:So far I have not been able to get the Picture in Picture to work. Havent played much with it yet so it could just be my error. I know the PIP will not work with cable/cable but to my understanding it should work with cable/other input.Overall I would definately reccomend this tv for someone that is looking at their first HDTV or someone who is looking for another HD set for their home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV, Great Price","review":"Have been very satisfied with the purchase of this Samsung TV thus far. Set-up was easy, picture is wonderful, sound fantastic.

Thompson of radio -- he turned the whole thing upside-down, putting himself at the center of the action. He is fearless and profane. He is challenging, fearless, unpredictable and dangerous. His first book chronicled his early years and rise to fame, but this second memoir focuses on his current adventures. It's another great read though. His political and multimedia agenda give him an even heavier Hunter Thompson vibe, which is just where Stern should be taking his irreverent and volatile comedy. Stern is a forward thinker, seizing upon the new satellite radio format with a vengeance. It's already paid off for Stern, and will continue to do so as the medium moves more and more away from traditional broadcast technologies. What Stern does with that increased power, one can only guess, watch and wait.Fifty Shades of Trailer Park Boys: TPB in the Great Comedic Traditions"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"This book was funny, but not as funny as Stern's previous work.

Similar to the comments listeners make about the radio show, I kept reading to see what would come next. I was really disappointed. Things that may be funny on the radio just seem trite when written.

Not only does the book lack the structure that \\"Parts\\" had, but it's just not funny. Also one can see through Stern's attacks on Rush Limbaugh and realize that it's Stern's jealousy over never being able to reach the success or respectablility of Limbaugh.

And just run on sentences going nowhere. He must sell them to his followers, becasue there is nothing of interest in it just talking and talking and talking of the FCC, and how he did this and that, where ever he ends up, he does.

It is clear that Ray is playing up his new \\"Storyteller\\" image that he created with the first installment of the VH-1 series and his solo CD. But his storytelling is best suited to his songwriting and one-man show. The stories in this book are disjointed and make no sense. Ray may be trying too hard to be some kind of existentialist poet and pays too little attention to plot. For the benefit of Kinks fans, he throws in the lyrics to Kinks songs that have little to do with the stories except for their titles. The stories are a lot like his film \\"Return to Waterloo\\", which had little plot but benefitted from the great music.

The human single player episode took me about 3 hours to solve. The Predator version took about 2.5 hours. The Predalien version took 4 hours, mostly because some of the room exits were very subtly placed and difficult to find. So for me, this expansion was around 9.5 hours total game time.

My teacher was great, so I have an A or A- in the class (grades aren't in yet), but it was no thanks at all to this textbook. Whenever I got stuck on a problem, I would try to go back to the chapter for some guidence, but, well, there isn't any. I am very good at math, and I had a hard time following what they were doing in the examples. There were more than a couple of problem formats at the end of the chapter that weren't really explained at all in the text. I guess if your teacher only uses the book for the end of chapter exercises, it is good, but we still had to go over a lot of them in class because, like I said, the book didn't explain how to do some of them and we were all lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Book","review":"This book is pretty solid. I am learing Calculus for the first time and have been very pleased with the format and descriptions. I like that there are bios of people who have contributed to the foundation of Calculus as well.

I have been reading many Access Books, and Access VBA Books, and have yet to find one that really teaches you how to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It's Weight","review":"For being nearly 1300 pages, this book is barely sufficient. While there is plenty of information, the book is poorly organized with sparse and general headings followed by paragraphs of wordy explanatory text. A better use of headings and sub headings would allow for better reference.Turning for help in the index is also disappointing. The book is poorly indexed and seems to have been given little thought or personal attention to its organization.The last place to turn is to code samples, but these are so sparse and abbreviated that you have to search for them among pages of text. I'm all for having copies of the code on the accompanying CD, but for even a neophyte, sample code is essential to grasping all the detail.I feel sympathetic that the author obviously spent a prodigious amount of time writing 1300 pages of prose, but the bottom line for technology books is that you need to show me, not just tell me about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sequel of Step by Step","review":"This book is the perfect sequel to Microsoft's \\"Microsoft Office Access 2003 Step by Step\\".

It's almost impossible to read the book without referencing to the example database. It is badly written, too generic and it offers no answers to practical questions. It's a book for beginners, but the title pretends otherwise. Here is just a random sentence from the book that illustrates how bad it is (and there are MANY of these)...

For those of you who want to check it out for yourselves, good luck.

It has great silly costumes.And it really is about the absurdity that you find inside an MMORPG. The one girl just spends her time dancing. There is ninja-looting, hardcore soloing, PvP, and sand whales.I feels like this movie was filmed in English, but it also feels like only one of the four speaking characters can actually speak English. The talking can be quite painful.I originally described this movie as an empathetic DO NOT WATCH. But I've softened my stance since then.

When researching this film, I saw several conflicting reviews of the films length. It turned out to be only 1:10 (70 minutes). The first 5-10 minutes comprise a lengthy monologue setting the stage. The speaker seemed to mumble, so it was difficult to hear or make any sense of the opening monologue. Then, we meet the four characters in a very superficial way, with the female lead, Meisa Kuroki \\"Gray\\" most developed. The film moves excruciatingly slowly. In the end, there were precious few moments of any action. The director's style might of worked in a much longer production. As it turned out, the film was cut short before it even got going. Most unfortunate, as the concept for the film was most interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This movie is a terribly boring art house film.

So what if this movie is slow (fast forward!), makes you wonder where this is all leading to (get to the point already!) and the rare amounts of dialogue, well the less said about the script the better... but it does feature hot girls, awesome action in the few exciting parts it does have and the ending is pretty epic.

This CD has the music alone, which is a unique listening experience not offered by the other soundtrack containing the dialog with music playing in the background. The recording sounds great with today's technology recreating the original score, which was composed back in the 1960's. If you already own the movie on DVD you may prefer this to having a collection of audio tracks from the film. However, I wonder what the old 1968 recordings would have sounded like if they would have been released without the dialog from the film. That would really have been marvelous to listen to-- even with the old fashioned techniques used at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Praque Philharmonic Orch","review":"I have purchased a many album with the above mentioned orchestra playing.

I discovered In Flames when the heavy music scene looked as though it could sink no further, and it was a shocking and blissful experience when I first heard the band. I dutifully purchased their entire catalog and discovered the brilliant Whoracle, The Jester Race, Colony, and Clayman. But I was disappointd when Reroute came out because I though it lacked the elements that made In Flames stand out the most. The guitar was much less interesting, and the vocals were often irritating in an effort to create vocal melody. Unfortunately, the band pursued all the wrong things from Reroute in recording the new album. It truly is a different band, and the change is unfortunate. I don't want to have to rely on the other Swedish metal gods to provide great music. I want In Flames back. And I'm not the only one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss death metal","review":"In flames definently is going down the crapper,this is the only gothenburg band to jump on the bandwagon of stupid hardcore vocals(the kind where they dont know how to scream).It really gets me mad,that all of the other bands from Gothenburg get better each albulm but In flames gets softer and worse every single albulm,pull it together Fredman =("},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"I love In Flames.

Please In Flames, trade in your leather pants with 500 zippers on them and Spineshank T shirts for a good ol' nostalgic trip through wastelands for eternity......you guys could even do yet another version of Behind Space and I'm sure it would make your fans happier than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best but... (3.5 stars)","review":"Damn people, give this album a little credit. I mean they are still In Flames. On their worst day they are better than 90% of heavy acts out there.Comparing them to American Nu-metal acts? This is just foolish. In Flames is way ahead of any \\"nu-metal\\" band out there as far as technicality, heaviness, creativity, ect, ect.I don't think \\"nu-metal\\" even exists anymore (I never cared for that idiotic categorization anyway). People should quit using the term. Korn is dead and buried. Slipknot altered their sound. No one cares about all those those moronic Roadrunner bands anymore. System of a Down is way to original and important to be called nu-metal.If anything, maybe the new In Flames style fits in better with the new american metal movement. Here I'm talking about bands like Killswitch Engage, Unearth, Shadows Fall, God Forbid, Lamb of God.

They are capable of so much more than this. In Flames is my all time favorite band, they're what got me into the whole death/black metal scene years ago. When I first heard albums like Whoracle and Colony they sent chills down my spine, truly masterpieces. Although this album is much better than Reroute To Remain it is still a long way from their old works. STYE adopted much a more darker atmosphere then the unusually upbeat tracks on Reroute. For those of you looking to check out In Flames I suggest picking up their older albums first so you know what they are truly capable of (Lunar Strain, Black Ash Inheritance, Jester Race, Whoracle, Colony, Clayman) but don't hesistate to pick up STYE or Reroute...

If you get this expecting the greatness that their older cds have, then yes you will be somewhat dissappointed. But from there you have two options. Will you accept this as a good cd on its own and enjoy it for what it is? Or will you dislike it and hate In Flames for what they have recently being doing with their change in musical style? I personally chose to enjoy the new material but if this cd came out from some other band I would probably have thought more highly of it. Anyway the choice is yours on whether or not you will like this cd.

Fortunatly they've laid those doubts to rest by realeasing another quality album. This is pretty much the same style seen on Reroute, its just been perfected. The reason this dosen't get 5 stars though is because it just isn't as good as their old material, cause even if it's a damn good nu-metal/melodic death album it's still part nu-metal. Fans into old In Flames, Dark Tranquility and Opeth should check out Insomnium or Arsis, who are bringing the traditional melodic death sound back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened to In Flames??!!","review":"When this album came out, I was expecting something good. \\"Reroute to Remain\\" was actually a dissapointment.

They were the perfect \\"melodic\\" alternative to Death Metal.You will find a lot of 4 and 5 stars reviews of this album saying that is \\"awesome!!!\\" but make no mistake. It is not. If you are a fan of Korn, you will love this but for those of us that like In Flames until \\"The Clayman\\", this is horrible. I gave it 2 stars because it has good vocals and some moments here and there. I recommend their others releases until \\"The Claiman\\" instead.

Yeah its different but its still a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack to Mediocrity","review":"I'll give In Flames credit for being able to run with their formula from \\"Reroute to Remain\\" which has apparently made them a bit of an MTV darling (Yeah, saw the video for Cloud Connected from RTR on MTV). As anyone knows, In Flames started off as a pretty original (Melodic) Death Metal band, known as Gothenburg Metal. Since those days, many bands have popped up, and none are particularly original. In fact, finding an original Death Metal band these days is quite a task. With this CD, In Flames jumps into the stream of unoriginality. This is by no means a \\"bad\\" album, but nor is it a good one. I wouldn't call it Nu Metal, but it's by no means anything special. Only hardcore fans of RTR and Nu Metal fans will enjoy this release. For me, I need something with a little more innovation, and a little less formula. A much better band of the \\"Gothenburg\\" style which you should check out instead is Insomnium."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Flames only good album (so far)","review":"From Lunar strain- Reroute to remain, In Flames was a typical cliche melodic death mteal band.

The sounds are very thick. It is however quite a departure from previously released material. There arent as many really fast tunes. Most of them seem to me to be medium to uptempo rockers(there are a couple fast tunes). No all out assaults on the senses. I do love the production and the new experimentation with tone. As a musician myself I like to hear my favorite bands trying new stuff doing stuff that isnt what theyre known for, stagnation is not a good thing.Over all Id give this album a 4. Only because My favorite In Flames album is Lunar Strain and those tunes were just shred- fests. Sndtrk to Your Escape is chocked full of really cool riffage.

The first time I heard it I wanted to shoot it with a M16 because I thought it sucked so bad. But it grows on you. It really does. I have been listening to it for the last 2 hours straight absorbing every bit of it in. Give it a try, and don't flame it because its not the Clayman In Flames or its not the In Flames you thought it would be.

One thing, this album shows alot of musical talent for In Flames. Yeah I'll agree that Colony and Clayman are their best albums, but this is not a horrible cd. In fact, it's very far from that. With songs like My Sweet Shadow and Dial 595-Escape. This just has to be a great album. But, I guess if all you like is nothing but muddy toneless guitars and screaming noises. Then you wont like this album as much as their previous. This is one of my favorite cds, but then again every In Flames cd is my fav.

They went from sounding like a distorted version of Slipknot to sounding like a Lamb of God clone. In fact if this was not In Flames I probably would have given this 3 stars, maybe even 4 if I was in a good mood.

From that point I went back in their catalogue and found out they had so much more to offer.

The Jody Grind was all about Kelly Hogan - a singer who deserves much more recognition than she has received to date. While Hogan's later work has been mostly rooted in alt-country, the Jody Grind was eclectic to the extreme - jazz, R&B, rock, and soul all mixed together. To put it simply, if you are a fan of great female vocalists, you need to seek this CD out. While Hogan is best appreciated in person, this will give you a taste. After you've digested \\"One Man's Trash\\" be sure to follow up with her solo recordings. Everything she does is worth hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reunited","review":"I had One Man's Trash is Another Man's Treasure when it first came out.

The incredible version of Peter Gunn alone is worth seeking this record out.Some random bit's of trivia and history:The band took their name from a Horace Silver song/album title.The band put out one more album before a tragic car accident killed one of the members and Atlanta performance artists Deacon Lunchbox.Kelly Hogan continues to sing with friends like the Mekons and Andrew Bird.

And while the solid reporting continues in this effort, there's something missing. Many political junkies rank 1992 as the oddest election in memory, stranger even than the de facto tie of the 2000 race. Why? Two reasons: the inexplicable buoyancy of Bill Clinton, and the Perot phenomenon -- that brief springtime period when a businessman on a third party ticket shot to 40 percent in the polls while the Democratic nominee fell to third place (less than 25 percent!) and then recovered to win the election -- and oust an incumbent Republican who had polled a 91 percent approval rating less than two years earlier.

I'm not sure how good this book would be for someone without previous courses in Spanish, but it worked well for me. The explanatory sections are short and clear, and are followed by exercises pertaining to the lessons. The book builds upon previous chapters.

If you know nothing of AA this may serve as a nice little sampler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paul's Letter to the Romans","review":"As usual, Ben Witherington III provides lots of helpful background information on the Roman world. His clear style makes this commentary very accessible but he also includes plenty of solid scholarship. He leans toward the conservative/evangelical end of the spectrum, but does engage some of the difficult textual issues, sometimes coming to fresh and interesting conclusions. I would recommend this commentary to seminarians, pastors, or believers who want to dig a little deeper into Paul's \\"difficult to understand\\" letters.The main downside to this commentary is that Witherington has sacrificed a user friendly format in favor of academic integrity in that he does not use verse numbers. This makes it ponderous to match his comments to the specific text he is referring to. He also frequently references technical rhetorical vocabulary, so someone not familiar with peroratio, rationatio, etc, should probably invest in another resource that will explain those terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"After \\"Where the Heart Is\\" I expected so much more. Don't get me wrong; the storyline is fine and all, but the characters weren't up to the task of carrying it. Bui Khan, what in the world happened to him at the end of the novel? You never find out. It's not like one of those sentimental well-ending novels where this device works. And Vena Takes Horse was so complex that she was unclear. And the sideplot about her sister was never fleshed out. Like another 2-star reviewer said, if only Letts didn't feel pressured with the Oprah thing for her first novel, this book could've really been something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I read this book because I enjoyed Where the Heart Is so much. This book isn't quite as good as that one, but an enjoyable read just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of the family of the \\"Honk\\" characters.","review":"The characters were wonderful, and what a mix of personalities that all blended as a family. It was just so pleasant to read -- so heartwarming. I didn't want it to end. I read an average of 3 books a week, and of all that I have read this year to date, I enjoyed this the most. I probably liked it at least as well as \\"Where the Heart Is\\" but I think I will remember this family of characters longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I embraced these characters!","review":"It took me less than 12 hours to read this book. I could not put it down. I was first drawn to it by the author, since I am a fan of both the book and movie, Where The Heart Is. Plus, as a displaced Sooner, reading books that take place in Oklahoma is a passion of mine. I was truly drawn into the story from the first chapter, and it only got better with the turn of each page and the further delving into the character studies. Billie Letts has a way of drawing you into the lives of these folks...so much so, that I wanted to live in the town and share the lives of these characters. What more can you ask from a good story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Characters","review":"Even if you don't understand American culture very well, you can feel slightly the human feeling the characters have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"I didn't expect to like this book as much as Where the Heart Is. Well, I liked it even more. Letts' characters were unique and had they interesting secret pasts. What I enjoy most about this book and Where the Heart Is is how Letts brings diverse characters together in odd settings and creates a family with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Honkin' Triumph!","review":"Billie Letts definitely leads the pack in contemporary writing geared for entertainment.

THE HONK AND HOLLER OPENING SOON is a story to open your heart. The characters share their lives and loves with some heartbreak along the way. You'll find yourself cheering for them. This is one of Letts' best efforts. Read it and HONK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brandon's Review of Honk and Holler Opening Soon","review":"The Honk and Holler Opening Soon is a very good book that I found very intertaining. I really didn't think that I would like the book at all, I only choose it because it seemed the most enteresting off a list I had to read, but about half way through I started to enjoy reading it. All the characters are done very well and show lots of depth even though they are used in a very one sided manner. Caney, the owner of the Honk, is a ver deep and likable character who I thought I would really hate due to most handicap characters in books just being their to generate sympathy. Bui, the short order cook, is the character I found most likeable in the whole book. Bui really is the character that shows the depth that Billie Letts can put in her characters. In closing, I highly recommend this book to anyone that is looking for something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"A LAUGH OUT LOUD QUICK AND EASY READ","review":"Bille Letts takes ordinary characters and make them extraordinary. You can't help but fall in love with her quirky characters. Ms. Letts takes everyday heartache and shows us that we can find humor in life's ups and downs. I actually laughed out loud reading both her books. She is a talented writer and I hope she gives us more books soon because both her books are quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as great as the first book, but more enjoyable!","review":"I really enjoyed \\"The Honk and Holler\\". I was pleasently surprised to find that I like this book better than \\"Where the Heart Is.\\" The characters were very likeable and you really fell into their lives in their small town. You can identify with at least one character and match the others up with people in your town. This book is not intensely thought provoking nor too serious and drawn out. It wasn't intended to be a book that leaves you questioning the story and feeling depressed. So,if you are looking for a relaxing, easy going, and very entertaining book, this is it!! I love Billie Letts' style and look forward to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable","review":"I am looking forward to billie letts' next book. I enjoyed \\"the honk\\" as much as \\"where the heart is.\\" Her writing style is enjoyable, and her characters are endearing and so real."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Nutritious As Chewing Gum","review":"The Honk and Holler is a tired truck stop, run by a tired owner, and patronized by tired regulars. The place is spiced up when vagabond Vena Takes Horse appears (followed shortly by another refugee, Bui Khanh), but the story needs more than a dash of seasoning.The flyleaf reads, \\"the characters who drift in and out of the Honk...\\" That aptly describes the characters: they drift in and out. It makes for a jumble of a story and leaves the reader constantly wondering how their circumstances tie together. Other than the restaurant, there seemed to be no common thread. It's hard to avoid comparison of the solid, passionate characters of WHERE THE HEART IS with the stick figures of THE HONK AND HOLLER. If only Ms. Letts hadn't been rushed to follow up the Oprah success; perhaps she would have been able to add meat to their bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"I'm an italian english student. This is my first book in English. I enjoyed this book because it is very easy to read! I'm going to read other books written by Billie Letts. I loved her characters because they are far to be perfect. Caney the owner of the cafe in which the novel takes place is a Vietnam vet. He is a desabled man after an acciden during the war. Caney lives with a sense of failure. He works with Molly O, who is like a mother for him. The cafe does not get good business untill Vena, the new carhop, comes to town. Caney, hires in his cafe also Bui, a Vietnamise in search of a life. This is a book full of human feelings in which \\"amor vicit omnia\\" (love win everything) and in which everythig can happen (an american vet become friend of a Vietnamise guy). I strongly recommend this book and I'm also sure that \\"Honk and Holler\\" could be a good movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I wont get into the story line because that has been covered so much already.

I read the bare minimum of what is assigned in school, and sometimes not even that. I enjoyed reading this book so much though. I honestly couldn't put it down. I felt like i knew ever character and loved hearing all about them. It is an amazing story about normal people that aren'e perfect, but have created amazing lives for themselves. After reading this book i had all my friends read it, and i didn't have one that didn't like it. I reccomend it to everyone. Especially all you teenagers who need to find a book to read for school. This is it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Honk and Holler Opening Soon","review":"I read The Honk and Holler Opening Soon for a project in my English class. At first, I only read the book because it sounded the least boring out of all the books to choose from for the project. Then, when I started reading it, I realized that it is a really good book, and I finished it in 2 days. I really like Boo and Caney; they are my two favorite characters. The setting is perfect for the story, also. The characters all seem so real. I had a dream about them the night I finished the book. All in all, I think that if you're looking for a book to read, then you should definately read The Honk and Holler Opening Soon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billie Letts is now one of my favorites!","review":"I was given this book by a coworker to read, because she loved it. It took awhile for me to get into it...I wasn't too fond of Caney at first, because he was so negative, but after I really started reading, I began to like him a lot. The relationships that Caney has with all the different people in his life really made me think about all the people I deal with on a day to day basis and how I sometimes take them for granted. I liked that he was always there for Vena and for Molly. Molly's relationship with her daughter was amazing, I wish it would have ended up on a better note. I was really glad that he went after Vena and brought her back home with him, that is what she needed. I can't wait to see the movie, if that is what Billie Letts plans on doing with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"More characters who capture the heart and inspire faith.","review":"If you do not mind vivid characters who could have easily been alive in Letts' Where the Heart Is, The Honk and Holler was written for you. As a former teacher of students from Viet Nam, I am please with Letts' ability to who reveal the prevailing good character of and prejudice against this group of immigrants. Those who have turned friends into family will appreciate the team at The Honk. Like Where the Heart Is, this book doesn't stop until characters determined to survive do far much better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio cassette book","review":"I love this story . I read the book plus later ordered the audio edition The merchandise arrived in a reasonable amount of time but Only the first 3 cassettes played clearly the rest were barely audible"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a lot like a movie called \\"The Bagdad Cafe\\"","review":"I read this book a long time ago, and thought it sounded like a movie from the early '80s I saw called The Bagdad Cafe, filmed near Barstow, CA. Same premise, run down cafe/gas station motel, run by a woman with a disfuncional family, daughter run amuck, slacker boyfriend, teen age boy with baby, strange character who lives in a trailer out front who lives in the past, etc. Strange German woman shows up out of now where and changes everybody's lives. I think she must have seen this movie first, then changed things up a bit. This book would have made a good movie too. Anyway, rent or see Bagdad Cafe on Netflix streaming if you like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Although I have not read this entire book (as it was an Xmas present for my sister) -- I did thumb through the chapters briefly before I mailed it up to her. From my estimation, it appears to be a very charming story. Thanks, Linda"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite","review":"A long and drawn out story with very underdeveloped characters. This was a lengthy tale of a diner and the people who ate there. I kept hoping and waiting it was going to get better. I expected so much more after Where the Heart Is. I am in awe of how well everyone reviewed it. I thought it lacked the savvy of the first novel and I thought the character names and histories sounded a little too familiar. Reading this book made me feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"I was expecting a better book than this having read \\"Where the heart is\\". The characters were so underdeveloped and then details were thrown in about characters that were barely mentioned during the course of the book. This book was a big let down. It was one of those books that you read half way through and just want to stop because it is so unfullfilling. I cannot believe the good ratings this book has received from most people."},{"rating":"2","title":"this was good","review":"i really this book whoops because it focused on wonderful characters and has a very creative title that fits the book well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great follow-up","review":"What a truly engaging novel. I loved Ms. Letts's characters in Honk and Holler just as much as I did in Where the Heart Is. Somehow she makes you really care about them, which is a hard thing to do in my opinion! A word of warning to some who hope that this novel is a Where the Heart Is knock-off: it's not, far from it. You cannot compare the two, if you do you will be disappointed. Honk and Holler is a completely different novel that stands tall all by itself. Please read this one, it's fantastic. Can't wait for book number 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read it straight through in about 4 hours!","review":"Once I started it I couldn't put it down....it was very easy reading. I have read Places in the Heart and find her writing endearing. You really get involved in the different characters and I was truly concerned about what happened to them! What an eclectic group of characters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting characters - a good comfortable read","review":"The characters and the story line were interesting even if a tad bit predictable. The characters were solidly written and the author did a wonderful job in assigning their personality traits. I must say I was a little disappointed in the ending - I felt there were a few too many loose ends for my taste - it almost felt like the author tired of writing - but perhaps that is simply her style. Even with that, the story-line is solid and the characters fun to get to know. A good quick Saturday read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Honk and Holler Opening Soon-GREAT book","review":"This is a really good book. I could not put it down. I have read it 3 times.

I LOVE this book!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A WONDERFUL STORY!","review":"Like another amazon.com reviewer, I put off reading this book because I loved WHERE THE HEART IS so much. I didn't want to be disappointed. A clerk in a mall bookstore told me that this book was even better so I took a chance. It was WONDERFUL! I didn't want it to end. Although I loved WHERE THE HEART IS, I liked this book better. The story in this book was more plausible and realistic than WTHI (which even though I loved it,was a little unbelievable at times). Billie Letts is a masterful storyteller and I EAGERLY anticipate her next book. I won't wait to read it. I will be one of the first in line."},{"rating":"2","title":"HAD HIGH HOPES AFTER WHERE THE HEART IS","review":"THE BOOK WAS A FUN READ VERY FAST PACED BUT I NEVER FELT THAT I GOT TO KNOW ANY OF THE CHARACTERS.

I'm usually disappointed with the 2nd book, feeling they never match up to the first one-- but this one truly did. I really enjoyed the characters in this book-- they are in many ways typical of all of us, in search of a place to belong. But also distinct by their own rights. I found myself thinking about them between times in reading and was always anxious to pick up where I left off and find what had happened next. A highly satisfactory read-- I strongly recommend it. The author had no reason to doubt herselt, as she talks about in the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Around Great Story","review":"Such an easy book to get interested in and read! A comical group of characters with a lot of substance and serious under-tones. Billie Letts is such a terrific author. The story of a true \\"diner\\", not the \\"chain restaraunts\\" of today. The American \\"melting pot\\" of employees and patrons. Just a cute story with some strong messages. Definitely read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book.","review":"I could hardly wait to read this book & was sorry when it ended. It's warm, funny but yet a story where the characters seem to become real & take a life of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Billie Letts ride","review":"It's another great all-American story, people from all over the world struggling to understand one another and make their own way, colliding in strange and random events that form a complex and rich whole. Letts is a perennial optimist about the goodness in people's hearts, the richness and wholesomeness of middle-America, and the fulfillment you get from friendship. Her books are peppered with the harsh realities of poverty, abuse and neglect, but she re-works them into stories of triumph and hope that make for a great read, and a real emotional boost. It's a feel-good book that doesn't shy away from the tragedies of life, but shows how love, friendship, family and community can overturn evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"all you wanna be punk rockers, stop putting down this album","review":"ive been a long time fan of saves the day, the get up kids, etc...i found this band while looking up a further seems for ever album and then i saw it in record and tape traders and decided it was worth a try. i listened to it and wasnt too impressed at first, thought it was good but nothing too special. then i listen to the album for the rest of the day, and by the end the day, i was practicly in love with this album. its great. it grows on you.i love this album. some of those irritating punk-rock kids are used to screaming and shi t and cant understnd the genius of this band. some say it boring. its not boring! its emo!!

I like some mellow music, and I'm not opposed to more experimental songs (I just finished listening to Galaxie 500 and Zoviet France), so it's not like this is going over my head or anything.

But that enjoyment soured very quickly and I ended up selling the CD. What we have here is paint-by-numbers emo, similar to 764-HERO's fatal misstep, \\"Get Here And Stay\\". Sure, the performances are pleasant, the songs are unobtrusive but also very predictable with a short shelf life. But isn't that what NW rock is about? Yes, they have more than a little in common with Built To Spill. Yes, you can spot their influences a mile away. The production is the tinniest and shallowest I have heard in a while. Everything about this release seems designed to appeal to the indie-emo kids.

Despite what others say, I don't think they sound all that much like Built to Spill, or Modest Mouse. The more you listen to this record the more you like it. They are really good live and this album is still on my current playlist.

Certainly not for everyone. I mean, it's not especially catchy, modern or even warm. But with repeated listens, \\"Airplanes,\\" with all its lo-fi indie-ness grows on you. And it is quite good. Like everyone says, they come from the great Northwest sounding like Built to Spill, 764-Hero and American Football. Some of the lyrics just stick to your head. \\"Ohh, what a way to cut lengthwise.\\" The songs are sparse - you can taste the air between his words. DCFC relies on subtle touches, like a cello, different effects and simple riffs, to manage a collection of oddly reflective tunes. Not a chore, once you discover that it's a prize... A must have for all DCFC fans! If you are new to DCFC, check out \\"We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes\\" or even \\"The Photo Album.\\" An indie music accomplishment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective","review":"I think the disparity in reviews (jumping from a more accurate 4 or 5 to a ridiculous 1) indicate that this CD is not for the average human being. If you expect a CD full of radio-friendly fist-pumping arena rock, your are in for a disappointment. Then again, you are too slight of mind to appreciate Death Cab anyway. The nuances of a slower song (which is a good portion of this album) might take longer to appreciate, but by no means does that make them 'boring'. Do people complain that Elliott Smith doesn't rock out?...that would be ignorant. The melodies on this disc are exquisite - notice i didnt say on this song or this song...This whole disc is impeccable...but do yourself a favor. If you enjoy bopping your head to the latest radio single from matchbox 20 or some other such inane dribble...please, please dont buy this album. If you have decent tastes - go right ahead, youll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great record","review":"This is a solid record. It is a cut above most records and bands that are considered a part of this \\"sound\\". Death Cab, however, throws the discriminating ear for a loop by throwing in some pop in with the Sunny Day/emo sound. Other times, however, it sounds like something very far removed from that sound. They obviously like to make the music that makes them happy, which makes for an ecclectic mix of songs. This cd grows on you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta see them play.","review":"I first saw Death Cab last summer at Portland, OR's NXNW music festival. I immediatley made a connection with older Sunny Day Real Estate song writtings. The energy and passion that Death CAB has is electric and energizing in a way that I find captivating. I again saw them at the Velvet Elvis in Seattle and was very happy to find the same passion. I spite of technical difficulties, they rose to the occasion and presented a talented and crisp sounding show without any displays of arrogance or conceit.

Now, in the year 2989, the human race is split into two groups - the Trackers, members of the highly-advanced Amtrak Federation who live in underground cities to escape the radiation of the outside world and dream of rebuilding America as it once was; and the primitive Mutes (short for mutants), who live on the surface and have adapted to the radiation in the atmosphere. The Amtrak Federation, with its lethal technology, is hell-bent on exterminating the Mutes but the Mutes possess magical powers that make them a match for the Trackers. Steve Brickman, a Tracker, joins the air wing of the Federation, but while on a mission he is shot down and captured by Mutes, who make him realise that not everything the rulers of the Federation say is true.

Standout heavy tracks include the title track, Slave to the Grind, Mudkicker, Monkey Business, and Psycho Love. Creepshow is another really good track, and Quicksand Jesus is a solid ballad. The only negative I can say about this album is that it has three ballads, one of which (In A Darkened Room) is a poor song that should not have made the cut; an album this heavy should not have two ballads, let alone three. All in all, though, a really good album which should be in any hair metal fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Hard Rock Disc Period","review":"Every time I go back and listen to \\"Slave to the Grind\\" I am reminded that this is the greatest hard rock record ever made.

It has been absolutely beautifully remastered and is a glorious performance. The whole thing is wonderfully integrated and the spine-tingling, nobilmente return of the main theme at the end of the final movement seems so much a natural result of its first appearance some 40 minutes before that it is unusually touching as well as exciting. The performance is not flawless ; the LPO was finding its feet after the War and facing real financial hardship, a situation Boult's distinguished leadership did much to rectify in time. If anything - and if possible - 'In the South', which Boult went through as a young man at the composer's elbow, is even better. This CD is essential for Elgar enthusiasts, both historically and because of the intrinsic excellence of the interpretations.

As a long-time fan of Scottish historicals, I was excited to see a new author of this very popular subgenre. Ms. Brown's first book has everything the savvy historical reader demands. The hero, Gilchrist, is the kind of hero I love--a true tragic hero with scars not only on the outside, but deep within as well. The heroine, Rachel, has been struck by her own tragedy--she is found by Gilchrist at the legendary virgin spring, and does not know who she is. The gradual revelation of her true identity brings on treachery and betrayal that nearly threatens to tear Gilchrist's clan apart, as well as Gilchrist himself. Set against the cold, harsh highlands, with excellent, interesting secondary characters, The Virgin Spring is a terrific read. I am excited by this new author and hope that she and Harlequin stay partners for a long time to come.

As of late however, I became more and more upset with the brilliance of the children, each of whom is unique in some way, and somehow gets involved in plot after contrived plot. Nevertheless, I decided to give Hoax a try as the premise of a murdered rap star sounded interesting. You don't even get into the murder until well into the book and in the meantime you are forced to endure the unending drivel about Karp's conflict in running for office and another history of Native American ritual.

I found the plotting of the book along with the flash backs to explain previous action to be interesting and helpful and with so many previous books in the series, some explanation of the history of the characters is necessary for a first time reader.

I kept reading and wondering why the repetition? Where was the snappy dialogue? Why none of the former energy? Why am I continuing to read this?

One of the most boring and poorly constructed books in the English language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I am now skimming past page 400, wondering what happened to what had been an interersting series. Now I'm here and I found out: the ghost writer quit.Anyway, I'll finish, although I know evil will be vanquished even though I'm not sure good will be served. Everyone else has said it: this is preachy, stagnant and filled with mistakes from the major to the mundane. It doesn't take two hours to get from Manhattan to Rockland Coung. More like 45 minutes. And Mount Vernon is not a wealthy suburb of New York but a very middle-class, integrated and, in some sections, downright poor. But there's worse to go with the cardboard characters and about a half book of past history and the psyche of the Karp/Ciampi famil. I've even figured out a plot twist that I'm sure will take place at or near the end.Bye.I'm about to check out Mr. Gruber's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hoax\\" as a metaphor for the whole book","review":"Starting in the second chapter, I was wondering if the title \\"Hoax\\" refers to the book itself - that this one was not written by Tannenbaum at all. It could also have been called \\"Joke\\" because that's what this book is. Unimaginative writing, squirrely plot, sudden reappearance of every past main character in the series, unintelligent thought processes.Now I find that the whole series was a hoax, i.e. ghostwritten. How funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a bad novel","review":"If I want to read about a superhero, I can read about Lucas Davenport or go to Marvel or DC comics. Karp is big, powerful, superintelligent, and pretty flawless. His wife is beautiful, deadly, sexy, etc... Daughter speaks 40 languages, son (tragically blind) is a musical genuis, etc. etc. etc... The bad guy is one-dimensional (a sure clue to that comes from the repeated descriptions of how many artificial dimensions he has). The good guys are perfection down to their all-to-human flaws. Basically, everyone's a caricature straight out of the basic airport bookstore mystery/thriller novel.This was my first Tanenbaum novel and sadly I will have to continue my search for a new author to read. He can turn a phrase well, and I find his writing easy to read. However, the plot is thin, the people aren't believable, and there's always a hero wherever one is needed. His story is based in reality, but bears no resemblance to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank you all for the explaination","review":"I'm half way through the book, couldn't take it any more, so jumped on the internet to see if I could find out what's going on. Thanks for the heads-up about the probable ghost writer for the earlier Butch Karp novels. I considered the series some of the best of popular fiction. This nose dive into plodding self importance is astonishing.I was thinking Haox is something like a 600 page comic book but that really isn't fair to comic books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A letdown after previous novels","review":"What happened to Tanenbaum's writing ability? The plot is OK, but the characters seem stiff and unreal compared with previous novels about the same people. Worst of all, sentences are clumsy.

The characters, main & new, are not alive in Hoax. The usual authenticity is gone as well; I worked with gang members for years and found the portrayal of bangers a laughable, insulting stereotype. Please stop describing people as \\"well knit\\", you used the term 3 times, that I noticed, in this book (Usually you've used only once in pervious books)This is the only time a Karp novel has bored me.

This series used to be one of the most sophisticated, character-driven, plot-rich series around, with sidebars of brainy, funny riffs on the nature of urban, rainbow living in NYC, insane bureaucracies and the compromise necessary to applying the law. Even when the coincidences piled on too deep, you didn't care because the writing was so good and the characters so compelling. The only exceptions were the times Gruber wasn't acknowledged in the front of the book.Now it's just one more cardboard character, idiotically plotted, oh-so-boring wastes of time.

This is not the same writer, and not the same family I've enjoyed through the years. I've read every one of the Butch Karp books and never been disappointed until now. The writer romanticised the Taos area and naively portrayed the Taos Indians, Hispanics,and \\"anglos.\\" There was very little of the usual action, and much dissertation about the American Southwest (inaccurate and naive, as I mentioned above), so that the story could have been written in 1/3 of the pages present.The family characters weren't nearly as piquant or alive as usual, and really behaved in ways that aren't consistent with any of the other books.I don't intend to read another by this \\"author.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is the real author?","review":"I don't know who wrote this, but it couldn't have been the Robert Tanenbaum I've followed loyally for years.

As a great fan of the Karp/Ciampi partnership, I am horrified to admit that I read this tepid installment. The story is largely told retrospectively, with a plot point revealed then a long and tedious explanation as to how it all happened, and a good quarter of the book is taken up by rehashing ancient history. The villains are straight out of a comic book and should have had blood dripping from fangs and horns growing from their heads to complete the picture. The dialogue is weak, the plot ludicrous (the long-suffering Lucy is lassooed in mid-cliff-plunge by a cowboy!!) and on a completely different note, the sub-editor should be shot - a murder of cows????? Please - that's the sloppiest typo I've seen in years. The whole mess reads like it was constructed from old bits of paper swept up by Tanenbaum's housekeeper from under his desk.

He waited out the night, but he did not sleep at all the next few days. He made a shelter, and he got food supplies. He got a shotgun out of the plane. He was attacked by a bear, and he has seen two wolves, rabbits, birds and small bugs. If you want too find out if he lives or dies, then you will have to read it yourself.The book is not that good because the author does not put enough feeling into it. Like when the bear attacks him, the author says the bear attacks him. He did not say it well enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian's Winter","review":"Gary Paulsen's book Brian's Winter is the story of what would have happened had Brian not been rescued as he was in his first book Hatchet. I enjoyed this sequel very much and couldn't put it down after I picked it up. The only reason I give this book 4 out of 5 stars is because of what I feel was an anticlimactic ending. This is a perfect book for a rainy weekend when you have nothing to do. I recommend that before reading Brian's Winter that you read Hatchet since it is referred to often and you may miss a few points if you don\`t. This is a good book for readers who enjoy nature, but keep in mind that sometimes nature can be gory. This is a very good book and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian's Winter","review":"Brian's WinterGary Paulsen is the author of Brian's Winter. I believe that Gary's purpose for writing this novel was to show some survival skill that could help anyone in the wilderness. Also, Gary gives good descriptions of the settings, characters, and as you read his book you'll feel as if you're in it to.Brian was the main character in the story. He does not really know how to survive, but in time he learns. Brian also learns to hunt, cook, listen to nature, and construct several things in the wild. At the beginning of the story Brian is home sick and lonely, but as he gets used to all the nature he calls it home and wants to stay.I would rate this book a four out of five. Because it was well written and kept my interest through the whole book. I would highly recommend this book to any one who has the slightest bit of interest in nature.

When I had realized what he was going through all by him self and his life on the line, I realized what if that was me. I had realized what he had to do to stay alive such as kill many animals for food, or build a sturdy shelter for protection, and some animal skin for warmth. I really liked this book because it taught me a lot of useful things and the author helped me picture a lot of images in my head. I disliked how the author put some words that I did not understand. Brian was the main character that showed skill, different attitudes, and ways of survival. I would rate this book a 9 out of 10 because I really liked this book. I would recommend this book for all ages, I think it is a great book and it deserves to be honored."},{"rating":"2","title":"brians winter","review":"A boy named Brian was 12 years old when he was in a plane crash and was trapped out in the wilderness, for about a little under a year. Brain was able to survive through the summer, and one day while he was cleaning some grouse meat he realized that winter was coming on fast.When Brain realized winter was coming he made a shelter that sat next to a rock, and used the rock as part of this shelter, and the rest was made of tree braches and three inches of mud. After that, he realized that he needed to make bigger and tougher bow and arrows. In the end of the story brain realizes that winter had pasted and he had made it through it.During the spring he went out to the crashed plane and got the emergency kit, he brought it bake to land were he found a plane receiver. He accidentally leaves it on and a day later he is rescued. I liked this book because it gives realistic information about how a person could survive in the wilderness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"After starting this book I was amazed with how captivating it was from the first page until the end.

Paulsen really hit a homerun with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian's Winter","review":"Brian's WinterHave you ever been camping? You were out in the wilderness, but it was controlled. Brian in \\"Brian's Winter\\" was trapped in the wilderness. With only his common sense he had to survive. I will be telling you what I thought of the novel.Gary Paulsen wrote this novel called \\"Brian's Winter\\". If you liked Hatchet you will love this book. Gary wrote this as a sequel to tell people what would have happened if Brian had to live through the winter. His descriptions of the setting were so in depth that you could see it in your mind.Brian was a young teenager maybe 14 years old. He didn't have a lot of common sense about the wilderness, but he learned quickly. He really did not know things that everyone should know about the wilderness. He was a teen so what can you expect.I thought this book was okay not a great book, but a good read. I gave it a 3 out of five. I didn't like the main character, but I liked the way the book was told. It was very descriptive."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"In 6th grade i read the book before this and i thought wow that was ok.

The overall length (neck to ankles) was good, hips fit... however torso length was horrifically short giving her a painful neoprene wedgie, it also did not fit at all snug at her shoulders and waist which would have meant it waould be less efficient at keeping her warm. As we were headed for a boogie board outing to celebrate her birthday, we ended up buying anO'Neill Women's Epic II 3/2 CT (Black)Size 6 at a local retailer( She loves her new O'Neill and whenever I see her in it I think she could be their next wetsuit model) . I've returned the NeoSport to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit","review":"I thought if I was honest and didn't care about the size I had to order I'd get a great suit for the price. I usually wear a 2 so I ordered an 8 per their size and weight recommendations. Needless to say it did not fit. It was as if someone just randomly cut and designed the suit. Loose on the arms, tight on the legs, the body was almost misshapen, cut sort of weird. We went to a store where I tried on several suits that ALL FIT snugly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Visions","review":"After an album like Galleries, I never thought these amazing MC's would be able to create a follow-up album just as good as the old one.

I was extremely disappointed bythe novel. I had hard time believing that the same woman whowrote the brilliant *Like Water for Chocolate* also wrote*The Law of Love.* The narrative seemed overly self-conscious,even hollow in spots. The blend of future technology withcurrent day remnants seemed corny. I found myself skippingover the new-age/psycho-babble stuff. I had a difficult timerelating to the characters. In the end I felt like the novelwas a good concept, but not a good book. The multimedia additionsdidn't make up for the mediocre story and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap... a loser compared to Like Water For Chocolate.....","review":"What unbelievable garbage.... the only salvagable part was the CD that came with the wasted paper that is a so called book.... so disappointing after reading the great first book by her...

Nevertheless, this was both the most poorly written and poorly conceived book I've read in a long time (if ever!). The writing style reminded me of that of an overstimulated teenager, and the characters were all but empty of substance. What I found most appalling, however, were the ridiculous new-age pseudophilosophies, and the horrendous misinterpretations of karma and reincarnation. Honestly, the whole thing was so bad it was just embarrassing. So glad it was a loaner, not a purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author doesn't seem to care, why should we?","review":"This book should never have hit the press. It reads like a work in process that needs at least two more revisions. The last 25 pages or so read like she threw it together in an afternoon just to get the darn thing finished. The story is sloppy -- there are problems with characters leaping to conclusions and consequences in a single bound. Esquivel makes the classic mistake of any Creative Writing 101 student -- she tells us instead of shows us. We have to suffer through pages of boring narative just to get the point. In short, if the author can't bother working on the story line, why should we bother reading it? Laura Esquivel has the ability to be a wonderful writer, but you'd never know it from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst book I have ever read.","review":"I can find nothing of value in this book except perhaps the nice drawings. Since this review is to be less than 1000 words, I cannot hope to list all that I found lacking in the book. I will list a couple of problems, however. First, the book is a poor imitation of the magic realisim genre typified by Garcia Marquez. Second, the characters are as flat as central Illinois. Third, the book contradicts itself in several places (when the author is trying to be serious). Fourth, there is no plot, just a sequence of events. Fifth, the philosophical attempts are poorly done, relying on catch phrases and nice sounding words rather than on substance. Sixth, it shares much with the fairy tales of youth in that nothing bad can ever happen to the characters without some solution dropping out of thin air. I would not recommend this book to anyone. Well, maybe to potential authors to see how not to write a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Helps to Understand Mexico and Mexicans","review":"I loved the book, couldn't put it down, but then I have lived in Mexico for several years and 'got it'.I found it entertaining from start to finish, and apart from Richard Russo's \\"Straight Man\\", I've never laughed out loud so many times while reading.The references to the TV, taquerias, etc, were very tongue-in-cheek and although I don't think it's critical, it helps a lot to know modern Mexican culture.The TV anchorman is a descendant of the famous Zabludovsky family, currently father and son are both quite famous anchormen.I don't think that the book lost anything in translation, I read it in English first (I learned Spanish as an adult), but a lot of it is a running 'inside joke' for the audience for which it was written: Mexicans.But even if you aren't familiar with Mexico, if you liked \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\", you'll like this one, as well.I have enjoyed all of Esquivel's works. I can't wait for another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much preaching, not enough story","review":"I'm not sure if the translation made it worse, but the novel failed to interest me with language or plot. I love \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" and also enjoyed \\"Swift as Desire\\". Though her attempt to bring together the experience of words, music, and visuals was notable, Esquivel was too often rambling rather than poetic. Her characters are largely undeveloped, and except for perhaps the first chapter, we are not convinced of anyone's thoughts or actions. Furthermore, I found the demon's and guardian angel's intrusions into the story particularly bothersome. Overall, I felt this book was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoyed Like Water For Chocolate, avoid this book","review":"I loved Like Water For Chocolate and was excited to find that Laura Esquivel had written another book. The synopsis inside the book jacket sounded very interesting to me. However, after the first chapter of this book, I was put off by the disjointed plot.The author employs much the same style as in her first attempt, but the book disintegrates into a disjointed science fiction story filled with violent images.I took this book out of the library (thank goodness I didn't waste good money on buying a copy) and thus did not hear the CD that came with it to complete the multimedia assault; I may have missed an integral part of the experience, but I doubt it. The drawings included in the book were pointless, in my opinion.I finished this book only for pride. I applaud Ms. Esquivel's efforts to produce a wide variety of works, but this book was just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"the author has a wonderful imagination.","review":"This story gave a vivid concept of love through a messenger of spanish decent. A romance that captured a life from the city of atlantis to the year 2300. This book covered the bible ,reincarnation ,love and evil,the devil and angels of God. It showed us the future and how it could be,the past and all the past lives of the souls involved.

With her book, Like Water for Chocolate, Esquivel proved herself as a wonderfully imaginitive and passionate writer. I'm not sure what happened with this, her latest book. The basic premis was good, but for whatever reason, Esquivel was unable to pull it together. It was sloppy and boring and sappy. The only good thing about this book was the wonderful CD of music that came with it. With all this said, I do look forward to reading her next book. This woman has talent! She needs to rely less on gimmicks and more on her own magical story-telling abilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed themes, Bad story-telling","review":"Mexico hundreds of years from now: people regressing to past lives through music, communicating with plants by amazing new technology, and uniting with their twin souls through ethereal lovemaking. Sounds fascinating, but this book ultimately lived up to none of my expectations. The characters are ultra-flat, the plot is silly and stilted, and the recurring themes would be laughable if they weren't so disturbing: The quality of one's life is utterly out of one's control, since it is determined part and parcel by what we've done in our past lives? Rape is a crime of passion and misunderstanding, rather than of violence? People can only learn through direct experience, not ever through reason or imagination? Yikes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative format; bad story","review":"As with her previous book, \\"Like Water for Chocolate\\" (which is much better), the author tries to break convention by introducing a multi-senses experience to her story with the music on the provided CD which you are suppose to play when you're reading. However, creative expression is no excuse to neglect the storytelling. As with her previous book, she uses shock value to keep you reading, which isn't necessarily bad. However, while the book starts out on solid ground, the quality quickly degrades as she uses New Age ideologies to explain events, that by the end of the book, I felt she wasted an interesting beginning by sloppy writing to quickly end the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Water for Chocolate meets Richd. Condon's Money is Love","review":"A great book, if a little bumpy in places.Water/Chocolate looked at the fantasy of the effect of the cook's mindset on the effect that food has on the eaters. Money is Love explores what happens when the entire set of gods--Judeo/Christian, Greeks, Romans, and the baddies, Lucifer, Beelzebub and that bunch--meet to figure out what the big deal is about Money. Everyone on earth seems to be going bananas to get it, they do strange things with it when they do get it, etc.In Money/Love, N'zuriel (\\"Little Yaweh\\") leads the convention to figure it all out. In Law of Love, we find that 14000 reincarnations determine peoples' suitabilties for governing, loving, hating. Hard to believe that Esquivel hasn't read and admired Condon.But the work isn't derivative: it's wonderfully original and refreshing. And it's almost as funny as Condon's, a very big plus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the dances!","review":"I enjoyed the book, but I loved the dance songs sung by Liliana Felipe.

Laura Esquivel did a great job of mixing Magical Realism and Sci-Fi to give the reader a humorous look at the meaning of life. I loved it, and think Woody Allen could do a great job of making a movie of it. WARNING: Don't read this book if you're looking for something serious. This story is funny and magical and a great way to spend a relaxing weekend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book I've read","review":"This book had some interesting views on reincarnation and what the future might be like, but I found the story and characters otherwise lacking. It was far too \\"preachy\\". In other words, the author seems to use the book to give her opinions on love and life that could easily have been summed up in a short essay. Instead, she uses a few watered-down characters to deliver a lot of poorly constructed points."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money and time","review":"When I read the plot description for this book - I was excited about reading something different and unusual. Despite a nice cover and intriguing topic promised, I have found myself listening to the most boring and primitive audio book ever. Hoping to find something good about it towards the end at least I was truly dissapointed. The book is too simple, too plain, too predictable. It reminds me of the story you tell to a child while making things up as you go. When the characters seem to be in trouble, magically something appears to resque them without any additional preview of its existence in the first place. The language is very plain and constant description of something trivial simplifies characters' feelings and thoughts, while they could seem very deep and significant to the reader if done otherwise. There is no magic, just a collection of events full naive of trivia."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Law of love, I love it!","review":"The Law of Love, is my favorite book.

Having listened to much of Cacavas' music over a period of several years, this first-rate collection of songs is an expected pleasure.

Ghosts?","review":"A confusing, muddled horror film about a terrifying night in a Japanese hospital. There's malpractice and a conspiracy to cover it up. There's some kind of disease that seems to be spread psychically and affects the perceptions of anyone who catches it, so that they don't know whether they are hallucinating or not. The problem is that the viewer doesn't know either. There were a couple of points where I thought I had a workable explanation for what was happening, but then something would happen to contradict it, especially at the end. I'm forced to conclude that director Masayuki Ochiai just decided to throw everything in and, if he had any idea of what was going on, he was incapable of conveying it to me./"},{"rating":"2","title":"A dark, atmospheric, creepy little movie....","review":"I guess I'm old school when it comes to horror these days, and Infection worked for me. Less is more in the horror genre as far as what is shown to us, and this movie follows that rule very well. I hate it when reviews give everything away, so in a nutshell: A decaying hospital (as well as healthcare system) is the setting for this nicely done thriller. Fear of illness, infection, hospitals, the dark, doctors.... they're all covered here. A botched death at the hands of doctors, a mysterious patient dropped off at the E.R., a hospital with very dark rooms and corridors, an aggressive virus that disolves it's host. The movie really builds tension, and the payoff does not insult the viewer. Most horror films today are pretty silly, and this was a nice little gem to discover.

They took a highly ambitious concept and an obvious lack of budget and turned it into a minor masterpiece of ingenuity. I loved the camera work, the editing, the acting, the inspired use of lights and shadows, and the breakneck speed of the film. I was mesmerized at the outset and hoped they didn't ruin it with a crappy ending; I really wanted to add this film to my collection. Unfortunately, the ending is ambiguous and not a little perplexing. For some reason I liked that.

I have seen them on tour and followed the birth of other Ersatz Audio bands such as Magas and the much mentioned Tamion 12 inch. I have to say I feel this album is either a case of flattery or a lame attempt to rip off another band. I saw Tamion 12 inch open up for Adult. in Detroit and New York and they were what Adult. became. Not to mention they were playing guitars long before Adult. The vocals of Tamion's B Kerry are by far superior to Nikola's sub standard wailing. I have been in the music business for years and I know a sham when I see one. Very disappointing.

I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in the new design. It bends forward when you push the Dispense button and you can't fill this one up like the old design because it runs all over the countertop. The ON button at the back top is better than where it used to be. That's right: I hate the new design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, but functional","review":"This product makes small amounts of hot water in about 1 minute. The problem is that it is rather noisy. The first time I used it at work, my cubicle mates asked why there was a rainstorm going on. Now i'm very self-conscience about using it.

This is my third one (the previous two each lasted over a decade!). And it really heats up the water. So from this point of view, it is fantastic. But my previous two were made from a hard plastic. This one the exterior is a soft plastic and has lots of give to it. But if you leave it in one place it probably will be fine.This comes with a nice ceramic bowl, probably for hot ceral. But I actually use it in the kitchen as a temporary holding bowl while cooking. So this is a great extra bonus!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it Everyday","review":"My sister told me about this product about 2 years ago. I bought one and LOVE IT!Use it every day.

It's also available in black."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift for College Student","review":"For the last 8 years or so, I've been giving the hotshot to my relatives as a college gift. My children, nieces, nephews and cousins are always so happy to get one and I always get an excited phone call about how happy they are with it. They've all said that it is mostly what they use in their dorms to make tea, hot chocolate, soup or whatever. Those that have graduated still use the hotshot. So, I decided to buy one for myself. The hotshot is so easy. I plug it in, add water, press one button and in 30 seconds the water is piping hot for tea or soup. The hotshot is easier than using a microwave. And, I never thought I would say this, but its faster than the microwave.

There are three songs on this album, one I dedicate to members who are or who have served in arm forces around the world.

Mr. Rogers performance of \\"The King's Soldier\\" helps me to remember those who have served distinguishly and with honor. Secondly, there are soldiers who believe in Christ the King and some of the lyrics truly fits what they are doing.My second favorite is \\"The Messiah.\\" It has a wonderful chorus and the words are simple, yet to me inspiring.Finally, a fantastic duet can be heard in \\"Mary did you know,\\" performed by Winonna Judd and Kenny Rogers. They sing with truth and conviction.As for the other songs, I did like hearing them but not as much as the others that I have mentioned. I hope you'll like this album as I did.Merry Christmas to all and good night"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I have been a die-hard Kenny Rogers fan since I was four years old and sang \\"The Gambler\\" to everyone who visited our home.

Her \\"Blond Ambition,\\" and \\"Girlie Show\\" was her best, but she kind of tried a little too hard on this one to impress the audience. Although I must say this is a really good show, but it isn't her best. She didn't sing any of her old songs (Besides \\"La Isla Bonits,\\" and \\"Holiday\\".) I mean, she could have atleast sung \\"Rain,\\" \\"Vogue,\\" \\"I'll Remember,\\" \\"Take A Bow,\\" \\"Bedtime Story,\\" or \\"Material Girl,\\", and I also thought she could of done a better performance of \\"La Isla Bonita,\\" \\"Holiday,\\" and \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl (Spanish Version).\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Madonna's frenzied Tour","review":"We were very disappointed with this concert video.

The DVD didn't fare any better. Here is Madonna at her all time lowest on stage. The production numbers are aweful to say the least. Watch Madonna re enact scenes stolen from anime cartoons as she swings like a monkey and faux fights Ninja style. Witness Madonna faux play an electric guitar in a way that would make Santana, Page and Hendrix squirm!!! This isn't far fetched since Madonna is doing this same boring number on her new Re Invention Tour. Maddy dancing with a stick??? Say it isn't so??? This show is an utter waste of time and money no matter what her blind fans will say. There is a time when we have to wake up and admit that some entertainers are over the hill and dried up. Madonna is absolutely no exeption. She is tired, old, very old to be doing this and her best days are completely done. Pack it Madonna we want our money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I have been a Madonna fan for four years now, and have found this show to be amazing and quite an experience!

Although the DVD cannot capture the actual endorphins of the crowd, it is the next best thing to being there. For those who have never seen Madonna live, this is the closest thing to actually being there. Don't expect Madonna to get up there and crune out some of her older hits like 'Vogue' and 'Express Yourself'. Instead, you will see amazing reinditions of some of her later works like the opening 'Drowned World' and the phenominal, foot stopming encore of 'Music'. Madonna puts on a great performance, there's no question. The theatrical staging, visuals, and choreographing has Madonna written all over it. I highly recommend the Drowned World DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it 0 stars?","review":"I thought that the songs sucked. Her voice is great but everything else sucked.

I've seen her BLONDE AMBITION and GIRLIE SHOW tours (on video) before so I was ready for this one. I have to say that much of it is hype. It was a good concert but it was sort of dull at times. The costume changes were'nt as great and there wasn't a lot of dancing. Madonna played the guitar here and there... that was new. The bull ride that she did in \\"don't tell me/human nature\\" was way too short. It wasn't even worth mentioning. Some people described the geisha themed segment as \\"awesome\\" and \\"magical\\" but I found it to be OK at best. She flew across the stage.. BIG DEAL. She did an air spin like a scene out of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON... cool. I thought it looked cool but it didn't live up to the hype. And what the heck was up with that anime video thing? It was weird. So, I was a bit disappointed at times. MADONNA DROWNED WORLD TOUR ends with her hit \\"music.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Own","review":"Absolutely loved this concert.

Overall 8/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna at her finest","review":"This DVD has a lot to offer the true Madonna fan as well as someone who wants to witness an amazing spectacle. As always, Madonna used the then top of the line staging equipment and techniques which made this a very sleak production. The set list was really invaluable and just goes without saying. A cool note to the big Madonna fans is that during La Isla Bonita, you can see Rosie O'Donnell in the front row taking pictures during the concert, which were used for the cover of the DVD. She is credited with photography on the back of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST !!!!!","review":"I was thinking of actually buying tickets to that Detroit concert, but with a price of over $200 I decided not to. Wow, what a mistake!!! After buying the DVD and watching it several times, I can't believe that I missed this awesome, once-in-a-lifetime experience to watch this incredible show live. It is truly an amazing and breathtaking concert and one can only imagine what it must have been like seeing it live. Madonnas creativity and performance are just stunning. I can recommend this DVD to anyone - it's worth every single penny. Enjoy and have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has done better","review":"I saw the show in person on August 2, 2001 in NJ, and I wasn't very impressed. The show would have been much better if she did more older songs. I'm not to sure what she has against her old song, considering that most of them are better than her new songs. Sitting on hay and playing the gutiar and flying through the air dressed as some Japanese shmuck doesn't really sit well with me. It just doesn't seem like Madonna. The one good song however was La Isla Bonita, but if she had to pick an older song to sing, why did she sing that one? She did sing it on the Girlie Show. And overall the show was way to short. She could have added about 5 more songs. I really would only buy this if you are a huge Madonna fan and you need to have it. Other wise, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST TOUR EVER CREATED","review":"Yes Madonna created that tour and it seems to be the best any artist can come up with. Very capturing and breathtaking and simply the best. Since human creations are not 100 % than the only drawback for this tour (for other people and not for the hardcore fans) is that she did few from her old hits (Like A Prayer, Papa Don't Preach, Express Yourself and even her new hits Like American Pie and You'll See , although she did You'll See on some dates but was not included here) Anither Drawback for the fans and the other people is that there is no extra features (...) like the Don't Tell me Video or Making of Documentary just small picture galary. But still a perfect item to have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Madonna rules!","review":"For the longest time I rejected Madonna music: it just didn't go with me, I disliked it. But since she released the 'Ray of Light' album, and then with 'Music' (both of which are at the core of the set list for this concert) her music took off to a new level in my eyes, thanks largely to the production of William Orbit.Now, this concert is simply mindblowing. It's all you could ever wish for in a live performance and more, since Madonna always pushes the envelope with her visuals and her open flirting with sexuality, and this one is no exception. My favorite moment in the concert, the transition between the two Spanish songs, \\"Lo Que Siente la Mujer (What It Feels Like for a Girl)\\" and \\"La Isla Bonita.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave my DVD away","review":"I supposedly had bought the last ticket available for the Concert when it was scheduled for Continental Airlines Arena at Meadowlands, NJ., and I was supposed to see it in August 2001. However, because of a sore throat, Madonna cancelled. Boy, am I glad she did and I received my money back. I would have trekked out there alone, by public transportation and been BORED TO DEATH. I know because I bought the DVD to see the \\"concert\\" I missed. Didn't miss anything. She doesn't even seem to have been there herself. I was so disappointed that I gave my DVD away. All her previous concerts were great, so don't know what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not An Impressive Instant","review":"I saw the Drowned World Tour live 3 times, twice here in New York and once in Atlanta. When I saw the HBO special I was completely unimpressed. First of all, in 95% of US venues, Madonna performed You'll See live in place of the flat, blase Gone. The live version of You'll See completely blows Gone out of the water. For some strange reason, Madonna decided to showcase Gone on the HBO performance. DWT is something that must be seen live, and it lost a lot on the HBO performance. To whomever said that they didn't understand why it was a dark concert, many of the themes on Ray of Light were quite dark and choosing not to understand a \\"dark performance\\" is rather superficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Very Well!","review":"We have a 1 year old Beagle/Boston Terrier Mix, and she loves to take off when she sees other people or animals.

I own a boxer and he is by far one of the strongest willed of his breed. When the collar and remote communicate as described, he obeys without fail. Unfortunately, after only a week the remote and collar would only work sporadically. It has never been in the water, dropped or even chewed on. It just quit working!

I used to call her and she would stand and just look at me - deciding whether she wanted to respond. Now she comes when called. I have never had to use this above a 2 level. She now hears the warning tone and responds. I previously purchased a less expensive model by PetSafe and returned it. It worked inconsistently and you could not depend on it when needed. The design was also heavier and ackward on a small dog. To those who wonder, I tried it on myself before I put it on the dog. The lower levels were like a small buzz and I did not really feel it until the level 7. I would definately recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I've had two of these collars for more than two years. I use them almost every day. My dogs do everything with the collars, including swimming. The collars are incredibly durable, both my collars have gouges and scratches.If you follow the training instructions you will very good results with training. Both my dogs were off leash trained in under 2 weeks. Remember though, this is not a punishment device.My only complaint is the remote, its too small. With gloves (winter time) on you cannot push just one button.I originally tried the two dog system, forget about that. You need one remote per dog, you cannot stimulate both dogs at the same time with the two dog system. This is useful when the dogs take off after something at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do the trick","review":"I tried this product for over three weeks. The remote battery lost charge quickly and the collar did not make good contact with my dog. The truth is that the negative tone should be enough to get your dogs attention but with this product the tone is inaudible and so my dog did not pay attention to it. I used the 400 yard and park petsafe collar on my other dog at the same time and had the opposite experience. The collar worked at a low voltage and the negative tone is loud enough to get the dogs attention so I don't ever have to use the shock feature.

Four times replaced the collar and the hand held and once the charger. This product does not hold a charge and although it indicates it is fully charged it isn't. I have charged the the collar put new batteries in the hand held and within a few hours the collar is not working. This happens time and time again. When you need to rely on the collar you can't.

Hopefully I can find one more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total joke!","review":"I was very disappointed it would not work consistantly.

I have never been able to get the collar to \\"click.\\" It apparently does not fit correctly. There are lights on the unit to indicate the collar status, but when the collar in on the dog, you cannot see the lights, so they are of no use.

The transmitter is better than the two other Innotek ones that I have owned.The part I don't care for is the collar. It has a clasp like a belt instead of the quick snap collars that they used to have and it is very stiff. I feel like it is almost choking the dog to put it on. Once on it is fine.The other problem is that the LEDs on the collar are so dim that unless you are staring at the collar in low light you cannot tell if the collar has been activated or not (I have little high frequency hearing and cannot hear the beep).The charger is nice, but it should include the transmitter, or what is the point?My dog does not respond to it as well as the previous Innotek collar either."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!!!","review":"Cuban MamboThis is not what it seems.

First, he needs to state that he has a biased interest in his review, that he used to work with Walter at Hill & Associates before he went to work for Juniper. Second, I was the reviewer for the first edition of the book and Walter had a lot of misconceptions about SONET in the original draft. So much so that my name is menitioned in the acknoweldgements in the first edition. Since I worked as a manager dealing with SONET at both AT&T as well as Cisco Systems,the book leaves a lot to be desired. He is very verbose in his writing style and has never worked in the field to give the reader a real understanding of the issues that come with understanding SONET - both services and equipment. There are other books in the field that do a better job - Andy Reid is a good one from the technical side for example - but this author needs to change his writing style and tone it down for this book to be considered for readership seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not your book if you want hardcore technical details","review":"I can recommend this book to everyone who wants to get an overview on SDH/SONET capabilities and/or products but does not care for the protocol itself.But if you're looking for a good and correct description of the inner workings of the protocol you'd better not waste your time with this book.

While they're not exactly built to last long term if you are careful with them they'll work fine.The reason I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was simply because you have to punch out the precut pieces of each stencil yourself.

Otherwise they're good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"This is one of those strange little albums that is hard to categorize, like the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, or Moondog. This is NOT a Television album, nor does it fit in with his works that include vocals.

The older style foil head gives a faster, closer shave and is much preferred by me. Now I have a Pulsonic shaver with two heads that I don't really find very satisfying.

Every member of the band contributes flawlessly to the overall picture. It is very technical and kick-a$$. Some parts are similar to the work of Necrophagist, so if you like them, you'll probably like Akeldama. The only downside to this album is the length of it. I would have been more satisfied with a few more songs in the same vein. But that is a small complaint, and won't be enough to warrant a lower rating. Akeldama is my introduction to The Faceless. I was drawn to it by album samples on another website and the reviews here at Amazon. Overall I am very pleased with it and plan to buy \\"Planetary Duality\\" as well. The Faceless is a very talented band!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Just happened to stumble upon The Faceless on myspace, heard 3 songs off the album, Pestilence, An Autopsy and The Ghost of a Stranger. I'm very please with the technical side, being that it isn't so technical that it becomes absurd, but there is enough to make you understand the capability of this band. The guitars are great, very precise riffing and pleasantly melodic solos. Dare I say they are in the same vain as Death, well you can hear influences anyway. As far as the bass player goes, lets just say that somewhere near the end of Ghost of a Stranger, he plays a bass riff that made my hairs on my arm stand up. Marco Pitruzzella does a great job on the drums with nice 64th note dbl bass, gravity blast beats, extremely fast fills. Great job guys, I can't wait to hear the rest of this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LEICA!!!","review":"There are enough lengthy reviews here so I will keep mine short. This album was my first introduction to Technical Death Metal and I would not likely change that for anything. The Faceless generate some interesting music for most of the album until you get to \\"Leica\\"[Amazon has this song mis-labled as \\"Leira\\"]. I knew once it started it was going to be good but as the song progressed it just went from good to incredible. The album finishes up nicely afterward, but every time I go back to this album I go straight to Leica first. I guarantee it to be one of the best metal songs you will ever hear.It's all good.

I love how he tells stories in songs. His lyrics are catchy at times, while other times, the song breaks your heart. \\"Rose Bouquet\\" tells of perfect love gone sour, \\"Six Pack Summer\\" is just about kicking it, and my favorite \\"That's When I Love You\\" is upbeat and is what any girl would want her boyfriend/husband to say.

Mr Pinchbeck doesn't really have anything new to say, nor does he impart any real \\"wow\\" moments. In discussing mystical/spiritual ideas it is true that what we are trying to talk about is \\"beyond words\\", but words can point in the direction of the suchness if the speaker has really had an enlightenment experience. I don't think Mr. Pinchbeck has had that experence. He is lost in intellectualization; I would advise him to \\"go back to the breath\\". I do think he wants to make money by compiling what others have said about the topic. But even those he quotes extensively seem to be as lost as he is. A waste of money; without soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS!","review":"I love books on this type of subject.....except this one. It held my interest for the first few chapters, then it seemed to be just rambling episodes of psychedelic \\"flashbacks\\" that are passed off as communications with other beings from other dimensions. The author even admits that some of these episodes may be his own beliefs played out through the hallucinogen. I don't think one \\"enlightened\\" person mentioned in the book had \\"higher\\" experiences without the aid of some kind of hallucinogenic drug. I'm opened minded about the existence of UFO's, crop circles and aliens, other dimensions, etc., but this book in no way furthers my belief in any of those things. The author has obviously done way to much experimenting with psychedelics for this book to be taken as anything even close to credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Case You're Interested in 2012 & Quetzalcoatl","review":"Reads like a 'vocabularily'-inclined high school senior's book report. Topics covered are virtually limitless, save for 2012 and Quetzalcoatl, which are relegated to a few lines here and there within the first 200 pages. He later goes into more depth on these topics, as one would hope, but delves also into an autobiography that he seems to deem relevant. He blames his pathetic relationships with women on evil spirits, past lives, etc He has virtually no original thoughts but creates some interesting juxtapositions from the wealth of books he's read. He thinks he was chosen by Quetzalcoatl to deliver message to us........ He thinks we needn't be monogamous, yet he cannot successfully maintain a relationship with one woman who he, btw, has a child with."},{"rating":"1","title":"2012 and a total waste of time","review":"I was dragged in by the title, I have an interest in the Mayan calendar, and thought this might be interesting. I think a far more apt title would be 2012 - the peurile ramblings of a loser. When a book starts with chapters about how the author has done all sorts of mind-altering drugs like that is a testament as to his credibility, it's not a good sign. There are some references to events and cycles that touch on the subject of a change in 2012, but they are disjointed and really don't work. Then there are shifts to what seems to be a rambling journal about the author leaving his wife and child to go lie in crop circles, hit on other women, look for better drugs, and can't figure out why his relationship is going away.sheesh.

This quote from Pinchy himself on RealSanInc...'We aren't charging for this and I ask that you buy my old book and soon,my new one...FREQUENTLY' Obviously Daniel is not yet to enter the new paradigm until he's milked the old one dry.Do not support this crass commercialisation of spirituality,prophecy and the desire for transcendence.I'd call him McKenna lite but that would be an insult to Terence.READ ALL ABOUT THE PARADIGM GRIFT OF THE NEW MILLENIA![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self importance defined...","review":"Can this guy get over himself?

Granted, I gave up after half way through, but as others have mentioned, the seemingly randomness of the story telling was off putting. Plus, the use of 'over complicated' language made me feel that if I didn't understand what he was talking about, I was stupid.He is certainly a very smart guy...the other problem is that he has no problem promoting that fact.

While I read some fascinating insight into certain beliefs and/or interpretations of the Mayan calendar system, what I mostle got was the stories of the author's use of psychedelic drugs.While some of the material here is very informative and thought provoking, this is much more the tale of the author's own drugged out journey to what he feels is his own enlightenment.From stories about speaking with shamanistic gods, to being taunted by \\"daimons\\", there is far too much selfish writing in this book, and it honestly takes away from Pinchbeck's credibility. After a while you get tired of reading about yet another trip the author was on and what it meant to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"2012 has little to do with the year 2012. Instead, this book is all about Daniel Pinchbeck's arrogant view of the world around him and his intolerance for people who believe in God (which last time I checked included over 90% of Americans.) For four chapters I wasted my time reading about his psychedelic research (they have a name for this - it's called drug addiction - get help!!) and his self proclaimed superior intellect. At one point he even claimed to be the only person capable of interpreting the happenings around 2012.Don't waste your time!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego trip","review":"Admittedly, I have only read about 30 pages of this book, and will likely not read any more.The first thing that came to my mind while reading this book is that it was all about Pinchbeck and his ego, as another reviewer, vw, mentions. It's a self-indulgent ego trip. Hoping to get to some meat, I flipped through the pages and on every page the most frequently used words are \\"me\\" and \\"I.\\" I was hoping for a little insight, some sort of connection between the theories out there to this whole 2012 mystery. The only things I've learned are that Pinchbeck's parents were atheists, his father was an artist, his mother a Beatnik writer, he grew up in Manhattan, and he has a disdain for anything not liberal. His political views obscure anything that might be sensible. My guess is that Pinchbeck wanted to write a book about himself and slapped 2012 on the cover to sell it.I bought this book at a book store, but wish I had checked it more carefully on Amazon first.

This book is about Pinchbeck's personal life (particularly how he is unfaithful to his partner, doesn't feel loved by any woman, and how women have screwed him over his whole life), various conspiracy theories, and him traveling the world taking various drugs. At the end of the book, after getting pretty much everything wrong about Maya and Maya culture, he proclaims himself to be the return of Quetzalcoatl (an Aztec deity, FYI). Sorry to spoil the ending, but if you want to waste time and money reading a 400 page whack jobs rantings and a 10 page \\"message\\" from Quetzalcoatl, go ahead.

HIs discussion of alien phenomenon was just too hard to digest and I had to stop. If you're a die-hard Pinchbeck fan and you really believe in the notion of UFO's, the supernatural, magical crop circles and stuff like that, you'll love this book.Also, my mother-in-law read this and had to stop about 2/3 in because of some very anti-feminist rhetoric featured in the book. Apparently Pinchbeck is a bit of a sexist. Or so she felt by his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not about 2012","review":"It's all about the author and his wild experiences tripping on shrooms in the Amazon and hating the chicks who dumped him.

The author's indiscriminate use of these agents and his inability to construct a coherent sentence appear, by the book's end, to be causally related. The text conveys nothing so vividly as it does the melting of the writer's own mind, as he downs every indigenous hallucinatory substance he can lay his hands on, coats the page in a nauseously indulgent \\"philosophizing\\" that would shame a freshman, and proclaims himself a visionary and enlightened soul.

I agree that there are things going on that we do not understand. I do agree that something will happen in 2012 as far astrological alignments are concerned. Whether or not they are for the good or bad. That is to be determined. I personally think this author has done too much acid. This book as nothing really to do with Quetzalcoatl at all. He talks primarily about crop circles and his relationship with his childs mother going down the drain due to drugs. I think this book is his own healing process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"The author gets a last laugh - I made you look! - from a hollow charisma that will never find what it is seeking. A quantum romanticism trapped in a Manhattan epistemology never to be the love, just a lover - always the helper, but not the help - the director, but not a direction. Poor soul needed to share his confused onanistic musings via the Y2K continuum. Minutes in a book store left me shaking my head that such a nice cover graphic got wasted on such fear induced drivel.

After 100 pages I still couldn't tell what it was about. Each chapter delved into something new: telepathy, 9-11, crop circles, etc. It seemed like stage-setting for some grand theory but I just ran out of patience. I wanted to have some idea where it was all going. Instead of being dazzled and impressed by the breadth of subject matter, it all seemed really superficial to me.

Unfortunately, until the author is more kindly disposed toward his readers, his work is simply too inaccessible. I wish and hope that some generous editor or friend could step to the plate and help him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thick thinker, intriguing","review":"This is a very interesting book, but people looking for an easy read with simply-constructed theses should look elsewhere. Pinchbeck approaches his writing as serious science and the text is thick with philosophy, psychology and more.The theories advanced by Pinchbeck are mostly collected theories of others who came before him, enhanced by his own experiences with psychodelics. Some of it will be scoffed at by people who have made up their minds about the way things are and Pinchbeck both acknowledges this and expects it.Early in the book, he turns these people on their heads and sweeps them aside, inviting the curious and those readers with a will to think about things beyond the way they have been explained, beyond the way we are most comfortable with, to read on.Do I buy what Pinchbeck is selling? Some of it, sure. Some of it seems a stretch, but some of it is intriguing.

Not recommended for those looking for Mayan prophecy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not 2012. It is 1960","review":"I am not here to tell you if this is a good or a bad book.

I originally received the book on loan from a friend, then myself loaned the book out and have not seen it since, so I am about to purchase it for the first time.

I've listened to other books on tape in abridged form and usually, you might notice an inconsistency once or twice at the most. This version however, was just too abridged. Based on what I heard, I thought this is probably a wonderful book in its full form. But you couldn't get a sense of the characters from this version and some characters, you never even heard from until the end. It was wierd, choppy...made little sense.I can't recommend the unabridged text but I bet I would love it and would recommend it if I read it. I won't recommend this version however.

It never became clear.

The people were unpleasant, shallow and drawn with cartoonish simplicity. The story hopped from decade to decade and was not well developed in any decade. The characters did not speak as much as they were described and the use of drippy, syrupy, damp, shimmering adjectives was cloying at best.

I was thrilled when I found this for $23. It has 'everything recorded with the Upsetters', but seems to be missing a good vocal version of Duppy Conqueror, which appears on the Songs of Freedom box set. It does get a bit tiresome to hear the same song 5 times in a row (because of alternate & dub mixes) but is still worth it if you like great reggae music.

Wilson (and all of the broadcast towers), so it would normally be a no-brainer to get great OTA signals. Our problem is a giant condo complex dwarfing our little house, and blocking direct signals from the towers.In theory, you don't need a unidirectional antenna in L.A., but this one works very well for us! After a test in the attic didn't go well, we mounted it outside (on the post that used to support the Dish!). It pulls in an average of 70% per station, with the exception of one PBS station, and CBS at night. We hooked up a Winegard signal booster, not only because of the condo building, but the TiVo Premiere we use doesn't have the strongest OTA tuner. The booster really helped out, and we have no noticeable signal loss on nearly all the channels (the PBS still has artifacts in the late morning, but it's much better).This was a good antenna for us -- good bye, Dish! Hello, extra $850 a year!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For me, no better than rabbit ears","review":"I was astonished that this antenna performed no better, and for some channels a bit worse, than the stock rabbit ears. I ended up returning it. Now, I understand there are a lot of great reviews, and it could just be my setup, but I would suggest you do as I did and test this side by side with your standard antenna. I am a handy guy, and did not assemble it improperly, as the company notes most unhappy customers do. My setup is indoors, in a big city. It may well be that it is superior if you are in a different situation. I tested it on all available channels, both analog and digital, turning the antenna in every possible direction. In no case did this work better than the rabbit ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice antenna","review":"I researched this antenna thoroughly and decided it would work in my attic. Once I received it I was very skeptical and thought it was too small to pick up all the signals I wanted. I tried it any way and to my surprise it not only picked up signals within it's specified range, but also far beyond it's range from inside my attic!This is a great antenna, but as with any antenna, your milage may very. I would not guarantee nor expect any antenna to outperform it's specifications, but in this case it most certainly did just that. If you need an antenna for digital over-the-air broadcast and the towers are in range of this antenna you will love this one. It's small, light, high quality and a great performer.Amazon had the best price on this at the time I wrote this review too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well","review":"I am from downtown Philly area and I think having this antenna is the best option to avoid spending tons of money on monthly cable subscription. It scanned about 30+ OTA channels for my HDTV and the picture and signal quality is the best. I am very happy!One note though: The antenna does NOT come with coaxial cable. I had to buy a $11 6-feet coax cable from Radio Shack, so you may want to combine your purchase on Amazon with a coax cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, only is missing parts.","review":"Just received the antenna, only it is missing a part - a large 4inch bolt that is supposed to hold the element in the middle. There are supposed to be 2 bolts each 4 inch long , only I have only one... I wonder if this was a return, otherwise I cannot explain the missing part. Anyhow I installed the antenna the way it is in order to test the reception. Works well, only I get a blurr from time to time when the wind blows ( I suspect it is the missing bolt issue). So until I get one I cannot say for sure that it is a good choice for me. I live in the San Francisco Bay area - and I am pretty close to the transmitters - I am supposed to get a yellow type of antenna. Otherwise the antenna looks pretty well made.

I even lost PBS, which is on VHF, and this is a UHF-only antenna. I want my Nova!The good: It's getting all of the TV stations the Radio Shack rabbit ears did. However, I'm getting them with only having to make minor adjustments compared to the rabbit ears. Also, I might be able to combine the Radio Shack antenna with it to get PBS. The picture quality is excellent.It's smaller than what it looks like on this page. It's also about 6 inches front to back. It's small, but bulky, but you can find places to hide it indoors"},{"rating":"2","title":"small footptint - big gain","review":"I was looking for a small antenna to get off the air reception of many local digital channels in conjunction with my new HD Satelite TV service. From my old Satelite dish, I was able to mount the DB2 antenna and use the existing coax cable. The reception gain is enough to lock onto the nearly 40 mile away signals consistently. The gain may be better if I had a taller j-mount. The build of the Antenna Direct DB2 is solid. It's mostly metal and little plastic that is subject to decomposition. I just did a final tune yesterday and see just small oxidation on the mounting bracket, but not the antenna itself. The Antenna Direct brand is worth a few dollars more than the other comparable model."},{"rating":"2","title":"great antenna that works indoor","review":"I bought this antenna after reading many of the positive reviews, including those from people using it indoor. Previously I used a rabbit ear antenna and was able to receive all the basic channels here in NW Austin: FOX, PBS, NBC, ABC, CBS, and CW (9 including sub-channels). Signal strength was good most of the time, occasional pixelated images, but the antenna had to be fully extended and was very unsightly. To solve this problem I installed this antenna in the master bedroom closet right above the cable distribution box (mounted it flat against the wall). The reception has improved; I can still receive all the same network channels plus a couple of new Spanish channels. This is pretty good considering the less than optimal install: indoor, first floor, not facing stations. I can't say anything bad about this product other than the photos in the instructions don't appear to match the actual product. Fortunately it's a piece of cake to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reception in my basement when no other antenna worked","review":"This antenna has worked in my basement when no other antenna would. I live equally 30 miles between two major TV markets and I can pick-up stations from both cities in my basement. Ultimately, I moved this antenna outdoors and I receive 90-95% reception strength for the signals that I have pointed my antenna at and 70-80% reception stength from the signals that my attenna is not facing.This is intended to be an ourdoor antenna but the size is small enough to hide behind a TV or entertainment console with little trouble.I highly recommend this antenna!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly design, poor reception","review":"I had to return the antenna because it is not different than the cheapest model in the market.

I was paying for local channels only. When I got a HiDef TV and cable did not provide HiDef local channels without a big bloated package, I went for the antenna. I tried two brands of indoor antennas with very poor results. I live in an urban city, 7 miles from all the antennas and my home is brick. After failing with the two indoor antennas, I decided to try this one. However, I did not want to hang the antenna outside. Luckily, I have an entertainment system that allows me to set this outdoor antenna behind it. I have a splitter cable running the signal to two TVs. The outcome is phenomenal. The indoor antennas did well for a couple channels, but this DB2 antenna gets them all and at great quality. It is well worth the extra money beyond the cost of the indoor antenna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Terk HDTVa","review":"I was pleasantly surprised when I hooked up DB2 to my TV and got much better signal compared to Terk HDTVa. Unlike the Terk, DB2 does not need external power, which is great since Terk amp unit stopped working for me after a few month. After going through that couple of times, I finally got fed up and decided to get a new antenna. I got DB2 after reading all the positive reviews, and I cannot be happier with the purchase!It was a breeze to set up. We live on 5th floor of 8 story loft, facing inside the building, but it has no problem picking up signals. And antenna is not even placed near the window.Only minus is that it did not come with antenna cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well for Digital Broadcasts - Even Indoors","review":"I was skeptical that I could use this antenna indoors, but it actually works well.

However check out the Channel Master CM-4220 which sells for less and should perform just as well. Or the Eagle Aspen Dtv2Buhf which appears to be identical to this one and also sells for less.If space is not an issue you might also consider the CM-4221 or CM-4228 which are bigger and more powerful, providing more bang for the buck.The DB2 is a fine performer but in my opinion is a bit overpriced compared to the alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointed in this product","review":"I recently bought this antenna thinking that it would pull in more stations than my 12 inch whip antenna.

I'm currently using it indoors under a metal roof with good to excellent results. I was using a Silver sensor indoor antenna that is in my opinion, the best pure indoor antenna and I would grade the performance of the DB2 as roughly double based on instance of image instability and periods of dropout. The DB2 is intended as an outdoor antenna but is about 1' x 2' in size, 6\\" deep - small enough to get by inside if aesthetics are not an issue. I have mine hidden in the top of a closet. If I were going to hang it outside, I would have chosen a DB4 or a Channel master 4221.

I canceled my satellite TV service (saving myself 100+/month & 1200+/year).I climbed up on my roof, used this product's bracket to mount it to my old satellite, and then just unscrewed the cable from the satellite and screwed it onto the DB2 antenna here. That made it easy to tune in my TV and watch about 10 local channels. I will say the reason I don't rate this product a five is basically reception, that may not be the fault of the product though. About half of the channels come in almost seamlessly, the other half tend to lose reception pretty often (especially in bad weather).Overall, for the price you can't really beat the deal here. Saved me a fortune over the past couple years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked OK","review":"I was in the basement and used an old indoor antenna. I received about 4 of 6 channels.

I then put the DB2 about 9 feet above the roof peak, now I get all of the channels with 100% signal level. Of course, there is a giant metal building next door and the high placement may have provided for a direct signal without metal in the way.

It would find the local channels but it would not hold all of them even though the manufacturer's web page rates its range at \\"1-30 miles\\". Amazon.com kindly took it back and we purchased its larger brother instead,Antennas Direct DB4 Multi-Directional HDTV Antenna, which the manufacturer rates at \\"up to 55 miles\\" and even fits on the same mount,Antennas Direct 30 Inch Universal J-Mount for Antenna Mounting STM-715. The DB4 is basically two DB2s mounted vertically over each other. The larger capture area did the trick. We had initiall paid just shy of $35 for the DB2 and then paid only $6 more, about $41, for the DB4. That extra $6 buys a lot more coverage."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ANTENNA","review":"I bought a digital converter and hooked it up to my wire/bowtie antenna and it was a nightmare.

Because of it's small size, it's being used as an indoor antenna and has been rated as the best indoor HD antenna. According to the website that gives you distances from where you live to the nearest broadcasting towers, I'm 14 miles away from most of them. I hung it in my window (which was the best location after moving it around) and am receiving every HD station (NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, WOR, PIX plus their digital extra stations like weather)in my area except for the PBS one. It's multi-directional and doesn't need to be re-aimed for different stations. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that it is sensitive to people movement. Many indoor antennas are. However, it can be more annoying with HD. Unlike analog stations where you get static, it's all or nothing with HD reception. You get good reception (no static) or none (or digital breakup).

It does not have a mount so you will have to make your own homemade mount (we used a stack of boxes and an egg crate to stick it in so it will sit up). It has a great ability to pick up UHF digital channels, and its Multi-Directional attribute works well here. However, it is much more sensitive to VHF. If you turn the antenna away from the direction of the VHF tower (digital Ch. 11 in my area) we lose reception. Studies have shown that UHF antennas do not have good gain in the VHF spectrum, even if they claim they do. So in order for us to pick up that channel we have to rotate it slightly toward the northeast. No biggy, but anyone buying this product needs to know.

I receive all 14 of the available digital stations using it with an RCA DTA800 Converter Box. I did try the Tivax Brand and the Apex Brand Converter boxes as well and was only able to pick up half the channels with a grainy picture and a slight hissing noise. The converter boxes make all the difference. RCA Brand is crystal clear with big easy buttons on the remote that controls both the tv and the converter box.

If you want heavy duty I would suggest trying the UR185L model instead. I imagine this piece would be great in a kitchen or basement for extra storage of light items (DVDs, etc). For heavy tools and bins (such as in a garage) I would think you might want to consider something stronger. In my opinion I would much quicker spend $26 on this than $50 on a plastic unit.

There is nothing to drill through for the second hole. You can drill a second hole for some of the shelves. Even when the two holes match up, you need to go to a hardware store to get longer bolts to get completely through the two holes to put a nut on. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time for assembly REALLY not worth the money you save","review":"I want to start off by saying that these shelves could be awesome.

The recorder has one tiny, tiny button in the middle that does everything or if you aren't good with it it does nothing you ask it to do. I can not even find out how to turn it off so I have to take the batteries out each time and then re-insert them. I would throw it out the window but am afraid I might hit someone and get sued.

In particular it enabled me to claim my own authority in relationship to my parents. Williamson's theory is that it is essential to find a way of eliminating the inter-generational hierarchical boundary that is created in the parent-child relationship in order to fully develop our sense of personal authority. The goal is to find a means to begin to relate with parents as peers once we have attained adulthood. When this is accomplished, paradoxically the intimacy deepens as this new relationship develops."},{"rating":"2","title":"best pole pruner I've owned","review":"This lopper is superb, cutting faster than I ever expect, but the saw has been pretty awful!

The chapters seem to repeat over and over the vague generalites and platitudes of problems or potential problems in global commerce. If you find it insightful for an author to repeat over and over in various forms that some companies are becomming global and must consider the implications of language and cultural differences between nations when entering into foreign markets then you will love this book.

However, it's NOT for the general reader---or even the above-general reader. I have tried several times to slug through the dry text which was obviously written to impress academia and the author himself. Even with a reasonbly high I.Q. and an advanced degree, I had trouble staying interested and understanding the material. There is little doubt this author is an expert in this subject; however, he missed a good opportunity to get the rest of us interested and to impart in a readable and understandable way the obviously vast knowledge which he holds.

H.P.

You should learn how to recognize them and deafeat them, then you'll begin to listen to the voice of silence which is the voice of your inner master. Second lesson teaches us about two different paths: heart one and eye one. Third and last lesson is about seven gates to Nirvana and describes us the weapons we should gather or create before fighting dangers we will encounter at each gate. But main lesson is that we should never give up.

If you are looking at getting this single I would also be sure to check out their album \\"Make Believe\\".

I was a bit dissappointed when I heard the first single \\"Beverly Hills\\" off their new album until it was made blatantly clear (by listening to the lyrics and reading a number of Cuomo's interviews) that the song is a satire for how Cuomo has always felt he doesn't fit in with the Hollywood crowd. I guess you have to be a long time Weezer fan to understand something of the guy. They definetely have not sold out.I gave it four stars because of \\"butterfly,\\" that's my least favorite Weezer song and it was not improved in this CD.\\"Island In the Sun\\" it's a lot of fun and sounds great live.

The patterns are fun to choose from. I didn't try to mix and match yet, so didn't have an issue with square sizes when combining them. However, I did have an issue that options weren't given for smaller size afghans - lap size. You have to make your own call on how many squares to do (and which ones) to make a smaller size blanket. Additionally, I used needles larger than recommended for slightly larger squares that have worked out nicely. I made the \\"Flower Power\\" afghan in 6 bright colors - mixed and matched for the stripes and flowers and did one solid of each color. The larger needles made the squares approximately 10 inches each. I am very happy with my results and am looking forward to starting another one. I will, however (thanks to another review) be careful to watch that my squares are the same size if I mix patterns."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"My classmates and I voted on this book because it seemed very interesting. As I began reading chapter after chapter, everything started to get confusing. There would be times in this book where the story would just stop and jump into another story, such as unnecessary letters. The book did not stay right on point with its story about Hanssen being a spy. As the story got into the Opus Dei's \\"religion\\" or their beliefs, I asked my self WHAT does this have to do with beig a SPY? I do not recommend this book to anybody. It's not a steady pace book."},{"rating":"1","title":"REFUND!!!!!!!","review":"This book was the opposite of what I expected it to be. I thought it was going to be interesting, but I was totally wrong.Those letters threw me off completely. At one point it would be telling a story and then there would be a letter he wrote to the ussians. Maybe the author didn't think about the sequence before writing the book. Thats why I believe this book was a rushed job."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Reader Who Stayed Out In The Cold","review":"The book is great tool for beginner writers that are looking for a good example of a RUSHED job. This book best describes itself as the Adrian Havill's collection of interviews and newspaper articles of Robert Hanssen's case. It is a tedious and tiring piece. The author often diverts the readers from its main idea with endless letters and unnecessary details. The way he describes the Foxtone Park with all the animals and bushes and little roads, drove my attention way. The editing of this book threw me off. I had to stop and read over and over again until be able to group the main idea with the information provided. The author's psychological opinion about Hanssen's behavior, the interviews with Bob's relatives, the encoded letters from the Russians it's all blended together in a mediocre editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"It was a struggle to get through this book. It was confusing because I had to jumped back and forth between Havill's writings and his overloaded clips of Hanssen's letters to the Russians. Havill also included too much unnecessary information such as the Opus Dei. He had a whole chapter on this and it was really boring. It didn't really had much to do with Hanssen's spy life. This book lacks good organization skills and clarity. He could have taken more time and carefully plan the book. I believe that if he spent more time instead of rushing the book out, he would have done a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't bother reading this book. It is the same thing over and over and over, so that it makes one want to scream. The movie \\"Breach\\" is not the true story either. It's Hollywood. Read David Wise's book, the best of the bunch written about spy Robert Hanssen. Hanssen was a brilliant if not troubled non agent who wanted to be the real deal. So instead of getting to be an FBI operative, he went to the dark side and made himself a name giving up our country's secrets that may never be recovered. It is enough to scare you to death and make you ill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spy Games","review":"This book was interesting and an easy ready but contained a great deal of information already printed/broadcasted in CNN, ABCnews or Washington Post. A few interviews with Hanssen's friends and old college buddies seemed to be the only new information in the book. Basically, if you know anything about this case, you don't need to read the book. Much of the new information is Opus Dei chatter and discussions of rabbit mating patterns in the parks of Vienna Virginia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves Much To Be Desired","review":"I was sorely disappointed in this book. The writing style was choppy and Havill's presentation of his findings lacked a comprehensive exploration. Havill's research seems to mirror the same information available from the first news coverage which still leaves many questions in the mind of the reader. At best this book serves as an expensive beverage coaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut and Paste","review":"Another example of an author trying to capture the moment by rushing to the market with the \\"inside story\\". The book was a disappointment since all it did was gather public information and lay it out in an orderly fashion. No insights into the man and his possible motivation for betraying his country, his wife, and his family. In order to fill out the book, we get explorations of Opus Dei, exact reproductions of every letter sent between the Russians and Hanssen and pictures of his old high school, houses, and a group photo from the State Department. No pictures of his wife, children, or other family members. No details of the internal life of the Hanssen family when Robert was a boy. What was the relationship between Hanssen and the father, which I have read about in the press but not in the book. Possibly the book was already in galley proof before this information became available. Buy the book that is on the best seller list if you want to read about this tragic figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"It was a struggle to get through this book. The author clearly threw this together to get the book out there quickly. His references to various characters keep changing and it is often unclear what person is being discussed. The book contains large sections of Hanssen's overwraught, boring letters to the Russians, cut and pasted in the book in long format by the author. The author diverts us from the main story with a strangely inapplicable discussion of Catholic \\"cults\\". Note: recent events detailing Hanssen's sexual proclivities (not the stripper stories discussed in the book, but taping of he and his wife, voyeurism, etc.) cause the author to have egg on his face. The author's adamant opinion is that Hanssen was straight as an arrow despite his relationship with a stripper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hanssen Is Despicable","review":"I've read this book twice. The first was for the sheer pleasure of reading a well-written book that pulled me along--it's a real page-turner. I went back and went through it again in order to absorb the dense information. The author puts our electronic surveillance systems like echelon and carnivore in layman's language and his chapter on Opus Dei is illuminating while even-handedHanssen betrayed his country--we all know that, and as the author makes clear, he is at best, mentally unbalanced. On the other hand, there's little doubt he knew right from wrong and so in the final analysis, he has to be considered a despicable traitor to America. What he did is as bad as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"This poster is more darling in person!

The artist is a complete pro and is a wonderful painter and teacher. The DVD has three sections all of which are very important you watch. The section without the commentary is in and of itself a seperate visual lesson, where one can just sit back and enjoy watching the master. You have to listen to the section that says \\"With Commentary\\" to recieve verbal instruction in the way of a discourse between artist and students, this is a highly informative disscusion. Then in section three under \\"Tools\\" you have the the artist talking about the brushes and colors he used. In all this DVD is the best out there on the market. Marco Bronzini is in the true sense of the word a real Professional and wonderful teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is undoubtedly the worst art instructional video I have ever seen. There is no dialogue to explain what is going on, the hand-held camera work is extremely jittery, there is nothing except quick views of a fast-moving brush slapping paint on a canvas.

There aren't really any bad songs here but some standouts are Ride of your life, (I feel)Down, Said She, All my friends crush you, and I like It(one Way)Kelly, the lead singer has a voice reminescent of Layne Staley and the band kind of remind me of Alice in Chains but you would never confuse the two bands.

For the number of pages, I would have preferred fewer songs and complete lyrics.Also, there are way more chord changes than any guitar player I know would use or than I have ever heard in a song.

I HIGHLY recommend this album if you are a fan of \\"Rock Opera\\" style musical albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising!","review":"I bought the AMT NightStorm, expecting a high-grade optical device, but as it turns out I received a very poor piece of equipment.

It's not going to make podcast-quality sound files, or even upload into your computer, but it does exactly what it says it will -- it records interviews with good enough clarity to transcribe later. I used this recently to do an interview with a soft-spoken guy at a crowded party, and the recording came out just fine. There was background noise, but he was perfectly audible. In my experience, this is a bargain digital recorder that's of solid, reliable quality. It's not a top-of-the-line model, but it is perfect for my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for recording singing","review":"I bought this product to record my voice lessons and practice. The sound quality of recordings would suffice for speech alone, but is not sufficient for singing.

Plus, it's made out of the cheapest plastic in existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This should be one of those Infomercials where they sell it for 14.95 because it is not worth what they are charging for it. If it was offered at 14.95 then maybe it would be. The sound is absolutely horrible. No quality at all even with the mic vol way down. You might use it to record grocery lists or something but it is not much better for anything else. The user manual is not very good either.

I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992. I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit. The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there. The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width. The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992. I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all. What is that old adage? If it's not broke don't fix it. Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it? 991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you.

All it was good for is MP3's since I am six five and have huge monkey hands. Playing a game was impossible, since my hands would cramp and hurt after 10 minutes playing the darn thing. However when I heard of this product I picked it up, (since it was cheap) and figured I'd give it a try. To my delight I found that the PSP charger grip made the PSP more comfortable and didn't make my hands cramp. Sure the PSP is less portable, by in my case it saved my PSP from the pages of ebay. It feels a bit flimsy when you are playing, but it hasn't failed me yet. The extra five hours of play is a huge bonus too. All in all, if you are a large person, I highly recommend this product, it basically turns the uncomfortable PSP into an extremely comfortable PS2 controller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This add on is pretty nice. I have yet to discover how long the add on battery actually lasts, but I'm sure I will soon. The only bad thing about the thing is how the grips will move a little if you try to, making it feel like your PSP is less secure, though, it pretty much is. That's what the other reviewers have been refering to as \\"flimsy\\". If you want an add on battery, I would definately get this, or the power brick."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got one just like with but without the extra battery charger option.","review":"I got a model that looks just like this but made by a different company I believe.

He could probably make a book just for his writings in the future. Once in Darby Jones, but now finally doing his own thing, Lanky is the real deal. Full of substance. About how life goes so fast even though we may progress quite far since our childhoods. About how we couldn't appreciate things before that we can appreciate now. I really felt that one, cause I definitely appreciate struggling artists trying to make it more than I did when I was like eight years old. About where love may lead us and about the letting go of past loves. The album questions taking those risks when you can and working hard to achieve your goals. The album is realistic, yet it leaves a warm feeling of a strong maturity for the real world and appreciation for how people go through life.The 10th track is an instrumental of one of the previous tracks, Careless I believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"m/c riding tips","review":"i really enjoyed reading this book...very informative with tips on long distance riding and equipment. i was impressed with the enormous distance that some riders (male and female) have traveled."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for long distance riding","review":"Greatbook.

Rate the book for what it is; a guide for the beginner and not a college textbook that would cover every last detail of a restaurant operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simplistic","review":"The language is easy to read, but the precious details are few and far between.I expected a lot more for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings tears to my eyes....","review":"I've been listening to the Classics for 50 years as well, and I had to agree with one of the reviewers C. C. Newton of this Album La Boheme, Renata Tebaldi's Mimi and Carlo Bergonzi's Rudolfo about giving one goosebumps, putting a lump in ones throat, bringing tears to one eyes. Especially true of the aria \\"O mio babbino caro\\" sung by Renata Tebaldi.

Especially well-thumbed sections so far: Unix Commands, Bourne and Korn shell, vi (this section alone justifies the purchase of the book), and make.

However, if you're a songwriter/composer like myself, it mainly serves as a good resource to have for web site ideas and some marketing ideas.

Shows both famous folks & little people as very real and living, not as rigid, overdressed Victorians posing for formal portraits in their Sunday best. Packed with facts, but the writing is still smooth and accessible--rare to find both in a history book like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and informative","review":"This book is very well organized and is wonderful to read. It is organized by months during the year 1900 and you are lead through an excellently written journey that takes the reader from Jan 1 to Jan 1. The author has included many interesting historical antecdotes, political stories, and vivid details of what life was like in that important year of 1900. I highly recommmend it to anyone interested in turn of the century books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A magical journey of romance.","review":"Cathy has dreamed of Ash, or the man she thinks of as her mystical warrior.

That is why I gave it 4 stars and not 5. I just wanted time for the characters to talk and connect without the ongoing drama all the time. Yes it makes for a dramatic plot but the constant change of location overtook the romance and it was like - and then- and then- etc, often with no purpose and little reason (I'm being picky).I don't want to end on a downer. So I reiterate- a good book, and that is hard to find in this genra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Fantasy/Romance","review":"Gemini Moon was a good romance with a Fantasy background. I'm usually a skeptic and the story has to be realistic for me to enjoy. This fantasy was well written and the love story was pretty good, yet predictable. I enjoyed the Fantasy World of Tareth more than the love story, the characters had a bit of historical romance feel to it, which I did like very much. The characters were well defined and the story had a good flow. It was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"This book was very entertaining. I enjoyed it very much.

Ms. Hendricks creates a world that draws you in and a plot line that keeps you going. I was most pleased to see her handling of the heroin who is handicaped. While physically weak, she more than makes up for it in guts and strength of will. I can't wait to read more of this series1!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating read","review":"I was unsure if I was going to enjoy this book very early on. As I continued to read, however, I became captivated. I found myself reading at stop lights to find out what might be happening between the main characters, Ash and Cathy. I stayed up late nights just to finish and find out how it all ended. I was more than pleased. I was so involved with this book, it's characters and it's make believe worlds that I never wanted to put it down. I found myself a bit sad when I did finish it. It was a truly romantic and wonderful read that I wish never ended! I laughed, I cried (sobbed), and I lusted! I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bits of imagination amidst the plodding","review":"Good thing this was a free Kindle ebook, because for some reason I thought I was downloading a Science Fiction novel. I should have paid more attention to the reviews- might have noticed that this is actually a 'romance novel'. It's somewhat imaginative but filled with repetitive, often ridiculous, soft-core situations, about one a page. Read this if you love the old-fashioned 'bodice ripper' genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy romance..a fun read","review":"With a spirited female protagonist and sexy male from another parallel world, Gemini Moon is an enjoyable read for those who enjoy romances with a touch of difference.Cathy is a wonderful character, well developed and thought out. Ash, a prince who travels to earth in search of his new wife's \\"ka\\" isn't quite as nicely written...he's quite macho and overtly bossy, but then he is a prince and accustomed to having his own way.The plot primarily is about how or if Cathy is willing or able to release katrinas ka, and the journey (there's always a journey in fantasy books) complete with crystal swords and unusual creatures bring Cathy and Ash closer.The ending is exciting and all the strings of sub plots nicely brought together. No spoilers here.....but if you enjoy the genre, or enjoy romances I'm sure you'll enjoy this.A kindle freebie right now (march 2011)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A hot stone would work better","review":"After ironing clothes since I was 10, I have now experienced the worst iron I've ever used by far. This iron takes an infinity to heat up, the \\"smart\\" steam system that's supposed to sense how much steam you need, is pretty stupid - translate - nothing needs steam unless you shake the iron first. Heavy and cumbersome to use, it really doesn't even remove the wrinkles at the appropriate settings and burns at higher settings. It also spits and stains materials. The angle for water access is also difficult to use. Even when the iron is turned off, it has an annoying ticking sound that I can hear across the room and I'm hard of hearing! I've tried giving it a couple of months and I hate it even more. I would have returned it if I had been smart enough to save the box. I've just ordered a new iron and I won't even give this one to Charity - that would be an insult.."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks so bad, it completely empties itself","review":"I have never had a iron that leaked so bad, I fill it up to use, and it leaks until it is empty on my ironing board.

It was definately cheap, but this iron is very HEAVY. I don't like the large size either. The iron doesn't seem to be put together very well. For instance the water pour hole is very small (you should really save the water cup that comes with it, it's probably the only thing sized correctly to get the water in the hole) and there is a cover over the top. To close the cover it seems like I am going to break it. The dial to turn it on is also very difficult to move. While the iron turns itself off after a certain amount of time of not being used, it switches back on when you move it again. Annoying when you just want to put it away. Basically, I am saying it's cheap, but not cheap enough. My last iron was purchased at WalMart for less than 10 bucks and it was great (until the cord blew out of the socket...). Good luck..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you already know . . .","review":"This is for people who are not already familiar with this kind of software. Don't bother.

She has barely touched it, but I read the whole thing and had a lot of fun doing it. I know nothing about birds, so it is now great that if I see some cute little bird in my backyard, I can grab this book and find out what kind of bird it is, and learn a fact or two about it. I would like it if it had more information in it, some birds have almost nothing written about them. But still, 95% do, and the full-color pictures really help. If you know nothing about northwestern birds, but want to increase your knowledge of them, then I say get the book. It's fun!Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"International Justice","review":"This book is a worthy read for students, scholars, and laymen interested in the complex and ofthen paradoxical arena of international justice.

This woman has the luxury of going off and leaving her husband for a year to find herself. Most of us find ourselves in the loving of others. This poor soul is one lost soul and does not have any wisdom to give. She got a lot from her friend she met at the beach, but she is a pretty shallow, ungrateful person. I feel sorry for the poor husband as she rushes off to give her seminars and women are lining up to fill up the emptiness. My husband died, and I loved every day with him. I only wish I could still have his love and companionship. He helped me to be the person I am. Maybe this woman married for the wrong reason. Love heals, deep love nourishes.

But wait, y'all, Joan inserts this profound observation: Frogs don't jump backward. Yes. Wow, the implications for your life are staggering!

In Tennant's book the species is the subject of a quest told in the form of a passionate, humorous epic with many interesting and informative digressions.

While there is some text that accompanies the forty full color plates which are the highlight of this book, it is merely plate specific. Other than the brief introduction that appears at the beginning, there is really nothing substantive for the reader. It is, in essence, a poster book, as it devoid of any meaningful text.

There's a lot of realism about vampires in there, although a bit different from Anne Rice. I didn't quite buy the way he explains the vampire's history. Oh and there was far too much about riverboats. In fact, it should of been called, \\"A Tutorial on Riverboats, with some vampire murder stuff to make it interesting.\\"I didn't quite relate to any of the characters, and some were racist, to the point of being overly so. I see some of Fire and Ice stuff in here: lots of characters, nothing happy, lots of death.

Yes it is a graphic novel. That means comic book or in archaic terms, \\"funnybook\\". Mr. Martin has written many lovely books besides the amazing A Song of Ice and of Fire series and this is one of them.

After finishing the most recent I made exhausting attempts to find more spellbinding heart gripping novels. After a few frustrating disappointments, I made the return journey to some of Martin's earlier works.Fevre Dream. I approached with cautious skepticism given the content (not a big vampire lore fan.) I was immediately captured. Martin creates and develops a beautiful world, larger than life characters and a storyline that keeps you flipping page after page.Though not completely gripping and incredible as his most recent works, Fevre Dream does not disappoint! Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't enthralled.","review":"I really wanted this book to blow me away. Perhaps it's because I was first exposed to George R. R. Martin through his series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" and was entranced entirely by the story and the characters. I suppose I expected the same caliber of work from all of his novels. \\"Fevre Dream\\" didn't live up to my expectations, sadly. It had the potential to be a very original and interesting take on classic vampire literature and lore, but I never felt as though the story flowed smoothly, nor did I feel any sort of connection to the characters. The entire book seemed rather flat and one-dimensional, with catalysts that felt forced rather than being natural progessions in the story. All-in-all, I was left feeling let down after finishing this novel, especially after paying $12 for it. I'd say stick with \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" for your George R. R.

It is worth your time and you will know it for sure, at the end. I hated returning the book to my friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention GRRM Fans","review":"The book on this page is a graphic novel. Apparently from some other reviews this is not clear enough from the description. If you are looking to purchase this book based solely on your interest in George R. R. Martin, I would heartily recommend that you read the actual full length novel first:Fevre Dream.The book on this page, and the subject of this review, is a collection of the series of comic books based on Martin's novel. As such, it is put together quite nicely, with thick glossy pages, and bound nicely. The Signature Edition, limited to 1000 copies, features a simple autograph in black marker by the auther. I give it four stars because for what it is, I do consider it a bit over-priced. Who knows though, if they decide to make a movie out of this story it may be worth something someday.To sum up: read the original book first, then if you're interested in seeing it interpreted in graphic art, pick this one up as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin's genious brings vampires to life","review":"I admire Martin's work, but I'm not a Horror fan, so I was skeptical when I opened the book at the book shop. after two pages, I wasn't skeptical. after 5, I was ashamed of my doubts. Martin tells a brilliant, strong and powerful tale, and tells it extreamly well.The only problme is that the first one hundred fifty pages are kinde' slow... but it picks up and is alot of fun. The ending was very touching.Don't miss Martin's greatest creation, A Song of Ice and Fire"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin's quality as a writer shines through.","review":"I'm like many readers who know George R.R. Martin from his fantasy books. I think he's one of the best fantasy writers currently active-- the series Song of Ice and Fire is one of the best going at the moment. I picked this book up because I was curious to see what his take would be on vampires, and while I don't find that it has all the strength of his fantasy novels (_Fevre Dream_ is a very early novel for Martin) it still doesn't disappoint._Fevre Dream_ is a historical novel, set in the grand days of the Mississippi steamboat captains. The experienced but unlucky captain Marsh takes a strange business partner-- Joshua York. York is an intelligent book-reading man who has the unusual habit of sleeping by day.Anticipates the better-known Rice vampire novels in the idea of a vampire at war with its own nature. _Fevre Dream_ is intelligent and well-written-- well worth reading for both established Martin fans and fans of the vampire novel in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and quick read","review":"George Martin is an excellent writer, and he makes the riverboats and Mississippi interesting and fun to read. Not an in depth read like GOT, but good summertime reading if you like vampire stories, in an interesting setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable","review":"It's been a very long time since I took the time to write a book review. I decided to offer this one because of many of the comments already made. The novel is exactly as people have said: It sticks with you. I read it at least ten years ago, then my copy vanished. That's bizarre, for me, seeing as I have almost every book I have purchased since I was in grade school.And yet I remember it clearly. Clear enough to be researching it once again, looking for another copy and some info on the author.It's a page turner. One of those books \\"you can't put down\\". The kind that causes you to yell at people to go away if they interrupt you. The characters become people you know, and the ending is as haunting as any I have read. It's an ending that comes too soon and leaves you wanting more. I hope that the author is indeed working on a follow-up. It's a story that definitely deserves it.One of the best vampire novels ever written, and light-years ahead of anything Rice has done on her best day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even those &quot;burned out&quot; on horror will love this book!","review":"Years ago, I read almost exclusively in the &quot;horror&quot; genre, until it (and me) just got tired.A friend recommended this book to me recently, and I was intrigued because she is not a reader of horror fiction generally. To make a long story short, I couldn't put the book down. It is a much more entertaining read than the &quot;Vampire Chronicles.&quot;I was shocked to discover that this title has gone out of print. A fun read for anyone who likes historical adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Martin","review":"A very nicely written book. Those that have read Martin's recent stuff should enjoy. Although the setting is different from Ice and Fire, some elements remain, particularly his humor and penchant for violence and ugly people. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and brutal","review":"I read this book, which I'd bought from Amazon, almost a year ago, and the first thing I can say about it is that it is written in such a manner you would believe you are aboard the Fevre Dream: the language used in conversations and descriptions seems to come from real tape recording of the era. The plot and its development is simple, but the vampire's elegance and brutality, displayed at the same time and with no regard to human manners, makes you feel disturbed. When you get to meet Damon Julian, you'll see what exactly I'm talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I really enjoy George R.R. Martin as a writer. I am a huge fan of his Song of Fire and Ice series, and thought those were the best books ever. This one is better still. I loved the main characters. I loved the river boat. The obsession, the loyalties and motivations. Martin is truly amazing with plot, characters and world building. Every word he writes comes alive for me. I read and I'm there. I see and feel what the characters do. I was thinking, oh god, not more vampires, they are SOOOO over done right now. Not only over done, but dones with cheese and fluff. These vampires are what I expect they'd really be like. No fluff or cheese cardboard here. I cannot think of even one thing I didn't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of fresh air","review":"What an enjoyable read! Although, past indiscretions aside, I could not relate to the amoral ideas, the 'revaluation of values' was refreshing. Despite an early, curious contemptuous barb at Nietzsche in the book, this is his 'Overman' or 'Superman'!I particularly enjoy the scene where Sanin is visited by his sister's subduer and his comrade. I love how Sanin has the courage to say what is exactly on his mind (this in a time when it was completely improper!) regardless of the consequences. It makes you realize how absurd human behavior is insofar as the truth being the last thing anyone is really interested in!You may not agree with the philosophy in this book. I did not always. However, the important thing is to not take literature like this as a destructive promulgation of immorality but rather an open mind to a different view!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my review","review":"I like the way Anne Rivers Siddons executes her plots. They seem so real, it is hard to tell this is a work of fiction.The author has masterfully recreated the life in the south from the 1950's, seen from the eyes of a young boy, belonging to the \\"old\\" southern family. He lives in his house with a \\"foster\\" sister, who ends up influencing his upbringing.Good story, good characters, great places!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a family reunion for me, I cried my heart out.","review":"I was captured from the first line and could not put it down. I was so shocked by the last line that I cried. I was warmed and chilled throughout. I have not been this moved by an author since Pat Conroy. What brilliance. How could this woman have been educated where I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many beautiful words","review":"When a single sentence turns into a full paragraph, there are too many words, even if they are beautiful words. I found myself having to re-read frequently because my mind had wandered. Occasional glimpses of the story line were frustrating when followed by page after page of in-depth descriptions. I was excited about the book but I can't finish it. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Talented Storyteller","review":"After having read several of Siddons' books, I have come to the conclusion that she is a marvelous storyteller. The reader is drawn in. On the other hand, I don't find her books to be very satisfying because her characters are so weak. They never seem to hesitate at making an immoral choice or betraying a friend. They always seem so self-centered. The only Siddons' character I would really like to know is Maude in Colony. There is tremendous talent here, but while I appreciate that good characters must be human, I like to be able to identify with the struggle to be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning achievement!","review":"I grew so attached to all of the characters in this novel, particularly Shep, Lucy and Sarah, that it is truly hard letting go of them now that I have finished. The ending was magnificent - better than I could have predicted. In general, the novel is superb! There was a point towards the beginning where I thought it was too wordy and descriptive, but there was, of course, a reason for every little detail that Siddons incorporates and the characters come to life much more strongly because of this. The dialogue is so rich and realistic that you can imagine each scene as, I hope, Siddons intended us to. This book is now one of my all-time favorites and for anyone who wants to learn about the South, Atlanta in particular, and really about themselves MUST pick up this book. An incredible achievement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOOONG boring setup for a plot that never goes anywhere","review":"The author spent the first half of the book switching between setting up the characters and foreshadowing the rest of the book. She takes long passages to describe places and even events that end up with no bearing on the story.I'm glad to see other reviewers saying that they were disappointed by this book because I bought two Siddons books at the same time. I hope I like the other book better than this one.THE ENDING: I think Shep jumps from the bridge landing safely in the water and then is finally able to have a relationship with Sarah. By reliving (and changing) the day at the bridge so long ago, he's able to symolically free himself of Lucy.

I just finished the book this morning as a matter of fact, and I must say it was worth calling in a paid day off to finish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much same information","review":"I am a big fan of Ann River Siddons but this book was way too long because she kept saying the same things over and over. She spent way too much time on, which I thought was the main character Lucy's, early years. I know these books are fiction, and I have read lots of fiction, but was hard to believe a girl under 10 or 11 would have such an infuence over these older boys. so much so that the book began to get so boring I had to put it down for a few weeks before I could finish it. I will read more books by this author, but will make sure not to buy any of her books with this many pages. By the way buying books on Amazon is so easy,and convenient. Everything is mailed to me right away, and they are just so polite as well as very professional.Lake Home Getta"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic","review":"Love Anne Rivers Siddon stories, can't believe I missed this one written in 1988, could not put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schwiebert's collection of fishing stories.","review":"Schwiebert writes of the total experience of fishing different rivers and streams.

Shirley's voice may (or may not) be as arresting as the reviewer recalls it from the past. I have only to assess what is on this disk. What is here is fabulous. The delicacy of phrasing, the gifted actor's touch, the modulation and intonation of emotion, and a spine-tingling ability to span the vocal spectrum from the grand to the tender and sotto voce, Shirley has created a gem and breathed life into music that, to most 21st century Americans, is long dead. I would strongly recommend this disk to anyone who wants to hear music at the heart and soul of the American spirit, interpreted by Shirley and his accompanist with a soaring of heart and soul that dwells in the same emotional space (euphoric melancholy) that Ken Burns created in \\"The Civil War\\" documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not recommend","review":"The iron worked fine for a couple of weeks, it irons OK, is good weight.

This made me very nervous with children in the room - either they or I could get nailed with a heavy, hot iron if I wasn't holding it.I finally gave up and spent $19 locally for a basic iron.

I seriously almost crashed going down hill on a busy San Francisco street. I would strongly recommend that you just pull off the visor to begin with.

Embellishing cheaply written songs with cheap instrumentation, this is just the kind of album that gets under my nerves for it's lack of conveying the subtle depth it is attempting. Something about the acoustic, intimate songs are just sad..in a compositional way, not emotional. It was only on track 6 (thankfully following with 7) that my head finally shot up, awoken from it's apathetic stupor, to quickly and thankfully confirm why I sometimes appreciate this band- as a third rate mogwai knock off, with perhaps even greater pop chops...It is only in the beginning of that track that it's deep drums and subtle electric strumming make me realize this attempt was a misfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"All In The Family","review":"Being a fan of the Osbourne family's hit show on MTV, I couldn't wait for the accompanying soundtrack. Cleverly padding the album in between each track with choice uncensored show soundbites, it's fun just on that merit alone. The Osbournes own songs are another draw, with Kelly delivering an energetic pop-punk cover of the Madonna classic \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" as the soundtrack's lead single. Ozzy's \\"Dreamer\\" also features and is his current release, a ballad that is shockingly mellow and filled with feeling. Ozzy's classics \\"Crazy Train\\" and \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\" also get play time, next to classic hits by John Lennon, the Kinks, Eric Clapton, and the Cars. Starsailor provide a good live version of their single \\"Good Souls\\" too. The rest of the harder tracks I tend to ignore, as I'm not really a general fan of heavy rock music.

Not to mention the music selection: \\"Dreamer\\", the severely overrated single from the mediocre \\"Down to Earth\\" is here, as is Ozzy's classic \\"Crazy Train\\" and Sabbath's ever more popular \\"Paranoid\\", but we've all heard them before, and they can't save this drink coaster in the making.

The capacity is suitable for a novice, because you may have to make a few batches before learning how to make YOUR beer, and discarding a smaller volume is always less depressing. But do not waste your money on their beer mixes, if taste means anything to you: By using theis concoctions you get some alcoholic liquid that can hardly be called beer. I would recommend that you don't even open the bag that comes with the device.

I have read it numerous times, but I have also seen it played on the stage, and it was unbelievably funny there. This play is actually one of Shakespeare's earliest. The play is a story about doubles, and the confusion that arises from this. Shakespeare protagaonists are a pair of twins, and to complicate things further each twin has an identical twin for a servant. Shakespeare's humour is bawdy as it was expected to be during the Elizabethan age. Some people think this particular play displays farcical humour because the humour is so broad, but I truly enjoyed reading it and seeing it. I think the genius of this particular play is in the deftness of the plot and the fast-paced perfection and timing of its action.

Example: the lion tearing apart what looks like a deer leg. I haven't even read this book to him yet, because though I am ready to explain pooping and even about his new little sister about to come into our house, I am not ready to explain in graphic details the food chain (we do not moo when we eat hamburgers in our house, either).

I would never have purchased this book on my own-- it was unfortunately given to us as a gift. The pictures are downright creepy. My daughter became visibly uncomfortable when looking at the picture of the baby pooping in his diapers. It is not clear whether the baby is crying, happy or in distress.

It poses some simple questions (What does whale poop look like?)which I would have never, ever wondered about previously. So we went and researched for answers.I think the author did a great job with touching the surface of poop (haha!) and allowing people to really think about the fact that every creature does poop and it really varies.

I LOVE A BAER GEE"},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-timer funny picture book","review":"This book probably has 15 sentences and 15 pages. Each sentence saying that this or that poops.The first time you read it (I should say SEE it) you'll really laugh no matter how mature you are. But after, it'll be left under a bed. Good as a joke present, especially for those low budget exchange gifts. Now isn't poop talking fun !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a cliché","review":"I was so excited to buy this book and then read it and found out it was a flop. It is supposed to make kids understand that it's ok to poop because Everyone Poops. But there is no real lesson here. It just shows animals pooping and asks rhetorical questions. (\\"What does whale poop look like?\\" What parent can answer that when a child insists on knowing?!)This book is supposed to be iconic. But after you read it, you'll see that it's just a cliché."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody poops is a humorous and educational experience","review":"For young children, this book is a great resource towards their learning about, well....poop. As a child psychologist, I realize that only through teaching youngsters about such a socially inappropriate topic will they stop joking about it during class, lunch and at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have more hair b/c of this book!!","review":"I was PULLING MY HAIR OUT, trying to figure out how to get our almost 3.5 year to #2 on the potty! I heard about this book from a friend & searched hi & low for it. It's AWESOME! When he read this book w/ us, in the bathroom, he decided if elephants & fish #2'd, it would be OK for him to let it go too! YAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Read!","review":"My husband & I read to our 18-month old as part of his pre-bedtime routine each day. This book is fun to read every time. The illustrations are engaging & the subject matter is entertaining for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best pieces of modern literature.","review":"I just finished reading \\"Everyone Poops\\" and I must say I am impressed. From the first word to the last, I was thoroughly engrossed in the reading expirience. This book is a modern classic for the ages, and a must-read. It's among my favorite books, an instant classic, and one of the best pieces of modern literature available. Get it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"missing pages","review":"Exciting to get this book for my daughter who is ready to potty train and this book was missing some pages. UGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but...","review":"This is a handy book for preschoolers , I'm sure (I got it from a perverted friend at age 15), but I did feel the author was a little gratuitous with the fecal illustrations, even if only for instructional purposes. Whatever turns you on, I guess..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious for Grown-ups, Too","review":"My husband and I first spotted this book in a friend's guest bathroom, perched on the top of the toilet tank. Charming and hilarious, it has been a quotable source of chuckles ever since. You don't need to have kids in potty training to have a good laugh at this adorable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Has Its Uses","review":"As a teacher with 33 years experience (pre-k through high school and even graduate courses for my colleagues) I appreciate an instant hit/life saver of a book when I REALLY need it. This book is simple enough for the very young and of high interest to the primary set. As a low vocabulary, high-interest predictable book it works. The topic may not be your choice, but I have found it of interest right on up through 6th grade. I'll admit there is no plot; it's non-fiction for the emergent reader. (All right, potty humor for the \\"tweens\\", or pre-adolescents.)Yesterday, I reached for a strategy too far with one of my 2nd grade reading groups. (I am a reading specialist K-3.) I needed a book to save the situation with my lowest reader. This was it! Today, I recouped with a great lesson on schema (prior knowledge) and making text-to-self connections!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the bathroom \\"Library\\"","review":"I have a small collection books in my bathroom for laughs, and this is certainly worthwhile! If you need a quick giggle this book never fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed!","review":"This book was recommended to me by a preschool child care provider. My son was terrified of going poop on the toilet and the first few times panicked and cryed, he was so scared. I realized I had never shown him poopy diapers and he didn't know anything about it so the book was perfect. We read the book a few times right away when we got it and now he asks that I read the book to him every time he goes poop. It's simple to read (and memorize) even upside down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very gentle potty humor","review":"I think some of the humor may be lost in the translation, but overall it's a very cute book. What are kids fascinated by? Poop! It's simple, the illustrations are not gross and it opens up great discussions for kids and parents. I would love for them to answer what does Whale poop look like but it did make me look it up - so there is value in that even. =) Not for everyone but very fun for most."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT addition to our \\"potty library!\\"","review":"I bought several books to add to our \\"potty library\\" now that my second kiddo is potty training. He's 2 and gets a BIG kick out of this book! My daughter is 5 and she also loves reading it to him while he's going potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Buy","review":"I bought this for my son for his \\"potty training party day\\" and it has proven to be an excellent buy! He wants to read it every time he sits on the potty! It's a great way to encourage pooping on the potty too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic!! *****!","review":"Instant Classic like I said!I Just stumbled onto this Cd in Itunes..this Cd was dropped in 2003 and I never heard if it 'till now in'06!How could a 5 star cd like this go unnoticed? One of THE best cds I've ever heard,with the likes of Floetry,Eric Roberson,Gerald Levert,Carrol Riddick,Kindred,Jaguar Wright and others combined with smooth grooves and some of the best songwriting, makes for,like I said,an INSTANT CLASSIC!With all of the fluff Cd's coming and going,I feel like I have discovered a diamond in pile of rocks!!! I'm going to order 2 or 3 so I can pass the word! I really hope that in the very near future the media that we have (internet,sat. radio,radio,T.V.)will do a better job a realizing that these artist have a following and a fan base and,while they may never see album sales like Be'yonce and Usher and 50 Cent,there are so many people loving this \\"Neo-Soul\\" sound.and it's a shame that we have to do our own research to find these artists music and other info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute, soft, lovable","review":"This is even cuter than the photo!It's really soft, and cuddly, well made, and the perfect size for the 5-yr. old I gave it to. He loves it! (His 9-yr-old sister loves it, too.

I've had this brand's chocolate truffle and just as good.

Not only is the taste wonderful, but the aroma is out of this world. If you want a drink that will warm the insides, surround you with a heady aroma and satisfy you with a magnificent spicy chocolate flavor this is the cocoa for you. I highly recommend to all cocoa drinkers - I enjoy it year round!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting...","review":"I don't know what the other reviewers were drinking or what alcohol they added to the cocoa, but this is the most disgusting tasting stuff I've ever had. I was expecting it to be spiced with cinnamon or something remotely appetizing but it tasted as if a band-aid had been fermenting in there, even the smell was gross. Wish I could give it less than 1 star and be able to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"how sad","review":"this is not the original album. many songs overlooked then are sought after today and they just aren't on this dumpster collection...how sad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Griffin cover","review":"This is another Motown compilation of old Miracles' tunes from the 60's and early 70's...This small record label needed to include the monster hit \\"Love Machine\\" sung by Billy Griffin to sell it.

The hair in the pic is a little darker and longer on the website. I had to purchase another wig on the day of the event. I was so hoping it would arrive in time. The show had to go on!

It's beautifully produced and very inclusive.It covers all basketry traditions from the various geographical areas in California, looks at differences between and within tribal styles, includes utility as well as art or \\"tourist\\" baskets, discusses baskets by makers both unknown and extremely famous, and it doesn't ignore baskets made by *male* weavers. No tradition is marginalized in favor of another in this work, and that's unusual!What makes this book really great, though, are the mini-interviews with contemporary Native California weavers and other artists (including the late Vivien Hailstone and Harry Fonseca) about the individual pieces reproduced in the book. These people give the reader insights into weaving that would otherwise be missed. It's nice to see a book on Native America where the Indian voice is so fundamentally present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinero perdido","review":"Muuuyyy aburrido y repetitivo.

Imagine yourself anywhere tropical or paradise-like, and this record would be the soundtrack. I just caught these guys live, and it was a very spritual experience. The grooves will get you dancing, and the vocal harmonies border on angelic. Buy this CD if you want some uplifting music but also want to experience a soothing atmosphere or background. It's in French, but don't let that bother you, its the music, harmonies, and incredible groove this record posseses that will keep you playing it for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit surprising, but overall great!","review":"The harmony and acoustic guitar give this album a Carribean sound. This is an excellent example of good fusion. The instruments are modern, but playing with a folk bent and the words are tribal, sung with a modern bent. The whole thing is very good and easy to listen to. Very accessible."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"This has to be the worst poker DVD on the market. The presentations look like they were planned out 5 minutes before taping, and the information given is worthless. If you don't know what your fingers are called (ring finger, index, thumb, etc.), then maybe this DVD is worth it, as the \\"chip trick\\" footage goes into detail on what each finger is called.I think you'll play worse poker after watching this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the first books written on B2B","review":"Very academic book.

I haven't run into any trouble at all. I'm operating on a new, but bottom of the line Dell PC. I'm very pleased with the system functionality. I was especially delighted to see that I could create a slideshow from digital photos and could use transition effects to move from one photo to the next. In addition, I was able to add a soundtrack to the slideshow. Then I was able to burn it to a CD and play it on my DVD. I was very impressed, but perhaps I impress easy. I recommend this software to anyone with at least a basic knowledge of technology. Its great for video movies, stills, incorporating the two, etc. If you still have a VCR and its still blinking \\"12:00\\", you will have to work hard to learn this, for everyone else, its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can't Believe It","review":"Look people i will tell you right of the bat this program does it job.

Sony has done a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works better than any thing else I have tried","review":"I needed a program to make dvd's for my buisness. Bought a new sony computer, then started the program search. This program is my third or fourth, and is the best. The editor is a little complex, I cannot run a lot of features yet.Program loaded easily into xp, the book is more helpful than any other book i recieved with the other softwear.Biggest anoyance is having to use the old program \\"MY DVD\\" to burn, and organize the chapters.This is a medium complex editor, capable of making nice chapters, with text control, and music or/and voice over, and the ability to make a nice front page for the dvd, with music track.Took me three programs to get here.My mother loved the slideshow dvd that I made for her of her Turkey/Greece trip. Perfect way to show her trip to family and friends.Now I can finish shooting video and get my dvd's moved out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of all non-professional video editing","review":"I've created more than a dozen of my home movies with this software. This program has a lot of features for idiot-proof user or even advanced user with croma-key function. Don't get intimidated by looking at the user interface in the beginning. In fact you gain more experience over the time by using it more frequently, then you will realize how easy it is. It has free-MPEG decoder and DVD author programs. I like it very much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful but somewhat complicated","review":"I love this program. It is very powerful and has many neat features. I would not say it is exactly user friendly though. If you are good at learning new programs you will be fine. It does have a very detailed book that comes with it. It does help some. Overall I still like the program and would buy it again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I wish I had not purchased this software. It has many flaws. One, if you have several pictures on your timeline and wish to extend or shorten the play time of that particular picture, you have to edit ALL the pictures after it. Not much fun when you have 50 pictures up there! Pinacle automatically moves surrounding pictures, much easier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its de same software as Video Explosion Deluxe","review":"Dont buy this software, belive me,its the same as Video Explosion Deluxe but with a new name,its incredible that a Brand like Sony had approve this kind of trick,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than a freebie","review":"The product does not work!! It will capture vidio for a few moments and then freezes requiring a reboot to get things straighted out again. I'll never know how bad it is because the support in almost impossible to use unless I want to pay more money (good money after bad as they say).The videomaker that came with my computer works better than this program. It flys in the face of old logic that if you pay for it it must be better. Stay with microsoft or go with Pinnacle and leave the sony alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome editing, disappointing authoring","review":"as an editing program movie studio can't be beat. i am constantly amazed at the feature set, and what is possible to do. it is very stable and never crashes. i rate the editing part of the package (the movie studio software itself) 5 stars. very good value for the money.the dvd authoring is another story. despite the advertisements, authoring is not integrated and is handled by sonic mydvd v4.5, a very limited and disappointing program. that's why i marked the overall package 4 stars.movie studio can almost handle 16:9 editing. all of the needed features for 16:9 are available during the editing process, the only hitch comes when encoding to mpeg-2 in order to create a dvd. this requires a workaround involving a free program called dvdpatcher to set the correct aspect ratio on the mpeg file before authoring. this only takes a second so it isn't a big deal.i honestly think movie studio is the best \\"consumer\\" (under $100) editing program available."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating letters and a indispensible reference","review":"Not only are these letters to Harriet Monroe, William Carlos Williams, Allen Tate, Donald Hall, Robert Frost (and many others) fascinating and entertaining, but the comprehensive index makes it possible to find Stevens' own comments about and explanations of individual poems--for instance, his favorite poem was \\"The Emperor of Ice Cream\\"--and details about the circumstances in which they were composed. Not only does Stevens outline his evolving theory of poetry, he also expresses his opinions about contemporary art, music and more.Readers that enjoy literary correspondence should also see One Art (the letters of Elizabeth Bishop)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It shows real college life","review":"Burning Annie is witty and touching. It ends with an uncertain future for Max, jusy like when we graduated from college. A wonderful chic chick flick. You will watch it at least twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Hall lives","review":"This dark romantic-comedy is probably the best depiction of college life I've seen since Baumbach'sKicking & Screaming. (And, this time, the actors are actually college age!)There are some in-jokes and nods to Woody Allen fans, but even my wife appreciated the movie without having seenAnnie Hallfirst. This is a great film to see for a mellow night when you don't want violent action or gross out comedy. And there probably hasn't been as great of a soundtrack to a low-budget indie film like this since the originalClerks. Well done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably boring picture","review":"I hesitated giving this film a one star rating as I try to save that for films poorly made. But this movie is so consistently dull and uninspired throughout that I had to give it the lowest rating.The story revolves around a college student who thinks \\"Annie Hall\\" is the greatest movie ever made and a bible for relationships. He finally meets a girl who changes his mind. Kind of a weak premise for a movie, but with a perceptive, humorous script played with passion you could make it interesting. Unfortunately this movie lacks all these ingredients and is quite tedious to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged item shipped to me","review":"Still waiting on confirmation of return after sending parcel back.

This picture is featured on the front of \\"On The Sensations Of Tone.\\"Tom's quirky snse of humor is a bit at odds with the music; serious and ultimately beautiful ambient meditations on, of all instruments, tuba, along with some harmonic singing into the tuba practiced by jazz stalwarts like tuba player Bob Stewart.But this CD is totally ambient; a wonderful late night CD with a glass of wine, a CD which will \\"improve\\" and display more detail on a higher quality stereo, a perfect Sunday afternoon CD. It will change your perceptions of the kind of music a tuba is capable of playing. With multitracking, and Tom's incredible technique on the instrument, which has you swearing you are listening to a baritone or at times a tenor sax,this CD is a floating, ambient delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this crappy Synergy Archive Series DVD-R","review":"While I'd give the film something like a 7 out of 10 (For Y'ur Height Only warranting at least an 8.5), I really wouldn't have bothered buying this had I known that it is a DVD-R. I don't know about the quality of the other individual release of The Impossible Kid from Reel Classic Films, but it IS on a pressed DVD in a Martial Arts 50 Pack from Mill Creek, so I might end up shelling out for that...

There is some sort of screeching electrical noise which is made worse when you put headphones in as the electric resistance is actually audible.

But the author leads us down a garden path, with no garden to be seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than it should have been","review":"On the one hand, this is a typical by-the-numbers conspiracy thriller. On the other hand, it manages to avoid several of the more predicatable cliches of the genre, which makes it much more interesting than your typical book of this type. As an added plus, the author totally avoids the didactic overtones and overt lecturing that sank The Da Vinci Code in more than a few places. Throw in an ending that plays out on a more intimate, human scale, rather than focussing on bombast and explosions and you end up with quite an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish It","review":"THE MAGDALENE CIPHER was downright awful. The plot of this book had no momentum, and the characters weren't even the least bit engaging. The conspiracy-laden storyline was also silly and unbelievable. I gave up about halfway through.Hougan has actually written some pretty decent books in the past. My advice is to read the novels he writes under the pseudonym \\"John Case\\" -- most notably THE GENESIS CODE and THE MURDER ARTIST. Those are both excellent thrillers.But THE MAGDALENE CIPHER is just a waste of time. I really regret spending the money for this disaster of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wake me up when it's over","review":"The best authors write about what they know - this gentleman wouldn't know the CIA from the ATF.

I've used the this unit for over 2 months now and it's worked fine and easy to operate once you've read the manual and used it a little. The volume is good as long as there's nothing else blasting in the room. The only thing that's lacking is a Back-Lite in the display screen so that you can see the display in a dimly lit room when your trying to access different functions. That's the only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5, Other then that, I'm happy with it and the price was right. I've also noticed that some of these same units \\"Don't\\" come with a remote control so if that's important to you look closely before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed","review":"Ive owned this radio for six months and im totally unhappy with the design. I dont like the push buttons for volume and other options. Sorry if i seem dopey but still have trouble figuring out how to select radio stations.

The cd player fails to load and the tape deck unexpectedly clicks off after running only a few minutes. Number two boom box actually ate a cassette tape.

The buttons on the player for operating the CD are stiff. The location of the cassette player on the top makes it awkward to insert a cassette.The remote operates well but it is poorly designed. It is shaped like a V with the narrow end toward the holder and it is slippery. I had to tape some waffle type foam to the back so that it would stop slipping out of my hands.

Curiously, the CD's booklet does not offer us any biographical information on these three excellent solo artists.

The drainboard does not angle high enough, or sit high enough where the water should pour, for water to drain. We took measures into our own hands and cut the drain lip of the board off. This gets some water to drain out (if you make sure to pull it over the sink!) but it still pools in the corners. We've put a plastic block about 2 inches high under the rear of the drainer board (carefully balancing the rack and all dishes on top) and the water STILL doesn't drain out of the corners.

The older trays were rubberized and stayed in place.The height of the board along the edge that is supposed to drain water into the sink is too high, and again; the old trays did not have a height. They sat flush with the countertop.I resorted to using a sheet of slip-proof shelf-liner that one can buy on a roll in a kitchen-ware section to keep this Tray in place.I am quite disappointed in RubberMaid for changing their product.

The rest of the products is fine, but my suggestion would be to factor in the cost of a new silverware basket when considering this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the 1 Star Reviews before purchase","review":"Bummed to discover this $16 item drains sideways.

The drainer doesn't drain very well, if at all. Right now, I have the back propped up about an inch so the drainer actually drains. Otherwise, water just sits on it until you manually lift the back up to drain off the water. This is definitely not the same quality as a Rubbermaid drainer I purchased about 2-3 years ago. The plastic is much thinner and not very pliable. Als,o the country where it was manufactured (good ole USA) isn't where it is manufactured now (China). I'm debating on whether or not to return it with the dish drainer portion also. Buyer beware of this one! Shame on Rubbermaid for manufacturing an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodbye good rubber, hello crummy plastic","review":"I tried this thing to replace my old RUBBER drain board, but this one is practically useless: slides around, tippy, too small, too hard, too light, wrong shape, and NOT RUBBER ANYMORE! It's just hard, crummy plastic. Whatever happened to the RUBBER part in Rubbermaid?I tried contacting the company repeatedly to ask why they stopped making the old, superior, RUBBER drain board - and to please bring it back - but they never responded. Maybe they're embarassed. Yeah, right.I found one of the good old ones at a garage sale. Take THAT, \\"Rubbermaid.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"oh dear","review":"Here's why you should never buy a rubber drain board. After a few days the water that settles actually creates black slimy spots on top of the drain board (and especially in between the cracks) and it's VERY hard and annoying to clean off. I have to scrub hard with a brillo pad for several minutes (up to 10 minutes sometimes). This is a nightmare and can easily be fixed by purchasing a plastic one instead, so I recommend going with that. You're probably thinking I'm not draining the water after I put the dishes away. No I am, but if the drain board remains wet and let's say it's raining outside and damp, the water will absorb into the board regardless. Even thoroughly drying the drain board with a towel still has the potential to create those dreaded black marks.Also rubber tends to get weak and tear after a few years of using, whereas plastic won't. This means the sides of the drain board will probably tear eventually. It really is a better alternative to just go with plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap product!","review":"I purchased this drain board as a replacement for an old Rubbermaid that I had......WOW I can not believe how cheap and flimsy this is!!!

I agree with all of the other negative reviews that it collects water and has to be rinsed off every few days. However I just had a new problem that after having this for less than 6 months it's already got some sort of crack or hole in it and it's belting water out all over my floor every time I use it. I was actually on Amazon trying to find a replacement when I came upon it on here and decided to give a bad review. All I have to do is wash dishes for a few minutes and like clockwork my feet are soaked.

They are now too hard (slide around the counter), and drain on the long side as opposed to the short side so that the water goes all over the counter instead of into the sink. Check your sink basin edge, it must be squared with 15.5\\" of straight edge for the drain mat to work properly. Ours has rounded corners so we either need to have the mat protrude 1.5\\" or the water goes all over the counter.Hopw Rubbermaid saved enough money on the new design to replace all the lost customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't really do what you'd expect...","review":"As other reviewers have noted, the big drawback of this drain board is that it doesn't drain... The plastic bows down in the middle causing water to pool there. A little more tilt would let the water drain fine, odd that the designers didn't pick up on this. It also lacks gripping power underneath so you're constantly having to readjust it so the drain edge is over the sink. Poorly designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufficient","review":"This product is insufficient for the intended use.

Cheap, thin plastic, lip on the drain side now is only about and inch in so you have to move the whole board well into your sink area or it spills all over the counter - and that's with an undermount sink.

If a quintessential Romantic-era work doesn't beg to be embellished, I don't know what would.By far the most aggrivating (and damning) aspect of this recording is a low, mysterious humming that follows the punctuation of the orchestra, clearly not produced by an instrument, and especially bad on \\"No. 4 Final. Andantino.\\" Casual listeners may not notice or care, but I find it intolerable. I suspect it is either a player or the conductor himself, unaware of their dubious contribution.I find it hard to believe that the engineers working on a major label, professional quality work wouldn't notice this fatal flaw.

The best thing about it is the Arthur Rackham art-work used on the CD cover and inner booklet.As someone mentioned below, of especial annoyance, even if I had liked the performance, is the extraordinarily irritating 'humming' by Pletnev as he directs the orchestra.

She then became the most successful woman in the world by opening Elvis Presley Enterprises and turning graceland into the top money making site seeing place. She was and still the most awsome and beautiful creature I have ever seen in my entire life. So read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH","review":"Who among us would want to have our image and empire run by our cheating ex spouse? Elvis was no saint, and I don't blame Priscilla for getting out or straying when he wouldn't make love to her. The reasons why he shut her out is what she leaves out of the book. CHILD BRIDE tells a far more accurate version of how Elvis' little experiment with her backfired and he was forced into marriage by Priscilla's step father, who threatened to go public with the nature of their relationship if he didn't seal the deal with the marriage he promised. Elvis was still going to back out until the Colonel put his foot down and made Elvis get on one knee. Some guy that step father is; who would let their 15 year old daughter move in with a movie star? It's like those parents that send their kids to Neverland Ranch hoping for a big pay day. The Bealieu family's exploitation of Elvis has been a sin that continues, and she has seemingly passed her hard feelings along to Lisa Marie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"This book is absolutley amazing and the best part is you know it's fact and not something made up. Ms. Presley did a great job and I know it had to be hard for her. I love Elvis now more than ever because she gave me an insight on how he was not just an icon but most importantly a good, decent man."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor little priscilla-not-","review":"priscilla acts like she was the inasent one. she wwrite's abouthow Elvis cheated on her, she also cheated on him right after she hadLisa marie. She writes about that in her book. She knew what she was getting into when she married Elvis. She had lived with him before for a numerous of years before they married, so i don't pitty her one bit. as far as her keeping the Presley name i think she kept it for her acting coureer. That didn't go to far. I believe she took the easy way out, she left him when he was down. she didn't stand by her man.and for someone that want's to know the real priscilla read the child bride- great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many!","review":"The old saying goes, \\"If you are going to get involved with a musician, be prepared\\". It's not a normal life and no musician ever pretended it was. They have greater temptations and problems than someone with a 9 to 5 job. Priscilla knew what she was getting into, before she got into it, so I have no sympathy for her. Understanding musicians is the key to a happy life with them. Apparently, she was too selfish to care about anyone else but Priscilla and how SHE could benefit. Elvis was no saint, but who among us is? I think Priscilla's bubble was burst when she found out that Elvis was a real human being! How childish can you get?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk and Slanted Opinions","review":"I've read this book and have seen the movie. Believe me, if you get a chance, read \\"Child Bride\\" a fantastic book that will clear up all the pretentiousness of this writing, for it appears that Priscilla has written what she wants everyone to believe. Perhaps she believes her made up stories herself by now. Don't bother wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed product condition","review":"This used paperback novel was advertised as \\"excellent or outstanding condition\\" but was far from that upon receipt.

Over all I came away from this book with the feeling that perhaps about 10 percent of the story is based in fact, with a story built up around that base for self image protection or some sort of self image projection for the public.It's not a bad read at all; it just has the feeling of being about as truthful and honest as a Washington politician. I suppose when it comes to the fantasy world of Hollywood, and Celebrities who are too far removed from the real world, attempting simple honest truth is too difficult of an obstacle to overcome and save face.I would recommend this book for entertainment reading purposes for the most part. As far as an honest and factual story, perhaps that may come with a sequel to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"I have never really been an Elvis fan (persay) but My mother was. I was very young when Elvis passed away, so he really was not an Icon for me. However, my mother had this book and I thought I would give it a try. I started the book at about 9:00 in the morning and I could not put it down. I was finished with the book by 3:00 in the afternoon. I loved reading the fairytale love affair and knowing the secrets behind the love and marriage. This is a must see book for any Elvis fan, and even if you are not a die-hard fan, I would recommend it. It was really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical glossed over celeb bio","review":"I have had a change a heart about this book, if you read it when it first came out in the 80's, you thought it was a great book. But now over 15 years later alot of inconsistencies arise but since Priscilla is Priscilla no one has really ever dared to question her. Alot of people who were interviwed for Child Bride tell a diffrent story, so many that their stories can't be explained away because i have always believed were there is smoke, is fire.In regards to the fact that Priscilla did date quite alot but she says she hardly did and when Priscilla was supposedly giving Elvis encouragment in the TV movie. Another side came about to where she was mocking him, laughing behind his back over the snowmobile suit he was wearing. And on and on, don't buy this book because if you really read it, you will come away with alot more questions then answers. But if you like the usual spin, you will love this one.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis gets chewed up and spit out!","review":"Was Priscilla Presley mad at Elvis when she wrote this book? I think so. She comes off as an angel and makes him look like the devil himself. How could you be married to Elvis Presley and write a book telling the most private things about your marriage? Did we need to know he took pictures of her naked? That he made her and her girlfriend appear to be lesbian lovers as he watched? Wait a minute - which is it? Does she go both ways? What a dishonor to the King of Rock and Roll! This book cannot possibly be the real truth - if you want to read a good book about Elvis & Priscilla - read Child Bride. The ex-Mrs. Presley is not as perfect as her book would have you believe. Poor Elvis!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Priscilla certainly lives a vivid fantasy life in this book...","review":"A piece of TRAILER TRASH WRITTEN by a piece of trailer trash. They'd laugh him right off the stage...Simon Cowell would give him a choice \\"review\\" of his \\"talent\\"....And WHY do you think a guy like Elvis would wait for someone like Priscilla? He didn't wait. He was a babe magnet. He had a whole entourage of woman drooling over him, and he's gonna \\"wait\\" for some 13 year old? Priscilla knew exactly what she needed to do to keep the guy. And it DIDN'T involve Tiddly Winks.. This book is PURE FICTION. If you expect ME or ANYONE ELSE to BELIEVE this garbage, you have some serious problems!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best part of the book is the pictures","review":"I read the first chapter in the bookstore before making the decision to purchase it. I told myself I wasn't going to give Priscilla one red cent if she was negative about Elvis. The first chapter was basically the ONLY chapter in the book where she wasn't painting a bad picture of Elvis. This book infuriated me - I finished it, but regretted purchasing it. The only reason I didn't throw the book away is because of the pictures. Would not recommend to an Elvis fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"a weave of lies....","review":"This book is a weave of lies. How Pisscilla wants fans to believe things. Maybe she is hoping people will forget how things really went. If you divorce him you ain't his widow hunny, much less one who ever really cared about him.

While I am sure there was much omitted, we have a better insight about Elvis, the man, after reading Priscilla's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, a hard book to put down!","review":"A lot of the reviews are negative. I wanted to say I found the book fascinating. Very difficult to put down or walk away from. It depects Elvis in a positive and negative light. All in all, as a normal guy, which he was! Told obviously by Priscilla, it's her point of view so perhaps it's skewed but I learned much I didn't know about the family and difficulties he faced. If you are a fan of Elvis, music, or old Hollywood this is a great book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not scratch the surface of the truth.","review":"Priscilla's account of her years with Elvis from the time they met in Germany up until the divorce is gappy, and full of self-pity. This reader would like to know, for one, more about her true feelings. I got the impression from reading this book that Priscilla was writing about the reactions around her instead of delving into herself and providing the insight that only the wife of the King of Rock'n'Roll could tell. She is good when it comes to funny stories about her life with Elvis, but spare when it comes to the deep feelings of rejection and sadness that she must have felt. It is for this reason, and this reason alone, that I did not feel justified in rating this book with more than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presenting The Priscilla Myth","review":"Simplistic in its writing style, Priscilla tells about her life and her relationship with The King. The truth is heavily embellished and \\"Priscilla-tized\\", making for a great romance novel but not for an accurate account of how she met Elvis and their relationship. If you do read this book, you ABSOLUTELY MUST read \\"Child Bride\\" by Suzanne Finstad along with it, and judge for yourself if Miss Priscilla is being completely honest with herself and with her readers. I could not help but feel a strong underlying resentment and jealousy towards Elvis that seeps through her narration. Priscilla's book has many interesting revelations and anecdotes, but after you read \\"Child Bride\\", it's more intriguing to see what Priscilla didn't include in her autobiography than what she did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis and Me and the clothes we wore","review":"That would of been a more appropriate title. I could not believe how fixated Priscilla is on her and Elvis's clothes. Grant it they were show-biz people and Elvis certainly liked clothes and obviously dressing Priscilla, but it seems every event she recalls is tied into their clothing apparel. Still it is quite enjoyable to see a side of Elvis form his one true love. The Elvis insights are great but the remembrances about herself are very weak, even though she was very young through the story she comes across as a very shallow person or maybe she just doesn't want to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"the gospel according to priscilla","review":"While parts of this book are interesting-the inside information on Elvis, and their life together, for example-there's just a little too much of \\"poor,pitiful, long-suffering Priscilla\\". Apparently she wasn't scarred to badly by the experience-she has shrewdly kept the presley surname and continues to pass herself off as The Widow Presley, despite their divorce and her continuing not-too-believeable claims that she wants to be known for \\"herself\\"-not just as Elvis's wife-make that EX wife. This book is ultimately self-congratulatory and predictable. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry and Brutal To the Max!","review":"Wow! Written after his death--before Elvis became the billion dollar \\"Cash Cow\\" that he is today--the author had no idea that the King would go on and become even bigger after death! The ex-wife obviously thought \\"Elvis was over\\" and that it was the beginning of her career.The book has got to be the coldest and cruelest rip off of the world's greatest entertainer. Her anger is so great that even after Elvis' death,the book was like she was trying to saw his coffin in two! How do true Elvis fans stand it that she is profiting so greatly from someone she so blantantly profaned to the world? The rape accusation--was that really necessary? She pictured Elvis as a blundering, drug crazed, frigid, psycho, sexual predator. I'm offended and the dead can't defend themselves.Obviously, the greatest tragedy in his life was his marriage to her. Shocking and very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This is a great work of fiction. How can we deny or comply with the words written? It's for Priscilla Presley alone to know if the truth was written or not. But, once you start the book, it's very hard to put down. The material immediately grabs you and hangs on for the remainder of the story. If you are looking for a book that hints at a biography, includes history, shines as a love story, and reads like a best selling fictional book, then this book is for you.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I haven't finish reading my book yet but so far I think i is really good.

First I studied \\"An introduction to Aramaic-second edition-by Frederick Greenspahn\\" (available from Amazon)using this book as a companion/advanced study tool. Greenspahn's book seemed more accessalble and user friendly but this book has important classical lessons and info. I would not want to be without.

The book certainly doesn't deserve it. Having read most of Coulter's other work, I can only conclude that she was having some sort of mental lapse during this book's creation. I would never have matched this hero and heroine. There was simply no connection between them, besides him saving her. They should have just been friends and gone on to more pleasant love stories. Also, there was much cruelty throughout the book--calculated rape, punishment, etc. I stopped reading this book several times, and only completed it out of sheer boredom on a rainy day. Unlike most other books of this genre, I was not left with warm, happy feelings after reading it. Disturbed and tormented would be a more acurate description. I do not recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a strong, sound love story. You'll be left wanting and unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"After the back of this book it sounded interesting. But it started out bad and went down hill from there.

It would have been nice to SEE his footwork on the tracks where it is hilighted. I don't think Tim put much time, thought, and preparation into this project. At best, it's a mediocre basement tape that should have been left in the basement. Sorry Tim. You can do better than this.

Also, he treats demographics as though he personally invented the concept.Overall, this book is just an attempt to convince the reader that his previous book, The Great Boom Ahead will be proven right, after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an exciting book.","review":"This book is about when Annie thinks Alex relies on her powers too much.

Unless you carry the manual with you or spend a lot of time memorizing how to get to different functions, you'll be frustrated if you want to calculate lap splits or change your target settings.Overall, it's good for what it's supposed to do and I'm happy. Strap works fine, monitor seems to be reliable (as long as you moisten the receptors, as it states in manual). I would rather have had a simpler one with less features, but they weren't any cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"This monitor has the basics along with some advanced features. I like having the alarms when I go out of my set training zone. The logic for the set up of the different screens takes some getting used to; just keep using it and it will make sense.

The only reason I didn't go for the 150 is because I already have a bike computer that I like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really confusing menus","review":"When it works, its great...but even after regular use, I'm not comfortable with the menu system.

Bulma gets captured too.What was pointless in this movie is this is suppost to be more like a teenage movie which it is except for one part were theirs this sing along sung by Gohan, that can hurt the DBZ image trying to be like Disney.

Out of all the 13 movies, this is one of the worst. Barelly any plot, you go from one thing, to something with nothing to do with it, in about 2 seconds. The fighting isn't really that great.

The movie is full of action and a little bit of humor, aswell as some drama. It is dubbed good, and the sound is decent. The special features on this one are better then Tree of Might's, but not quite as good as Dead Zone's. It has character bios, a video library, choices of dubbed or subbed (CC and subtitles are optional) and a unique feature called battle field... which is a series of fight sequences from DBZ eps and other movies.

Though there are some composers who were self taught and got on the right path, Mohr isn't one of them. This music is simplistic in conception, badly orchestrated,loosely held together, and reminds me of a lot of music I and other composers were writing as sophomores in college. Also, the CD is not mixed well and is poorly edited (if at all). The only merit this work has (and possibly the only reason this ever got recorded) is a fascinating story behind the piece that would undoubtedly sell a few copies to those who care to spend the money (BTW- don't spend the money, buy a milkshake or something instead). Why did you do this, NAXOS? Oh, why!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish, pretentious","review":"When I saw this in the store I bought it on impulse. So many of the Naxos American Music series recordings, even of unheard of composers like Carter Pann, have been so good. When I opened it and saw that the composer is 'self-taught', I thought, 'Uh oh!'And, I'm sorry to say, my initial skepticism was borne out. The scenario is pretentious in the extreme, undergirded by half-baked Jungian philosophy. The music itself is amateurish, poorly composed, poorly orchestrated, not terribly well performed.I have a guess: it is conducted by Theodore Kuchar, an excellent conductor. He had premiered it with his Boulder, Colorado, orchestra, and and has now recorded it with the Ukraine National Symphony, of which he is also the conductor. He has made many recordings for Naxos and Marco Polo. I suspect he was allowed to record this twaddle as payback for his Herculean services to the those labels. Is Mohr is cousin or something? It must be something like that.Sheesh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Environmental EIT guide","review":"This book did not help at all.

The source of insider transactions - Yahoo Finance. The author uses insider transactions as the sign of impending turnaround of shares that have been declining in price for a while. I guess the approach is valid, and insider transactions should be taken into consideration when buying shares.In short, this is another approach to investing/trading and could be used in combination with other methods. The book, though short, could be even shorter and should rather be a chapter in more comprehensive text. Then again, it tells you how to profit, and fifteen bucks is not much to pay for an investing idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little value","review":"This book gives a few useful insights about interpreting insider trading for making better investing decisions.

All the insightful information can be distilled into a mere dozen pages or so but since the nuggets are dispersed thoroughout the book, it would profit to read the whole thing. Just skip the nonsensical stories and try not to cringe at the earnest high school level writing style.I still recommend this book because it is rare to find a trading/investing book which focus is on following the transactions of public companies' insiders. In my opinion, insider information is one of the most important tools necessary to make high probability trading decisions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Read DVD Labels & Sony Could Care Less","review":"Great idea, poor follow through, no support. After loading over 350 DVD's, only 20 or so lables/titles were actually read by the player. Calling Sony resulted in \\"the player can't load the title to some DVD's.\\" A more accurate response would be \\"the player can load the title of a few DVD's.\\" Sony was very non-responsive and definitely had a care less attitude. Had we known this before purchasing the machine, we would not have wasted the money. The manual is poorly written, unclear and in small print - perhaps more to confuse the consumer, than to help.In any event, if you don't mind loading all the titles to the 400 DVD's you will load, then this is an OK machine.

About five I would characterize as gouges rather than scratches. I bought this changer to use with the Escient fireball as others have and found the quality to be otherwise average. I have had the unit for 5 years and it is full. I have a video issue where the brightness flashes occasionally, but I don't know if that is the player or the Fireball causing the problem.

I'm happy with it -- it never fails to play a selected DVD or CD, and the picture/sound quality is very good. Thr only drawback is Sony's \\"filing\\" system. It stinks. And it has lost data several times for no apparent reason, so I dont even use the filing feature anymore: Instead I developed a system using an MS Excel spreadsheet format to create two playlists, which I maintain on my PC, with printed copies near the Sony: The first Excel document is an alphabetized list by title, with the appropriate slot number in column #. The second Excel document is a numerical list by slot number, with the Title in Column 2, and comments (if any) in Column 3...Not a great way to maintain everything, but after I got it up and running, its been pretty easy to maintain it...Now that I'm close to using all 400 slots, I'm thinking of daisy-chaining another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"Audio and Video is excellent, however the machine is impossible to program.

He is whinny, self-centered, and very jealous of the Angels.After much complaining from Adam, God created Eve. Eve was God's epiphany.

Still, for a little novel, I enjoyed it, read it in about two sittings.I agree with much of the criticism in other reviews here, but can't be too hard on the book.

Like everyone here had stated so far, nothing from her final Arista album, the Brazilian project, is here and there is plenty of room for a cut or two from that album on the third disc which is two songs shorter than the other two discs. Her 1990 Cole Porter effort is represented in this collection by just one track. \\"You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To\\" was a vinyl \\"bonus track\\" from the Porter project and it would have been nice to see it's digital debut here. Still, this collection contains every hit and choice album tracks from Dionne's BMG catalog and is the closest thing to a boxed set of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Review","review":"The collection is a good review of Dionne Warwicks' recordings done for Arista records.

Then I discovered the RAZR.The RAZR has everything I want from a phone.Exceeding that, it's so compact that I don't even notice it's in my pocket. It has a speakerphone that I can use while closed and sitting on the seat of my car instead of holding while driving.

Since I am descended from native Americans myself, and am also a descendant of Owen Gwyneth, I found the subject matter more than academically interesting.

It's enough to turn somebody into an anthropologist...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserably disappointing -- not worth the effort.","review":"The book started out rather nicely, the prose was fresh and strong as it told the tale of the Welsh ship's approach to the New World, but it fell apart rather rapidly. The author could neither tell a story nor maintain his characters, all of whom spoke like they'd stumbled out of a grade \\"b\\" something. I love historical fiction, especially when it deals with aspects of history which are little known or with encounters between Europeans and American Indians, but this book let me down with a thud.

He is much to preoccupied with the subject of female genital mutilation and how it excites the Welsh occupiers of the land. It did very little for me It gets very boorish. The only good thing that I derived from this book was an interest in George Catlin, the gentleman who painted hundreds of Indians so people all over the world would be educated about the American Indian. His life was far more interesting than this book. Shame on you Thom. You could do so much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rather disapointed","review":"I am a great fan of Mr. Thom's work.

I liked it, so I ordered from Amazon and had it quickly delivered with Prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good shakes","review":"I love this shake mix; calories are fairly low, it has good fiber content which I haven't found in several others; and they taste great. I've tried Vanilla, Chocolate, and Strawberry and love them all. They blend well and quite easily with the blender bottle. My preference is to mix them with skim or 1% milk; I did try mixing them with water and they were actually not bad but my own preference is with milk. The only reason I deducted one star is the size of the plastic container they come in. I understand settling, but the contents only take up 1/2 the container and I'd rather have one more representative of the amount of mix that is inside. Other than that this brand of protein shake will be my go-to brand for future purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great and taste good too!","review":"I decided to try a sugar free shake to help curb my appetite with the hopes of losing weight.

The powder is extremely clumpy at first but does eventually blend fairly well. I tried this shake with 1% milk, and I can't even imagine how bad it would be with water. The texture is extremely grainy even once blended, so that it tastes like you are swallowing a bunch of sawdust particles with each sip.When it first hit my mouth I thought it was okay or even potentially good, but then I experienced the terrible aftertaste, which I assume is from the stevia sweetening. It is quite sickening. I have a pretty good tolerance with nutritional shakes and I was unable to finish this one on two separate attempts.As for hunger fighting, I didn't notice it working any better than other shakes.Gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"I like to mix vanilla shake powder with coffee.

I think this special extra fiber that they have trademarked was too much for me and my digestion track. I do eat pretty healthy I just eat too much and stay away from foods that upset my tummy, I am not allergic to any types of food. So I know it was not due to drastic change in my diet or a food allergy. After the 3rd day of giving it a try I am throwing away and am going to just get some whey protein powder for my meal replacement smoothie. It is not worth that type of pain and discomfort.

For others, the 1955-59 shorts are painful to sit through. Plenty of recycled footage, but not enough original material - guided by director Jules White at his heavy-handed worst. Moe, Larry, Shemp and Joe try their best to enliven the diminishing comedic returns and occasionally succeed.

At least my guess that volume 8 would be the remaining shorts, and not 1955 to 1957 with a year and a half remaining on volume 9. Granted, many of the last shorts with Shemp are either remakes or a lot of reused material from earlier shorts. Granted, that the last 4 shorts of the Shemp era were after he passed away with Joe Palma subbing for him (only seeing him from behind). But the best part of this collection is that all of Joe Besser's shorts are finally on the market. Even when the Stooges were shown on TV, there would only be a couple of Joe's shorts presented. Finally we will be able to see what has not been seen in a great many years. The only things missing from these collections are deleted scenes, bloopers, interviews with anyone still alive who worked with them, or their descendants, or their biographies.

My tank looks like a jungle and my plants and fish couldn't be happier. What's more, my water has been clear, my levels are completely stable and I don't have to clean my tank as often.

I love it! There's something addictive and meditative about this music -- the airy and sultry female vocals nearly float effortlessly above deep trance-like bass and drums. The effect is very nice indeed. I highly recommend this CD for fans of ambient and trip-hop (and even Dido, whose songs would fit in quite nicely on this sampler). Excellent music to drift in and out of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a compilation","review":"A compilation is a tricky beast, a delicate balance.

Though attaching a large piece of adhesive felt (like the kind used for furniture feet) to the baren helped, it still meant having to press quite hard, and sometimes ghosting would occur if the paper shifted even slightly. This press has done away with those issues, and I'm really thrilled. It also means less repetitive stress on my wrist and hands. My only complaint is that the press top is substantially shorter than the base, and thus it's easy to miss your target or press only part of your block if you aren't used to with how far the top comes down when you press. I really don't know why it wasn't made a bit longer, but it's definitely a solidly-built piece of equipment. Also folds flat for easy storage and transport. Wipes clean.

Although I have read and enjoyed many of the Lord of the Rings series, fantasy is not something I gravitate towards. This story actually had excellent character development, exciting battles, and a captivating plot. Enough so, that I read it completely through in one sitting. The relationships between ogre, goblins, elves, shape shifters, witch, and mage were intricately woven. I especially enjoyed the characters seeking out their destinies and whether that led them down a path of good or evil, each struggling with their true identities influenced by their heritage. Superbly written, I look forward to joining them in their next journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put it on your Wi'sh List","review":"I started with James Clemens' Immortal series & really liked those, so I checked out The Banned & The Banished...I'm on book 3 now.If you are not bothered by the aesthetic use of apostrophes, then this is a good series with some unique twists on familiar fantasy characters.The author has created some interesting characters with intersecting stories, which I always like.I particularly like the darker characters. Clemens describes some very nasty sounding baddies, which makes the confrontations more interesting.In book two, the description of the first couple of Il'guards is very graphic, & disgusting even for me. But very cool & creative.Overall, I think this series is another winner by Clemens & I have already bought books 4 & 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Tropefest","review":"A story only a Dungeon Master could love.

It is a very easy read and goes fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, needs better pacing and character development","review":"The book certainly packs a lot of action into short amount of space. I would have prefered to see a slightly slower pace to allow the characters to develop a bit more fully and give the reader a chance to digest the information and appreciate the implications of the storyline. The pacing reminded me of many of todays action movies ... plenty of bang, bang, bang with little time to breath. It seems geared more towards an MTV type audience.... those with a limited attention span and need for constant stimulation. I tend to like the more restrained pacing of Tolkien and Jordan (although Jordan is getting carried away with his tedious/repetitive narrative and plot development). Overall though the story is good and has some interesting twists. A map of the region would have been helpful. I am looking forward to reading the second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Cliche Fantasy","review":"This book begins with a nice flair and moves at very quick pace until you arrive at 100-130 pages which reads much like an horror novel if anything before it unfortunately digresses into your garden variety fantasy fodder. No where near the works of great fantasy writers such as Hobb, Martin, and Tolkien. No comparision! First-off book contains very thin history- or world-building. An important aspect that great writers like Martin and Tolkien went to great pains to create. That's a big substantial zero in my book. Despite lacking this substance the novel also descends into shallow and unorginal clichedom, it reads too familiar. I am not going to pick up the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!","review":"I agree with the other reviewer in the use of apostrophes but it didn't bother me as much as it did for them.The story immediately gripped me and every chapter was a cliff hanger.This is one of those stories where you are going along totally enthralled and all of a sudden you're getting the debrief on a whole other set of characters, but do not worry, the writer does take us back to Elena (the protagonist and her entorague).I only finished the first book but I have already purchased the rest in the series and am eager to sink my mind into them.I hope you enjoy them as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tale!

The world has unique inhabitants with different endearing human qualities all readers can identify. Heroes and outcasts are drawn together to save their world; but be warned--the role of hero, villain, and victim shifts quickly. Clemens does an exceptional job of keeping the reader engrossed--rare pauses allow the reader to relax only to find another twist in the land or characters. Read and enjoy the World of A'loa Glen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wit'ch Fire is a GREAT read","review":"Wit'ch Fire is everything I love about fantasy. The characters are instantly likable and you immediately get drawn into the conflict. The pages fly by and leave you wanting more.There's nothing better than dark evil magic brewing, chasing our heros around! Despite the complexity of the flashbacks and detailed mythology, the plot is easy to follow and makes you feel like you are really there.There are many familiar character; Giants, Witchs, Shapeshifters, Ogres, but never have they been written like this before. There is such an immediacy and intimacy with the characters you would just love to live in their world.I don't want to discuss too much about the characters or the plot because it is just too darn fun reading about it and finding out for yourself.

The story, however, was only at times engaging. I found the prologue a bit trite and skipped reading it.

Ran across it while looking to see if the new George Martin book is out. If you like the first efforts of Martin and Terry Goodkind you'll love this book. It's full of likeable characters, great dialogue, magic, adventure and action. All is not as it might first seem, there's lots of interesting twists in story line and interesting fantasy characters not seen in other efforts. I hope this author stays around for a long while as he gives promise of being one of very few great fantasy writers.

When I finally got around to reading it, I was probably fourteen or fifteen. Even at that age, it came off as a children's book.By no stretch of imagination is this book worth reading. it's very poorly written, and more often than not, you're left wondering how the writer thought he could pull some parts of the novel off.I'll admit, I didn't even finish this book. It was slow torture. I could stomach the parts about Elena, but when I got to the story about the Ogre, and the one about the shapeshifter--I mean, it isn't that it was too outlandish for me; at the time, fantasy was all that I read. And I have read some very good fantasy novels.This just isn't one.Run away and don't look back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"While the story is complex and the fantasy/magic elements are plentiful I was extremely bored with the characterization. The best adjective I can come up with for the Elena and her band is \\"pathetic\\" and that applies singularily and in group. I think the villans would have been more interesting, but we don't really see them. It is tough to identify with so many pure victims."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish it","review":"I was about 3/5 from finishing this book when it became due at the library. I didn't even bother finishing it. Although the work has a few potentially interesting characters, it reads much like a gaming session of DnD yet not as fun.

The NAC volume on 1,2 Samuel is another example of what I believe is the most effective combination of rich scholarship and quick study. Unless you work in the field of higher education, your career is probably not devoted to pages of peripheral minutia that, although interesting and brilliant, does not touch the core truths of the passages you're studying. The NAC does an outstanding job of balancing in-depth, first degree study while exploring the truths of the Bible for teachers, students, and clergy. This series is far and away my favorite for great study with an easily readable format and vocabulary. If you only want one commentary for 1,2 Samuel, start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for preachers","review":"I am presently preaching through the book of 1st Samuel.

The events that took place over a relatively short period of time were more than the average person deals with throughout their entire life. Traumatic would be putting it lightly. This is a prime example of average people being subjected to extraordinary events that they have little to no control over. As with many books of its kind, the author presented some predictions of future events that have not come to pass in their expected timeframe.

The marks supposedly left by the aliens are discussed in such detail that I found myself scanning over much of those parts. Additionally, the people in this book don't think very logically. They never set up some sort of video recorder at night to see what was happening during their \\"abductions\\". It was almost as if they wanted to be abducted so they could sit around and talk endlessly about the markings left on their bodies. There is also reference to something important which is going to happen just after these incidents occurred in 1988. Well it's been 10 years and the only thing that happened is I wasted my time reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great accessory!!","review":"Fit and finish are great for this item!! installed it on my new machine and will likely never take it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord Louis Mountbatten by Richard Hough","review":"The book gave me another prespective on Mountbatten's life, while focusing on him, rather than Edward VIII, George VI, Elizabeth II, Prince Philip or Prince Charles. He has always been something of a secondary character, while I know that isn't really true.Richard Hough knows his stuff. He has written a number of biographies of the larger family, and specifically on the Mountbattens, so I trust in what he has written.

I would recommend you have this whole series handy before you even have a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I should have taken into consideration the negative reviews on this book and taken them seriously. What a waste of money this product was in my opinion. I loved the book \\"What to expect when you are expecting\\" so I figured this book would provide the same enjoyment and was left disappointed. There's so much I didn't love about the book that all I can say is that there has to be something better out there and I will continue to look for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good reference book","review":"Just like it's predecessors, this is a very good reference book. I like the beginning of each age group, when they state what your child should be doing. It helped me keep track of where my son was developmentally.

Just use the index to look up issues as they occur."},{"rating":"2","title":"disappionting","review":"The other books in this series are great but I found this one to be alittle disappionting.

However, the more I get into this book, the more I think the ideas are antiquated and are in conflict with information now available on breastfeeding, sleeping, bottles, etc. I think the Dr. Sears book series is more helpful and identifies better with scientific and psychological evidence on the benefits of breastfeeding both babies and toddlers, attachment parenting, co-sleeping and avoiding the \\"cry it out\\" method. I also preferred the series of books \\"Baby Hearts\\" and \\"The science of parenting\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"another step down in the \\"What to expect seires\\"","review":"\\"What to expect when you are expecting\\" was a good source of information and I could tolerate the writing style. \\"What to expect the first year\\" was less useful and I could just barely tolerate the writing. \\"What to expect the toddler years\\" I find impossible to read. I can summarize the book as follows: \\"All toddlers are different. As long as you love them, you are doing your job as a parent. Don't worry about anything, they will grow out of it.\\" There, now you don't have to read it. If you just want to feel good, read this book. If you want real information and real advice, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"not as good as the first 2 but still pretty good","review":"The first two books in this series were never far from me during my pregnancy and my daughter's first year of life, but I use this one much less often. I think that is mostly due to the fact that I'm getting the hang of the whole mothering thing. I don't need to look up little things like how to change a diaper, but I do need it for big things like potty training or how to say \\"no\\" to my daughter without her laughing at me. The information is very good but the month to month organization that worked so well for the first two books doesn't translate so well to toddler development. Most of the things I've had issues with were nowhere near the month the issue was discussed in, so although I read the month to month chapters I usually have to resort to the index for questions. All the same, this is an excellent book and I don't think any new mother should be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better resources out there","review":"This book is probably helpful for basic first-aid and illness care. But the negative stance on breastfeeding past age 1 irritated me. If I weren't so comfortable that I am doing the right thing by continuing to nurse my 14-month-old, this book would have made me guilt-ridden. For a series that tries to extoll the virtues of raising a healthy child through the right diet, this forced weaning attitude is a serious contradiction. American women need to be educated about the value of prolonged breastfeeding for their health and their babies' health. This book does the opposite."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never finished it, and I never look at it.","review":"I read a bit of it.... to tell the truth you would be better off to but a years subscription to \\"parants magazine\\" or some other such...Most of the information will probably not be applicable to your child.. and you'll have many issues not addressed in the book.

(unlike \\"the first year\\" when problems are usually more clinical, cut and dry)And, most of the \\"advice\\" is things you have hear 1,000 times anyway, or just common sense.The only thing that is moderately useful is the medical section, but the layout of the book makes it impractical in emergencies... there are much better suited books for this purpose out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to read, but not always scientifically accurate","review":"The \\"What to Expect\\" books have become Gospel to pregnant women and new moms everywhere, but I take issue with some of the \\"studies\\" they generically refer to when citing what to most readers would seem like facts. Such as the claim that breastfeeding a child over the age of one has \\"no nutritional benefits.\\" This is just plain false. Do the authors think the nutrients, immunoglobins and healthy cells contained in breastmilk just \\"disappear\\" after our toddlers' first birthday party? The book is \\"dumbed down\\" for easy digestibility, but I often think the facts are overlooked as a result.Also -- tackling issues such as physical affection with our toddlers in terms of what's appropriate and what's not appropriate is utterly ridiculous (one of the entries refers to kissing our babies on the lips). Who are they to say? It's almost creepy that they even try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, it was okay, but...","review":"The first two entries into this library were great, but this book did not live up to my expectations.

There's still a lot of good information provided and it's all in one place."},{"rating":"1","title":"most awful series of books ever","review":"These books are good only if you want to feel guilty. For example, look up \\"month 16\\" and it will tell you that your kid should be scribbling with a pen on paper by precisely 16-1/4 months (I'm not making this up) and if not, take him to the doctor...It is only useful if you want to look up an actual medical problem; otherwise, spare yourself the sleepless nights of worry and consult your doctor for medical advice...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a guilt trip","review":"While I did appriciate the medical reference guide. I thought that the authors were quite biased. The overall attitude of this book is 'if you don't do it the way we do it then you're doing it wrong'The book gives reasons that have no medical basis as to why a mother must wean by 1 year. Anything other than letting your baby cry it out is seen as 'cowardly' and co-sleeping is completely looked down upon and discouraged.I found this book to be insulting, as if by following my insincts I was actually harming my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is poorly fomatted and inaccurate","review":"As the parent of a toddler, I find very few uses for this book. The question and answer format is impractical and difficult to navigate if you're in a hurry (and what parent isn't?). The section on common illnesses is poorly categorized by the name of the illness (if I knew that, I wouln't be looking it up). In addition, much of the information is just plain wrong. For example, the authors state that breastfeeding loses its value after the first year. This is in direct conflict with the World Health Organization's statement that children should nurse for at least two years. There are many other inaccuracies in the book. In short, I would avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as we'd hoped","review":"Definately doesn't live up to What to Expect the First Years.

I had the pregnancy one, and found it to be reassuring. I never got around to buying the first year one, and instead picked this one up. I knew from the beginning when they were basically discouraging breastfeeding that it was a mistake. I am not completely into attachment parenting, some of it works for us, some doesn't, but if you are then this book is not for you. There was really nothing that gave me an \\"ah ha\\" moment. It was all either common sense or contradictory, as other reviewers mentioned. I have found much more practical info on [...], or just my own trial and error and gut instincts. It \\"felt wrong\\" to let dd cry it out, so I just didn't. Check out Dr Sears instead and remember, you know your own baby better than anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to","review":"I got to the part about breastfeeding, and stopped reading. I mean breastfeeding coming between my husband and I. Forestalling development of self comforting skills. Increase of ear infection. if you nurse beyond a year. I did not read any reviews on this book prior to buying and sort of wish I had. So personal I think the book is outdated. Would much rather read something along the lines of the Girlsfriends Guide to Toddlers or the Emotional Life of Toddlers. My daughter is still nursing at 20 months, and has recently moved from the family bed into her own bed. At he rown request. And I will contiune nursing until my daughterdecided otherwise. SO anything with such a negative attitude to nursing is sat on the shelf until it is resold on Ebay."},{"rating":"1","title":"What to expect from this book? Garbage!","review":"The authors' tone is that of know-it-alls, yet, I see their credentials nowhere in the book! Hmmm...maybe, they have none!?The information given is simply their opinion presented as facts.The question/answer format is maddening and redundant.I stopped reading the book when I got to the section on why you MUST wean at 1 year old. Their reasons (read:opinions) are not based on any scientific data or research, and they go against what the American Academy of Pediatrics and all other medical organizations in the world recommend.Why an educated parent would want to get his/her info from a source as this obviously ignorant pair of women is beyond me...If publishers didn't just care about money, they wouldn't let this kind of garbage be printed.My copy of this book was picked up with th erecycling yesterday. Good riddance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good information -- too much oversight","review":"Overall a good book in terms of sheer information. Having the stages to refer to is very helpful to use as a guideline. However, the authors completely ignore the possibility of sleep sharing, which is a common practice among parents who practice attachment parenting. Detaching yourself from your child at night is something every parent should consider carefully. Americans, especially, take for granted that \\"crying your child out\\" is the right thing to do in all cases, and this book does nothing to dispel that tired, false, myth.A good read, but, as with anything, do what feels right. Don't let this, or any, book convince you to do something that feels wrong in your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obtuse and Unobtrusive","review":"I was unimpressed and also left quite uniformed on several issues concerning me.

I was quickly appalled at much of the \\"facts\\" presented by the book. It is quite one-sided and often missses the true needs of many toddlers. Nursing beyond the first year has many benefits, including in the middle of night for some children. This book only gives one side on this issue (as well as many others) and it's the negative one. I was also appalled by the recipe section. It contained only a few recipes and most of them were desserts. Toddlers don't need desserts even those that are \\"healthier.\\" I could go on, this book is off base more than it's on. Overall, I feel sorry for the children whose parents follow this book's advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too old, out-of-date?","review":"I almost ordered this book but good thing I realized that this book was published in 1994, almost 13 years ago!

There are a multitude of health benefits. In fact, the older the child, the more concentrated the immunities, antioxidants, etc. The Am. Ac. of Ped. recommends a bare minimum of one year, and after that, as long as the child and mother desire to do so, and the World Helath Org reecommends a bare minimum of 2 years. The human brain is not fully formed until age two, and thus, natural milk developed especially for humans is extremely important during this time.Also, crying it out is not necessarily safe if it has to be used too often. There are dangers of brain re-wiring for extended periods of crying due to abandonment.

The author gives many opinions about child development and \\"proper parenting\\" that are nothing more than her opinion or personal feeling and are not in agreement with other reliable sources of information. My biggest concern is the mis-information that she gives about breastfeeding, stating that it does not have any nutritional benefit after one year of age and suggesting that there is something wrong with continuing to breastfeed past one year. This simply isn't true and certainly should not be presented as anything more than her personal feelings on the matter.

This book has been a great resource to help me and my son figure out if our expectations are reasonable, and what to expect as my grandchild matures. It is not a manual on how to raise a child, but simply a guide to help with the many questions that arise as you are doing so.

In general, I feel their philosophy is too wimpy. They even say that some kids are just unhappy/grumpy by nature and that you can't do anything about it. I strongly disagree, and after purchasing a few more parenting books, feel that my son is so much happier, communicates with me better, and I enjoy being a mother so much more!

I had some powerful HP laser printers back at work, and the MF4150 is nearly as fast, being half the size! Excellent choice for a small apartment or a small office. The only con is that it doesn't come with the USBa/USBb cable to connect the printer to the computer.

Moreover, the Canon driver utility does not function under OSX. The Canon techs were no help, but admit that the 4150 does not allow scanning to a Mac. There is no warning on the Canon website, yet by offering the Mac driver software, Canon implies a compatability that isn't there. The 4150 will function as a stand-alone copier and fax machine, but documents cannot be faxed from the computer.

Options were to have a replacement mailed and return my unit, or take it into a repair center.Seriously, does anybody actually check these things before they go out the door? I know I'm working with a small sample size (1), but I can't help wondering if anyone else has had a similar problem.For what it's worth, the machine worked great for the 5 print/copy/scans we did before it broke, but that would leave me with a $50 per use cost on the first machine and I don't think that's very attractive to most business users."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAIT AND SWITCH MF4150 & MAC","review":"After several hours of reading, installing, and trial and error, I am unable to connect my MacBook Pro to the Canon MF 4150 via airport.

The no recipients message is given every time I try to print. Fax is not even an option at this point. I do not recommend.I did read the side of the box prior to purchase that the Canon stated that it had limited functionality of only fax and print (this was all I needed). Yet, it still did not work.

I'm replacing it because I needed a new fax machine and having one machine rather than 2 in an office made good sense. Plus the Canon is faster and duplexes.I'm not generally a fan of all in one products because one of the functions seems to suffer. But this seems to work fine.

I know that the duplexer inside the printer works (I can make two-sided copies), but Canon's Mac software doesn't support two-sided printing. How hard can that be.Second, there is no scanning software for this Canon unit. None at all. How hard could it be to include a TWAIN driver or some basic scan-to-tiff or scan-to-pdf support?Finally, I could not get any news from Canon's customer support about when, or even if, their engineers were planning to support these features on their OS X driver.

He exchanged it in an office supply store and is very happy with the complete printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two problems leading me to return it","review":"I really like this printer in theory -- but am returning it, for two reasons. First, the good: it prints well, and does everything it says it will do well, is nicely designed, etc.Now, the bad.First, it won't work with an Airport Express print router (even just as a printer). The Brother MFC I need to replace would do so, and I guess I'm going to have to go back to Brother. (I didn't expect it to allow scanning wirelessly -- that entails data upstream rather than downstream -- but printing it should have been able to do. I've confirmed with Canon, however, that it will not work.)Second, as others have said, I cannot get it to print duplex on a Mac. (It will duplex from my WinXP computer, but not from my Mac.) Really frustrating, as the Mac print driver has an option for duplex printing -- but it is always grayed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love my new printer. My favorite feature is the duplex printing. It saves me SO much paper. Set-up was easy, print quality is excellent, and scanning was easy also. As a graduate student I print a great deal of research and have spent hours tinkering with ink jet printers. I also had to replace the ink cartridges from the ink jet printers every 2 months. I just got sick of it. When I saw this CANON printer for under $200, I just couldn't pass it up. It was one of the best purchases I have made for myself thus far in graduate school. Love it, love it, love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, Easy to Install, Great Value","review":"Small biz office environment here, so the Canon is a fantastic upgrade from a Brother MFC. Very easy to install, intuitive user interface and great quality prints, copies and scanning.

Its very small to fit easily on your desk, its quite, and fires right up to print. Im a print focal at my job and we use commercial grade Lexmark devices. But as for this canon product they have done a great job at a good price. The duplexing feature is a very nice plus. To get the duplexing feature to work, since most people dont understand how, is simple. Right click on the printer (in printers and faxes) and go into preferences and change your profile option to 2 sided. Its just that easy. It saves on paper for my wife whose a realator and burns alot of it. Thanks canon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this printer!","review":"Sure, this product works just great... until it breaks!!! I bought this printer because it was an editor's choice from PC Magazine, but obviously, they didn't use the printer for more than 30 days. Mine malfunctioned in less than 90 days. Just do a search on the internet for \\"Toner Is Not Set, Insert Toner\\" and see some other people's experience. After 90 days, Amazon won't replace/refund, and the nearest Canon repair center is over 100 miles away. The worst part is I spent almost $100 on a new toner cartridge because I believed the error message. Horrible Product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent multi-function printer","review":"I really needed a versatile printer/scanner and bought this unit, based on the positive reviews. Although I don't use the fax portion (no need), I am delighted with the printer/copier/scanner functions. The supporting documentation is substantial, so you have plenty of guidance for any questions. The drivers installed easily into my Windows XP PC, and best of all is the Canon Toolbox software which lets me scan files to JPEG, or PDF, or even do an OCR conversion using the included Scansoft software. It also has a very small desk footprint. Overall, I'm very pleased with the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine with PC. Very limited functionality with Mac.","review":"I bought this machine because I wanted a multifunction laser that worked with both PC and mac for my home office. With my XP machine, all of the bells and whistles work. I can scan directly to PDF in a couple of seconds. I love it.For a Mac, however, the only functionality is laser printer. No scanner, no scan to pdf, no fax from computer. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT. Otherwise this thing would get 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"toner runs out almost immediately","review":"If you don't mind spending $80 on toner every thousand pages, this is the machine for you.

First, they have NEVER supported scanning on a Mac with this machine. The driver has always been crippled in that respect. Then, it took them 2-3 months to get a crippled Snow Leopard driver out and it *barely* worked. You had to print 1 page at a time and could not duplex print. Then they finally released v2.05 of the driver and printing was OK but you could no longer share the printer out to other computers (either Mac or Windows). They COMPLETELY bungled the Snow Leopard driver. I'm still waiting for a full-featured (I NEED TO SHARE THIS PRINTER!) driver to come out. It shared fine under Leopard but if you install the latest driver under Leopard or Snow Leopard it will not share out. [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have a Mac, move along - nothing to print/scan/fax here","review":"I'm a big fan of Canon cameras, lenses and even their printers. I bought this multifunction unit to give me the print/scan/fax functionality. Unfortunately, it is not possible to get any of these features to work consistently from an Apple manufactured computer. Not on Mac OS X, not on Windows 7 through Boot Camp at least. If you have a Mac, do not buy this printer. I have spent many hours looking for work arounds and drivers, but the printer is getting older and it doesn't look like Canon or Apple (or whoever is responsible for the difficulties) will ever write the drivers for this to work. I've had it for about two years and it's never really worked consistently.While I can generally print a page or two from Mac OS X, eventually, its back to non-functioning status. If you have a wife or kids who want to print anything - this is not the printer your looking for. Don't get me started on faxing or scanning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the box perfection","review":"I bought this two years after its release date (today is March 07) and with my XP home system EVERYTHING worked great, right out of the box. With my printer and fax replaced by this I have: 2 more feet of desk space, double sided printing, replacement hardware at less than half the cost of either of the machines it replaced, mature drivers, easy installation (still 2 hours for everything, duplex printing, warrenty, one touch buttons etc.) and a system that works as you would expect. I wish all computer experiences were like this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FULLY MAC COMPATIBLE","review":"The printing and copying functions work fine, but there is NO SCANNER DRIVER FOR MAC. Unfortunately, I used the machine before I discovered this. I regret buying it, because I need the scanning function and simply don't have it. I spoke with Canon customer service and emailed them and they don't seem particularly concerned about this problem. If you're a mac user -- be forewarned! -- don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after a year and a half.","review":"I've had this product for about a year and a half, and for the most part it has worked well. Two days ago I got the \\"toner not set\\" message. Tried reinserting the cartridge multiple times, tried a different cartridge, I even tried shaking the stupid thing like one reviewer suggested. Finally I called Canon and was told it's a sensor problem and I'd just have to send it in to be fixed (of course no warranty any more).I don't personally consider a year and a half to be sufficient time before a product breaks down, planned obsolescence or not. I'm just going back to my HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Duplex Printer for Home / Home Office","review":"I have used this machine for Printing, copying and occassional scanning.I was using Lexmark Inkjet for few years and upgraded to this Laser Printer 3 months back.Awesome features:1. Very quiet performer2. Environment friendly (in terms of saving energy and paper)3. Friendly User Interface4. Quick Set up; though some reviews scared me, it was easy to install5. Printing: Very good quality at great speedNot so awesome:1. Sometimes it draws 2 papers and prints properly on the first one. Though it spits both the papers out, it beeps Error signal. Since there was no paper jam, I didn't know how to get rid of Error beep. No alerts or prompts; I had to re-start the printer to conitue my printing. This has happened 4 or 5 times in the last 3 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"My scanner Is Very Blurry","review":"For my small business I use all of the functions of this all in one printer. I am very dissapointed with the scanning feature. It is giving me terrible, blurry images. I really hope I am doing something wrong but I have tried many different ways and I still get a very blurry image. Tomorrow I am calling canon to find out what the problem is. I am setting it at the highest resolution with no compression. I haven't tried the printer/copier/fax yet so I don't know. So far I am very upset about this purchase. 3hrs in the scanning already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent MFC","review":"I purchased this after returning a defective Brother MFC-7820N. The Canon seems to be sturdier than the Brother I returned. My only regret is that the Canon does not have a network interface like the 7820N."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Mac this is multifunction minus one...","review":"I bought this Canon to replace an inkjet multifunction which had high cost ink, and I rarely used color anyway. Works OK with mac as a printer, but there is no way to get a scanning function with Mac OS, and I've spent hours trying. On the good side, it works well as a stand alone fax and as a copy machine, so it is, at least, not completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper feed not working","review":"This printer never really worked.

The copy cuality is very good. The fax, just Excellent. More, the Saving mode is great because even if you send something to print, it stand in this mode and print the document!!And as a gift, you can copy on duplex or just collate them.Just, the best machine for low/medium use."},{"rating":"1","title":"does NOT do double-sided copying!","review":"The description and specifications for this unit are very misleading:it doesn't do duplex scanning and the \\"double-sided\\" copying function only means double-sided printing of single-side originals.

It's going back to amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this device if you don't have a dedicated phone line","review":"If you do not have a dedicated phone line you cannot receive phone calls without the fax interrupting the call which is incredibly annoying. I called Canon and that's how the machine is suppose to work. So you either use it manually or don't receive incoming calls or get a dedicated phone line. A truly ridiculous result for a personal fax machine! If I had known in advance I would not have purchased the device."},{"rating":"2","title":"great machine","review":"This is my first laser printer for the home office. I have had a string of inkjet printers that mostly quit or worked poorly after a year.This is a fairly compact for a Multi-function machine.I have only used it a few times but the copy, print and fax functions work great. The cost is very reasonable. I like that it is a Canon, as they make great digital cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great...for a week","review":"I bought this based on customer reveiws.

Image Capture software within Mac also does not work. Mac users please do not buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small business printer","review":"I bought this printer about three months ago and have used it for scanning, copying and printing. I have used a number of HP printers for the home and small office in the past. The functionality of this printer would be hard to beat. I have not enountered any software delays, as seems to occur with the lower-priced HP scanners, and the Canon MF4150 allows for easy scanning into PDF format. The print quality is terrific and the pages come out quickly. As other reviewers have said, the printer is quiet and does well in standby mode. I would highly recommend this printer, especially based upon the fact that Dell, HP and others are peddling low quality lasers that only handle printing for $100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for a Canon Printer","review":"I bought this Canon MF4150 printer after my thirteen-year-old HP 4L bit the dust. The Canon MF4150 works great. You will need to purchase your own USB cable, but once you hook it up, you'll probably like this printer. It is fast, and the print quality is excellent. The copier also works great, as does the automatic feeder. Setup is quick too. The menus are pretty easy to navigate when setting this up. Replacement toner cartridges are a little pricey, but there should be some good deals out there on refurbished toner cartridges. All-in-all, this seems to be a good printer, offering good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Snow Leopard drivers available!","review":"It has been over 3 months since the release of the Mac OSX 10.6 and to this day Canon has still not been able to provide a functioning printer driver for this machine. The response of their customer support people is essentially \\"It will be coming when it's coming\\" but it is evident that no real effort is undertaken to correct the problem, particularly in the light that Apple had made versions of 10.6 available to developers months ahead of time.In addition, there is absolutely no scanner support under OSX for this device - never has to the best of my knowledge. Although Canon sells this machine as Mac compatible, that is simply not true. They have always supported this device half-heartedly in the past and not at all since the inception of 10.6, and it also affects other machines in this product line, such as the 4350, etc.It is shameful for a company like Canon to behave that way towards its customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jams constantly when printing two-sided","review":"If two-sided printing is important to you, run from this printer. I did my research and thought I was making a smart buy, but this printer jams 4 out of every 5 times I try to use the two-sided printing function.The manual itself acknowledges that \\"paper jams have occurred in the machine when making two-sided coping or two-sided printing.\\" In my experience that is a comic understatement.Now I have to box it up and mail it back to Amazon. Thankfully, Amazon is great with returns or I would be stuck with a very expensive piece of junk. A very overrated printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all in one printer","review":"Had a Canon ink jet all in one machine, liked it but it stopped scanning about a year after I got it. I don't need color printing, just fast, good copies,faxing and scanning. The MF4150 was exactly what I needed. It does a great job and suites my needs perfectly.It has a much more solid build quality than the more home use class that Canon puts out. I also would suggest that the published print times are in no way comparable, even though the 2 machines are both rated at 28 ppm b&w. The MF4150 is much faster, and better print quality. Amazon provided timely shipping and at no cost! Can't believe this product is as good as it is at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than expected!","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for.

Also the AT&T; technician didn't know that the phone access should be turned off every day for a few minutes or it will not work correctly.I will say the technicians were very courteous and worked to get the phone working well.So now I am satisfied and have used it trouble free for about 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 phones and counting...","review":"I've had the same problem other users are having with the losing signal and never finding it again with Cingular.

I am longtime Palm user and decided to try the Treo instead of carrying two devices. I use my Palm for just about everything: calendar, music, ereader, web, email, etc.As noted by other reviewers, the battery life leaves a lot to be desired. It drains even when you turn EVERYTHING off. Thinking it was a bad battery, I bought another one. Same problem. I googled the problem and found this a common complaint. I found a posting that suggested a \\"soft reset,\\" which entails removing the battery for a few minutes and then recharging. This resulted in a slight improvement, but nothing significant.The touchscreen is either too sensitive or completely unresponsive. I've recalibrated the stylus too many times to count.

I've wanted a TREO for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one. You can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software, it's a nice little phone.I haven't bought a memory card for it, so I can't report on the mp3 capabilities, but I am going in that direction.

Having seen focus groups used in many settings I wanted to know more about the research design portion of the process. This book seemed to be a good distilation of a larger work, and that is why I call it the cliffs notes version. There is enough here for anyone needing a brief overview, including advice to help a researcher determine if a focus group will produce the results needed for your project. Overall I found Focus Groups as Qualitative Research very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for practitioners and achademy","review":"I found this book good and practical. Probably too much achademy language on it, but still with a very good amount of practical advice. I have not read it all but still I found the target chapters useful, friendly and to the point. Plenty of good references to the critical books and articles. Some paragraphs were golden to me as for example the topic on segmentation, But the best were the criteria to organize the full focus group exercise and the full rationale behind it. I would certainly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous Ring","review":"I bought two of these rings, one for my daughter(Her birthday was on Mother's Day this year) and one for me.

It requires THREE watch type batteries, which cost us $10. That was a month ago, and the batteries are already dead. It's not as fun as you'd think, as the \\"tools\\" don't really do anything. There is a button that you press and Diego says a few things, but that's about it. There's a \\"magnifying glass\\" that flips up, which doesn't actually magnify. Oh, and it will clip onto a belt, if you get an adult to help you as it's really tough to do. Not worth the money, there are other more fun things in the line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This item was supposed to arrive two days earlier than it did as it was a gift for my nephew.

It's one of my all time favourites, despite the historical inaccuracies.This book, however, is complete rubbish. I saw the movie before I read the book, so I was able to project pre-formed images and ideas into what I was reading. That made me able to finish this book. The grammar is so awful that one wonders how an editor would allow it to be published. It seems like he wrote a 10 grade (long) report on the movie. Images were not completely described, dialogue was not inserted well into the text and generally it was painful to get through. It does complete injustice to the wonderful screenplay that he wrote. My advice - stick to writing screenplays Mr. Wallace and leave the novel writing to novel writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Tear-Jerker","review":"After watching the movie, which has since become my favorite, I rushed out to read the book. I was not disappointed. Given, it isn't historically accurate, but with the extra kicks the author puts in both the novel and the movie, it helps enhance the story. Although books are usually better in the movie, I must beg to differ on this one. The book was excellent, but you just can't beat the film's special effects and Mel Gibson in a kilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"See the movie; don't read the book.","review":"In the movie version of \\"Braveheart,\\" I was able to overlook the historical innacurracies because of the excitement of the battle scenes and the epic feeling of the entire movie. But in this novel version, those inaccuracies are glaring,and this reader - without the stirring excitement of the movie battles - could not overlook them, and could not enjoy the novel because of them. Even were the story fully accurate historically, it is not very well-written, and, as another reviewer stated, is a fit story for children, but adults had better seek another source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, poor book","review":"I'm a huge fan of the movie. I think it had excellent everything and wonderful music. But the book was awful-if I hadn't seen the movie and felt some devotion to it, I would have quit in the middle. The movie was quite inaccurate, but the action and storyline made up for that. But how can I comment on the book? I could say it was poorly written, or I could say that the plot was deviated with holes, or that William's eye color changes, and we never know what Murron is embroidering, or I could just say I wasted my time reading it. Unfortunatly for Randall Wallace, I rarely forget. Let's just say I won't be reading any of his books anytime soon. Don't waste your money-just watch the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't happen","review":"It's all right as long as you don't mind the fact that Wallace died before Princess Isabella married the prince; Wallace and the Bruce are unlikely to have had many personal conversations; Wallace probably died during the torture and did not yell out freedom like some superhuman. Aside from that, it is an epic story that became that incredible movie. An entertaining read if you don't mind complete bastardization of Scottish history.For fact, try \\"William Wallace: The Man Who Was Braveheart.\\" I don't remember the author, but it's a pretty fast, interesting book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish...","review":"..I could say I loved the book as much as the movie but unfortunately, that's not the case. I always prefer books over movies so having seen this excellent movie a billion times (more or less), I decided to read the book. Talk about being disappointed! If I hadn't seen the movie first, this book would have been discarded after chapter one but instead, I just kept reading and hoping the story would pick up eventually. Alas, it just dragged on and on. I wonder if Mel Gibson read this book before making the movie? If he had, I think he would agree, his script is way off Mister Wallace's version of the event's which took place in Scotland. A lot of people who reviewed this book seemed to like it but I can only be honest in my opinion by saying I didn't like it and I suggest you stick to the movie version just for the action scenes alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Braveheart by Randall Wallace","review":"As a Scotsman I first of all had grave doubts about seeing the movie version of BH. I was glad to find that it was quite an emotional film however. RW's buik however could perhaps be a little misleading to those not familiar with the story of WW, who think that this is how it happened. Personally I thought it was quite a guid buik for a 12 year old say, but if older readers wish to read a work of fiction which sticks more to the facts then they should seek out the buik \\"The Wallace\\" by Scots author Nigel Tranter. This buik makes BH luik like a Disney novel. I gave this review 3, not because of it's reliance on history, but more for the fact that it's an excellent adventure yarn for 12 year olds!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not pure","review":"I have baked with this organic vanilla in the past and realized that it is not a \\"pure\\" vanilla extract.

Terrible portrayal of women, despite the cultural differences of that era (circa 1959 - 1960).

It is very easy to get confused due to the fact that the author continue to ramble on using complicated terminology. For readers with a lot of backround in endocrinology, biology and the structures of the brain, the book may be of some use - even though I have all of those backgrounds, I still found the book a terrible read due to all the rambling and repetition - very confusing book - you have to reread many of the paragraphs to figure out what he's talking about. For anyone just looking into the subject, don't bother with this book (try Life - The Science of Biology by Purves, Sadava, etc. for general biology or Animal Physiology by Randall, Burggren and French for a more advanced physiology text - both great books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"While many things from years gone by are superior in quality, creativity and craftsmanship to todays goods and services, this DVD of Berenstain Bears episode is quite the contrary.

Replaced 10 year old air horns that were performing poorly in cold weather. Documentation notes a 20amp fuse should be used, and the horns come with a relay if you don't have a 20amp horn circuit. You must provide your own wire. Actual amperage is about 8-9amps, but according to Wolo this has the potential to double to 16-18amps, hence the 20amp fuse suggestion. Wolo also indicated that if the horns are connected to the car alarm, the motor could burn out prematurely due to the short bursts. Do not recommend this air horn to people inexperienced with their car's electrical wiring or air horns.Horns failed from 9-12 months of use, and are warranted for only 3 months.

The set delivers on these points as long as you don't need to move the countersink towards the tip to accommodate a shorter screw. The set screws that hold the countersink in place have very little to take purchase on when it is moved onto the flutes of the drill bit. Thus, the countersink has both slipped and wobbled.

When I think of Japan the last things that come to mind are junkies, crime, and moral bankruptcy. I can't say this book has made me feel any better about anything, but it has shown me that the sort of problems infecting America today are common elsewhere too. If I had to compare this book to anything else, I'd say the author is close to Brett Easton Ellis in his dry, morbid, clinical description of some rather unsavory, unsympathetic, and generally unpleasant characters.

Never has such a short book felt so agonizingly long. Murakami's book is a study in the many nadirs of Japanese drug users in the 1970s. Their relationships are strained, the drugs are addictive and horrible, and sanitation is absent. The book feels exaggerated and stylized, as if the author magnified his own experiences five-fold. There's a kind of cool glossiness in the tone. This distance partly works: the characters feel like walking dead, but partly creates a kind of depraved allure. In the end, the book could be read as a \\"just say no to drugs\\" scree: its people are empty and unreflective. Redemption is no where to be seen--not for its characters or for the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't we read this all before?","review":"Street cool characters drink, do drugs and have a lot of group sex - then the protagonist decides there must be more to life than that.Well, yeah.This novel aspires to Camus \\"L'Etranger\\" but without the philosophical underpinning we're left with pure derivation. There's the same tone of voice, the same sensuousness of description, the same criticism of contemporary values, but no ideas beneath the surface.

I'm not sure that the characters in the story ever find stability, but they do glimpse at authenticity at moments. The story is a bit disturbing by its sense of hopelessness and consistent passivity, but then most good existentialist (nihilistic?) tales are like that. I recommend this book because of the author's great ability to show us the inner emotions (or lack thereof) of his characters.

That book, a novel, is called The Good Men: A Novel of Heresy and was written by Charmaine Craig.Ms. Craig has done a SUPERB job researching for this novel and her writing style gave life to these characters who are based on real people who lived in the Middle Ages.

I won't be surprised if this novel garners lots of awards. Ms. Craig's masterly prose, her eye for detail, and her ability to find emotional nuance in scene after scene, transported me to another place and time, where her characters struggle, each in their own way, with how to live life. Like in all great works of literature, the characters are often flawed, but through Craig's compassionate telling, each takes on a kind of dignity and human grace, right down to the fallen priest, Pierre Clergue, whose final act (which I won't give away) is so right and momentous, that it gives reason and meaning to his life in its very last seconds.

I've bought them for years in bulk at Sams. They are the only bar I've seen without HFCS that tastes great. I eat them and feel good about giving them to my family instead of those 'fruity HFCS' bars for snack. When I bit into the 'new' bar the chocolate was very smooth and the inside 'crunch' was chewy. I knew that 'chewy' generally comes from HFCS - it's cheaper.I called customer service and explained that HFCS goes against everything the Zone is! Abbott Labratories said they have distanced themselves from The Zone and their affiliation with Dr Sears. They explained that they did add calcium and fiber to the bar. However, if you look at the nutritional info the bar is no longer 40-30-30 and sugar and salt contents have also gone up.If you're disappointed with the change please call them!

The other flavors were mediocre at best, but this chocolate peanut butter bar is DELICIOUS and is FAR better-tasting than other brands of nutrition bars like South Beach Diet bars or Balance bars.

She never imagined a situation like that, a state of being like that, possible. To her frienship was hanging out with someone until they tried to kill her.Yes, she was a spoiled brat. She was meant to be. Nobility and honor were things she had to learn. So was the reality of consequences for actions. She had to grow up. By the end of Tangled Webs, we believe she's done it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal","review":"Lirel is not a very interesting character. I was thinking that she wasn't well described, but I think Elaine Cunningham did a very good job at describing a very boring person.The books major problem is that it is formula drive and there is nothing original about it. The bad guys are more interesting, but it's not written so we should care about them. If there was no Lirel and the book was about everyone else, then I would have like to see who came out ahead even thought they are all scum.The books first 10 pages are tbe best. It slowy goes downhill, but the las 100 pages are unbearable. Why does she have to make the story end like a hollywood movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for patient Drow fans","review":"While the story flows well, Ms. Cunningham's grasp of Drow culture in Menzoberranzan and life in the underdark is at best tenuous. At times I felt as if I was reading a bad episode of \\"Menzoberranzan goes Beverly Hills 90210\\". Liriel, the main character is interesting however for a magic user incredibly skilled as a warrior. The introduction of the other drow deities is the book's saving grace. I believe Ms. Cunningham should stick to writting about the surface elves, where she's more cofortable with the setting, henceforth making for much better stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This book was just plan awful. I can't believe I read the entire book, I should've stopped reading it after the first ten pages (which was the only good part of the book). The characters are not interesting and as a matter-of-fact I hated them. The main character Lirel (sp), seemed to me like a spoiled brat not a deceitful drow. The Fodo, fordo, whatever his name was barbarian/warrior character was only cool when he got mad (which he didn't do a lot) and his backround story was a joke. I higly recommend to NOT read this book. It gives a poor description of the drow life and Menzoberranzan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire.","review":"The author has no grasp of Drow society and her attempt to make a teenage love story out of what should have been an exciting book is a total failure.The main character has no depth at all and the whole story is shallow.

I wasn't really sure I wanted to read the Drizzt novels until my boyfriend gave me this to read. I loved it. It's a great story. However, don't go into it expecting Drizzt it's not. This is Liriel's story. When I found out there were two more books, I decided I had to come order them. I have also now read the first three drizzt novels..and love them. It reads easily and is a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I personally loved this book. The only reason I rated it as a four star book was because the first few pages were hard to follow. The beginning, and I mean in the VERY beginning, there is a lot of characters to be introduced. I had to do a bit of back skimming to remember them, but it worked out fine. Its easily followed as soon as you get out of the first few pages of the book. i love the idea of a rebel drow, one who dreams and aspires to have adventure. Liriel is a dynamic character who loves to party, but still has ruthless drow qualities. Fyodor is a simple human feeling simple feelings for this Drow girl, even though he knows the drow are ruthless beings. I highly recommend this book for someone who is patient and can follow a plot. you will get into the very heart of the book and hardly want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful....

For example, chapter 9, exam question 7 has no right answer because none of the T-SQL code samples actually work!In a backward sort of way, this book will prepare you for exams 70-175 and 176 because you'll reference Microsoft's documentation so often to correct errors in the text that you'll know your subject by the time you've worked your way through the book.Two stars for the review outline, but there's probably something better on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Significantly better than average!","review":"Overall: One of the best technical books I have ever read. A reference worthy of keeping on the shelf even after you've passed.I passed 70-076 with a 94% and 70-175 with a 90% after reading this book.I agree with the other reviewers on these points:There are a few errors (grammatical and technical).Sure, it is a LOT of material (more than you need to pass), but it is a well rounded overview of the features of VB6. You won't regret reading it.The coverage of the 70-175 exam objectives is a bit thin.Use Transcender test prep to supplement this book. I found Transcender to be much closer to the actual exam than the questions in the book and on the CD Rom. Many questions on the actual exam were exactly the same as the Transcender questions.I posted this review 7-13-2000.

It is NOT!The actual text is a mish-mash that reads more like a catalog than a text book. The teaching aids were layered on top of a product that seems like a brain dump, not a planned, organized exposition. And the errors are very disturbing; they are littered throughout the text. Prepare to be frustrated by the poor continuity and segues from hell. Terms are often used extensively before being defined, as example. Much of the subject matter is assumed to be known in advance, so the presentation that is offered ends up being rather weak.I am looking for a better text!

The sections did not have enough detail to teach you much. On several practice tests, I found that I got questions wrong only to find out that the answer was not displayed as an option.

Consult other resources before taking any tests."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Guys that Wrote this Book are Retarted","review":"I read this book cover to cover. There are no less than 500 errors, omissions, typos, and contradictions in this text. However, the book does attempt to address all of the exam objectives published by Microsoft. It touches on the basic essentials and should be used as a starting point to do your own research. This book must have been written in about 20 minutes and proofread by a monkey, because it is quite inaccurate and hilarious in some cases. Be forwarned that if you plan to pass the exams you should not believe any information in this book, but just use it as a general guide. I cannot believe Microsoft approved it as a study guide. Some of the code snippets in this book do not even run. Good Luck, and Beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book - I passed the exam 70-176.","review":"It covers things at the level of detail that you need. I've only taken the 70-176 exam so far (I scored 90%). This book will prepare you. I also recommend that you get the www.transcender.com software - excellent practice software. Between that software and this book, you will pass. I was somewhat disappointed that the errors/corrections are not yet available on the newriders web site for the book. It looks like that is coming soon though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Big ?","review":"This is a pretty good reference (I still have it and use it), but it is too big for the material covered. My bookshelves are overflowing (I have gotten rid of many GOOD books) and it is frustrating when a book is good enough to keep, but the material could have fit into a space half its size. Still, one of the better VB6 references."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the better books for these exams","review":"This book covers well in some areas, such as creating data access and creating user interface. It provides not only the explaination, but also detailed screen shots and examples for those areas. But it does not have enough information for deploying, maintaining and supporting an application. For example, it only has a small section talking about DCOM configuration, and did not go into detail for configuration COM on win95 client (which showed up couple times on the exam I took).Overall, this is one of the better test prep books on the market.

It says the answer to finding a record in a ADO recordset where the Number is less than 75. heres ther correct answer. .Find \\"ID > 74\\", adSearchForward. Hmmm Whats wrong with this picture. This is one of many misleading errors. Due to the Accuracy of the Tests I have to say the book fails in its purpose (Exam Preparation).

And they are there, but to me it really didn't detract much from the excellent teaching method consistent throughout most of the book. Having looked at quite a few others, I'd say this is the one to go with for the desktop exam. (I passed yesterday using this, Transcenders, and some of Exam Cram). You will definitely need to supplement this book with other materials (Transcenders is worth the high price) but I don't know what I would have done without Hawhee as my core reading. I hold back from giving it 5 stars only because of inadequate coverage of P&D Wizard. (Nobody else covers it well either. Everyone just walks you through it, but the test wants fairly extensive knowledge of the separate files.) All in all, however, I think if you're taking 70-176, Hawhee is superb, a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of mistakes and inconsistencies","review":"Both the book itself and the testing software have a lot of mistakes and inconsistent information. The text of the book says one thing, but the test answers say something different. Because of this I often had to stop, and research from other sources to find out whether the text in the chapters, or the answers from the review and exam questions was correct. And I've downloaded the errata from their website, and it covers some of the inconsistent information, but not nearly all of it. For a book that was published almost 2 years ago, you'd think they could put correct info out there to use.And their testing software apparently has no updates; but it has a lot of incorrect info in it also. So you may get a lower score when you take their tests than you should have received."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is full of errors, doesn't worth the money","review":"This book is full of errors; if you try to prepare for an MCP exam, use it with caution. When I used it, I always had to use MSDN, because there are few pages without *serious* errors.

There were hundreds of megs of free space, but alas, no code to check your work!

One thing I like is that the study questions are about the same level of difficulty as the real test. On the sample test I scored 869, and on the real test I scored 842. If you can pass the sample test, you can pass the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work with holes","review":"The book moves you much closer to the objective of passing the exam. I think it is an invaluable tool. However there are holes where the author could have spent more time. The strength of the book is the review questions, exercises and exam questions at end of each chapter. However I found a few of the questions to be ambiguous and I think one of them was even repeated (chapter 4 #16 and #22). You can't go wrong with this book, but you have to be good enough and attentive to read some of the material with a grain of salt.

Got all into it with my just turned 3 year old and felt horrible for exposing him to Fox's cruelty. Seems more appropriate for a young adult book or even adult.

I ended up having to glue them, which is what I sought to avoid in the first place! To achieve optimum results, Talbot suggests using a special iron, which I am not about to buy, given my dubious results so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collage...new approach, not worth it.","review":"This pamphlet was a total rip-off....actually only 43 pages of material and the bookSeemed very dated. Save your money and buy something from the 21st century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific reference and resource!","review":"Although some might consider this more of a thick brochure, rather than a book; that's only because it wasn't \\"padded\\" with extra pages or text to fluff it out. Mr. Talbot's book get's right to the point and gives clear written instructions with illustrations and includes information about where to easily buy the supplies that he mentions. This book has saved me a great deal of time and frustration, especially when it comes to how my pieces might look in the future when the acids from either the papers or the adhesives have changed to an unintended yuk color. Also, his information about how to get a copier whose ink doesn't smear with water-based art supplies, is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revolutionary","review":"This book has totally changed the way I work when I create collages. Don't be put off by the low page count -- there is more information packed into these 55 pages than in the 3 books on collage that I own, combined.This is a technique book, not a book on collage design or color theory. In this book, Talbot battles the biggest challenge for collage artists: once you've got your elements arranged as you want them, you have to pick them up again to apply adhesive -- and then remember how they were arranged in the first place. Talbot solves this problem with the use of readily available materials, and leaves the artist free to create instead of worrying about what goes where.In addition to the technical information, I found the appendix and source list invaluable. Talbot tells the reader how to easily obtain every item that is mentioned in the book, as well as suggesting alternatives. I have not yet seen another book on collage as well planned and thought-out as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected at all","review":"I was hoping for samples of his work and ideas on how he creates his artwork.

At the price Amazon asks, I would highly recommend this product for people of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most addictive games you will ever play!","review":"These games really bring back memories. I never was really into video games until I found these games and got absolutely obsessed with them. I think that this set would be a good start if you've never played the sims games before at all.You can't beat a game and it's seven expansions on four discs for only $40. I also recommend The Sims 2,and the expansion packs The Sims 2 University,The Sims 2 Nightlife, and The Sims 2 Open for Business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sims... LOVE IT","review":"Definitely love, love, LOVE the original Sims game. It's nice to have all the expansions in just 4 discs. The game has its down sides... there are no days of the week, so work and school are every day. This game is also harder to make friends than Sims 2 or 3. Lastly, the graphics are a bit rough and sims don't age up or die. But there is so much content and there are so many different aspects to explore, it's very much worth it! Also, your sims only get fired from their jobs if you miss 2 days in a row. So skip every other day to throw parties and make friends or gain skills, (unless you need the money.) The Makin Magic content is an absolute blast. There are so many spells and charms to cast and create. You can have a pet dragon! It also offers a lot of nostalgia for those of us that played the games when they came out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This didn't work on my PC","review":"I love the Sims in all of their various permutations.

What is in the book is a collection of rare art from Purcell himself, some of which dating back to when he was a little boy drawing cartoons on notebook paper.While the casual fan may not see anything interesting in the pages, the hardcore and the die-hards probably already bought this book simply because of the rarity of being able to see storyboard art from the Freelance Police Saturday Morning Cartoon show, as well as concept art for toys that never got produced for various reasons. The biggest draw to the book would be the concept art for one of the two cancelled Sam & Max game titles prior toSam & Max: Season 1.A must buy for anyone that likes the Freelance Police, and a requirement for anyone who likes to study an artist's sketch collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written and irrelevant.","review":"There's not much in this book that Lessing herself hasn't already said in her autobiographies and in interviews.Klein's obnoxious second-guessing at Lessing's decisions and how she's lived her life is unappealing.

I guess I was unrealistic in my expectations. I didn't like the music and the steps were boring. I guess I have to spend the extra money and get Zumba DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"beginners NOT welcome","review":"Colorful aesthetics, moderately fun and challenging steps. HOWEVER, the video is shot for watching NOT for participating. The timing fluctuates between cha cha, merengue and salsa without notice. Familiarity with each dance does not make it much easier to be successful following the format. Steps are often NOT to the beat. If you like being on beat and in sync with others...this is not the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring routine","review":"I bought this dvd thinking it would be a fun workout, different from what I normally do. However, I got bored doing this dvd. The main motion is swaying your hips. You pretty much do this the whole time while sometimes moving side to side and alternating leg movements. There isn't much varaition to the arm movements at all either. I felt all I was doing was stepping into place with a little extra hip movement.The steps weren't terribly hard to follow, and the energy of the instructor is good. It's about a 35 minute workout total, and there is also a tutorial about 15 minutes long that goes over the steps. I did the tutorial before starting, although I think you could jump right into the workout and still be okay.This isn't a very strenous workout, and it's very repetitive. I do not see myself doing this dvd again and wish I wouldn't have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love Zuma dancing. So this one is great makes your body move and burn those calories. I have quiet a few dance workout tapes and this is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Easy","review":"This is a fun workout. I highly recommend practicing the steps prior to the workout; it really helps to understand what to do with your feet & hips. The instructor step guide is easy to follow---so watch it first. The music is not so great, but it is fun to watch the dancers & try to copy their sexy moves. The workout becomes more fun as you become more comfortable with the steps & add your own Salsa style!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Hot\\"","review":"I work out to this DVD 6-7 times per week. I love it, and it has really helped with toning my body. I look leaner also. I have danced to Salsa for many years, so I am not a stranger to this method of dancing. What I would recommend to those that are not exposed to salsa is to take it slow, and you will get better. I really love this workout DVD. I fully and totally recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tripping over my own feet but loving it!!!","review":"As you can read in the other reviews there is a lot of versatility and fun to this DVD. While it's a work out that feels like you're learning to dance (and believe me.. it's a workout!) I found that I couldn't keep up with the steps at times although I had previewed them first. I wish there could have been a little more explanation as to how the steps were going to go together. That said, I intend to keep using this DVD because of it's great energy. I'll eventually figure out where my feet go and how my arms are supposed to move.I definitely recommend it especially to those who don't want another boring step left, step right dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quick Cardio Workout!!!!","review":"I just love this \\"sizzling salsa\\" workout. Its fast, fun and effective. Works great on those weight training days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dancing Salsa is a better exercise!","review":"I took ballroom dance lessons last year and I found the latin dances to be my favorite. I thought if Salsa which I loved the most is incorporated into exercise, it would be perfect! But when I started the DVD, I was very disappointed. The music was annoying and the steps were very simple, repetitive and boring. For me, dancing salsa with salsa music would be the best exercise and more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really a Dance work out","review":"This video was a great disappointment to me. I no the latin dances and I was really hoping for an exercise routine that incorporated those dances into the workout. After all that is how it is promoted. With the exception of the cha cha move being slightly like the dance there are no real dance moves here. If you are expecting to see the Mambo, Merengue,Samba, and Tango moves they promise you will be disappointed. They are not there. Each move is just a slight variation of the next. In my opinion it is not at all what they claim it is, and it isn't a very good work out. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow; hard on knees","review":"I've had a couple of salsa lessons, and even with that, I found this hard to follow. Her cueing is very poor, so you can't follow her instructions. And to make matters worse, quite often the camera doesn't show the participants' feet so it's very hard to figure out what they're doing by watching.I would steer very, very, very clear of this one if you have knee problems, too. There's a lot of twisting your legs from side-to-side that I found very painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this product at Wal-Mart in a \\"Dance off the Inches\\" Party Pack. This DVD is repetitive and isn't fun. Stella and her crew are all wearing these gaudy outfits that don't match.She is definately perky but to the point I felt ridiculous doing this video. I recommend the workout dvds with Desiree Bartlett instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Different","review":"I'm trying to work in some different things into my exercise and have tried a couple types of dance workouts. I love latin music so this one sounded good. I found this DVD to be alright. I'm a true dance beginner and found this doable but at times a bit too fast and requiring more coordination then I seem to have. I'll try it a couple more times before deciding whether to put it in regular rotation or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizzling Salsa","review":"I did not like this workout at all, if you want to call it that.

You use it to hook up sound sources, like your CD Player, Tape Deck, and Tuner to your amplifier. If you do not have a component system it may not be of much use to you.

Adding a phono input to this pre-amp will require an after-market stand alone unit, and they are not cheap. You can build your own, if you're an accomplished DIYer, but either way, be advised that this unit has no phono pre-amp. Otherwise, it has great sound and just the right amount of input and switches that you're likely to use in the typical home stereo set-up. You may not like that the volume control uses detentes; I find that annoying, so that's why this is 4 Stars. I use this with its sister power amp, the Amp 1. Clean, raw, 3 D, excellent sound stage and separation. Low (undetectable) noise and distortion. Transparent. This preamp has driven Magnepans with an Atlantic Audio sub, and it simply disappears.

Needs a final main amp to work correctly. Good for a den, but not for a bedroom or for low, soft sounds. The regular amp. which is suppose to match up to this preamp, has a cutout switch, which is VERY annoying. It has a auto 0n/Off switch which is suppose to engage the line input constantly, but that does not work very well. Under moderate or loud volume this preamp/amp setup is fine. It's only so so in a bedroom environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control?","review":"I just received my AudioSource pre one/a preamp in the mail. Anxious, I hooked everything up (correctly) and immediately noticed noise coming from my speakers, which resembled speakers that had damaged voice coils. How could this be?

I hooked up my Koss Pro4/AA's via a y-connector out of one set of preamp outs on the back of the AudioSource preamp. To make a long story longer, after finishing this review, I'm shipping this lemon back! BOO- AudioSource! P.S.- I reluctantly gave this item 1 star, but I guess that's where the scale starts!

Clearly by now you know I did not, so I goofed. However, if you want to power an outdoor system or secondary system at home this will do the trick. Let me caution you though make sure you read the specs. I made another boo boo by reading too quickly, I thought it was 100 watts per channel...uh no 100 watts total, i.e. 50 per channel. I kinda blew it on this one and can only blame myself. If you don't need much power and only want to power smaller speakers grab this now. If you have larger speakers go for the next model up with a bit more power. All in all for the price it does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book made no sense.

This sunshade completely keeps her eyes protected. She is so much happier in the stroller now, and you have to love that this shade helps to protect sensitive skin from getting sunburned. I was a little worried that this sunshade would fit on our stroller. We have an all terrain stroller with a tray and I was worried about the shade fitting over the tray. No problem there though. This is such an awesome product. I only wish that I had found it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS","review":"I brought this for my 2nd daughter and love it, it really keeps all the sun off her, and when she is sleeping I just pull it down and its nice and dark in her stroller and the air is still flowing through, unlike when I used to put a blanket over the stroller. It fits great on my jogging stroller also, which has a tiny sunshade, now I can run without the sun blinding her.I really recomend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the Job Done","review":"This shade is basically like a piece of spandex with piping in the front to give it the curved shape - it fit my Graco Metrolite stroller with no problem and can see how this would/should fit any stroller. Really easy to put on/off and adjust if needed. If the sun is pointed right at us, I can easily just pull the shade so it goes lower and then just pull it back when the sun is not in our face so my baby can see more!

It was hard for us to take our dauther for walks during the day because the sun was always getting in her face. I started doing some research for some sort of canopy extender and reviewed a lot of the ones on Amazon. I decided on this one because the reviews/details state it is flexible and large enough to do it's job. We purchased it and have had it on our stroller since the day it arrived. It ties on easily and depending on where/how tight you tie it, it can be adjusted even further to cover part or all of the stroller seat. It also folds up with the rest of the canopy when you push it back, so it stays out of the way when you need it to. The only thing is it does catch the wind a lot easier, but other than that, no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this for our Chicco Cortina stroller!","review":"We live in Southern California, and have season passes to Disneyland so we definitely needed something that could shade our son better. This fits great on the Chicco Cortina stroller. Its a LITTLE annoying trying to get the shade to stay up though when trying to get the baby in and out of the stroller, but its definitely worth it. It ties on, so it can fit any type of stroller. On the Cortina, it goes down almost to the tray and completely enclosed my son, letting him nap easier since it was dark, and protecting him from the sun. Love the mesh sides as well, it really helps to have that open when its so hot outside.

I highly recommend this to anyone who loves Phantom or wants the experience without paying hundreds of dollars for that perfect Broadway seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent audio quality!","review":"I'd had the show's regular DVD for a while, and recently got this blu-ray version. It's definitely worth the $$. The sound quality is impeccable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"I have seen Phantom performed live on stage 4 different times. This DVD provides the viewer with a very up close and personal experience. The costumes, the performers, the sets are all first class. The camera work was excellent. The views up close were better than you might experience while in the best seats in the theater. The view of the stage through the chandelier was special. It was fun to see the actors that played the Phantom over the last 25 years was a special treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Special Treat","review":"This was the most pleasureable dvd that we have viewed. After seeing Phantom 3 times (in London and Broadway) this was so special to us. Having the closed caption available made it possible to hear some of the conversations that were not clear on stage. We purchased 2 and gave one as a gift for another Phantom admirer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantom of the Opera at Royal Albert Hall","review":"I have seen this play in Philadelphia and on Broadway.

I'm not a die hard Phantom fan, but grew up with it, so it will always have a soft spot in my heart. After buying this DVD, I now understand the story better than ever before. I've seen the Phantom of the Opera in person (in California) and was left wanting more. This DVD captures what is hard to see in person. Multiple -decisive- camera angles, exaggerated and beautifully crafted, elaborate costumes. All in top notch, Blu-ray crisp quality. And of course, top notch actors working with one of Webber's finest scripts. You will never see this kind of production live, not even if you were one of the few lucky individuals present in Albert Hall that evening. The shots and scenes portrayed here could only be seen if you flew around the auditorium on a Jet-pack. I look forward to watching this DVD many times, sometimes just for the music alone, other times for the spectacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"ERRRRRRRRRRR","review":"Well, mayabe I am Phantom-ed Out.VEry pretty and of course, beautifully done, but for those of us who discovered the one and only original...anything is a little bit of a let down."},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Phantom is Awesome!!","review":"Thank you so much for this Amazing movie!!

I still get goosebumps when I hear songs like The Music of the Night, All I Ask of You and Past the Point of No Return. And now I have the capability to watch this over and over again in my home, and it won't cost me $80+ a ticket! Ramin and Seirra are brilliant as the Phantom and Christine. A real joy and treasure to watch and listen too. At the end 6-past Phantoms to include our beloved original Phantom - Michael Crawford and Christine - Sarah Brightman join the current cast on stage for some encore songs.

I have seen a few screen versions which I liked, but when I saw this version on PBS, I fell in love all over again! Since purchasing it, I have watched it numerous times and have loaned it to friends (who have now purchased it as well). Unfortunately I have never attended a stage version, but I hope to visit New York City to see it on Broadway. Excellent production as well as a superb cast! Ramin Karimloo, Sierra Boggess, Hadley Fraser to name a few! And of course Andrew LLoyd Weber is a musical genius!

I love the book, I love the movie, more than that, I love the musical. I love Webber's works on the musical so much. I love the smooth, \\"softly, deftly\\" of the music. That's why I was upset with the electric guitar in the The Phantom of the Opera song. I don't know why Webber try to put rock into this opera. Can't understand.As a major fan of POTO I proud to say that I have listened to the original album more times than I can count.I still love this version. The acting is good, the singing is good. I just wish the sound of the electric guitar wasn't in the song that annoying me so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Production","review":"I am not a fan of Phantom of the Opera AT ALL .

I have see Phantom twice at the Curran in San Francisco and listened to the original CD hundreds of time. I have heard many different voices in the lead parts. The three leads at Royal Albert, singing Christine Daae, the Phantom and Raoul were disappointing. To my ear, Lisa Vroman is by far the best Christine, even better than Sarah Brightman. Franc D'Ambrosio does the best Phantom with Michael Crawford a close second. No wonder the SF and LA runs went so long.The acting is very artificial, maybe due to the use of close-ups. Live theater, even from cheap seats, is much better and gets stuck playing in my head. The various singers/actors performances are available on YouTube by bootleg video. Even bootlegged, Lisa Vroman is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful performance","review":"POTO is my favorite show of all-time. I met the entire Broadway cast starring Tom O'Leary as the Phantom many years ago and had a poster signed by everyone in silver paint pen which is proudly framed in my living room. I was too young to see London show with Michael Crawford & Sarah Brightman. <Sigh> The POTO movie was a letdown except for Emmy Rossum's voice, lavish costumes and staging. I didn't think that I'd be blown away by a live performance starring anyone else in the lead roles. I was wrong. Ramin and Sierra are fabulous in the title roles. Both are great actors and possess amazing voices. And isn't Sierra just gorgeous?! Their chemistry together is electric. I also loved how the Phantom kept angrily yelling \\"Sing!!!\\", at Christine. The actor whom portrays Raoul is very believable and sings beautifully. A nice change from actor Patrick Wilson whom was wooden in the film version. Anyhow, buy or rent this DVD and enjoy the show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite musical","review":"I've grew up with Phantom of the Opera when I saw the movie version when I was 11, and I saw Phantom 3 times. 2 in Vegas, and 1 in LA. I've always dreamed of being in the show, and as The Phantom. I felt a connection with him when I saw his disfigurement, and when he desires for his true love. This should be shown to all future musical theatre goers, and to future composers, actors, and actresses. This is THE show to see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife loves it","review":"What can one say, got this for the wife for Christmas, watched it that morning. First time I've ever seen the opera.

I figured it would be okay at best. Most of the times when \\"live\\" plays are filmed the SUCK and I hate them!! The camera does not do a good job of recording live plays.However, with this DVD they did a great job of planning out how to record a live play to actually enjoy on a TV. I was pleasantly surprised.The fact that they recorded it at Royal Albert Hall makes for a fantastic BlueRay to own! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This awesome disc is the justification for my recent new 60\\" LED and sound system.

There was no marketing for this thing. Accidently discovered it. Glad I did...You are right there in stage with this amazing company. Fun to see true talent. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"By FAR the Best Phantom on Video!!","review":"This performance, which is fully staged even though it's a concert performance, is outstanding. It is exceedingly better than the movie performance with an almost \\"delicate\\" phantom. Having seen the Phantom several times on stage and owning the original London cast recoding with Michael Crawford, I was completely let down by the movie version. What a total waste of time the movie version is.This Royal Albert Hall performance is full of energy and really conveys to true love story that it is. While Ramin Karimloo is not Michael Crawford, he is most excellent; and conveys a real man with a broken heart instead of the almost feminine approach of the movie phantom.Buy this one. It will grab you completely, and really shows why the Phantom has been such a phenomenon all over the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Production!!!","review":"I had seen this production on PBS and was very impressed by it. It was so well done and the 2 leads - Ramin Karimbo and Sierra Boggess were outstanding. Not only are they wonderful singers but their acting truly brought the story to life. I was so pleased that the CD included not only the songs but the scenes as well! The special finale with all the previous Phantoms singing was quite a treat. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves this show.One question though: why wasn't Sarah Brightman's solo included? Granted her voice is not as strong as it once was but it was peculiar that her solo was not included."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this cast and this special performance!","review":"This special 25th anniversary performance is amazing.

You won't regret acquiring the DVD and I dare you not to hum and sing something from it every single day for at least 10 days after viewing it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique voice and great tunes","review":"This was the first Chris Rea album I ever heard. I was intrigued by the lower register of his voice, as it gave something extra to the tunes. Fine example of late 70's pop/rock. Better writing than many more popular artists of that period and style.While this isn't his best ever, it is my personal favorite and made me a big fan of his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirby ROCKS!","review":"I love the Kirby anime show.

Together, they have created a great work that seamlessly fuses the didgeridoo with electronic soundscapes.Roach is an absolute master of these soundscapes, and, more to the point for this album, had already produced a magnificent two-disc work inspired by the world of the aborigine, Dreamtime Return. For that, he traveled to and stayed in the midst of the aborigine world in Australia, recording native music and learning much of the aborigine mythos.David Hudson is an acknowledged master of the didgeridoo who met Roach for the first time during those travels. They decided to work together, but, from my perspective, this is the absolute best of their collaborations, a brilliant work of Australian ethno-ambient music.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously spooky","review":"This would make a great CD for Halloween.

I immediately emailed them saying they HAD to release albums by Nick Gilder and City Boy (i'm still waiting for City Boy).Well, it took a long time, but this CD is GREATLY appreciated. Nick Gilder was a standout rocker with a unique sound. If Nick is crankin' out of your system, you aren't going to mistake him for anybody else..About the CD...Nice remastering. The songs sound crisp and clear. A decent selection of songs, but as other reviewers have noted, some glaring ommissions. Some of my favorites that are NOT on the CD: Metro Jets (how did this one get away???)We'll Work It Out (Hello??) Time After Time (McFly...Anybody Home?) Hold On Me Tonight.

My original rim lasted through years and years of hard riding. Maybe I just happened to be the unlucky one that got a bad rim but the bottom line is: I did get a bad one.At least it looks cool.Since it cost me $50 in the store, I'd recommend at least buying this online and saving a few bucks. Actually, I take that back. I can't recommend buying this rim at all.Once again I needed another new rim and was forced to go back to the local shop as I can't wait until I can get one shipped. Don't get me wrong, I love to support local businesses but a difference of $20 means I will only buy local when I'm in a pinch.I guess I'll tear apart and rebuild this one so I will at least have a spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is very wrong here","review":"I understand these things are machine built, but they need to watch the process more closely.

It also assumes \\"tags are good\\" - and provides no evidence of it. So - if you're willing to accept what the authorities tell you without challenge or thinking about it - perhaps this book is for you.From my perspective, the world is full of Java101 books.

For example, in the movie Willy Little, played by Robert Wagner, invents the Sousaphone. In real life Sousa and another man developed it together. Still and all this doesn't detract from the script. Debra Paget has a big role and is gorgeous as ever (I never knew she could dance), Clifton Webb makes a believable Sousa and the music is wonderful. Just enough drama to make it interesting and make you care about the characters.

I bought the 3rd edition right when it was fresh off the press to prepare for the NCEES Structural II exam in April 2006. I didn't take the Structural I exam so I can't say if this book is more tailored to that. However, I have to say I passed in spite of this book. The examples in the book are easy to follow, but for a good portion of them they only cover the easy special cases, not the more elaborate, more complicated variations. For how thin this book is, I think it is outrageously expensive. I was also disappointed that the concrete design aids are not updated to the current code with the revised factors.Another waste of money was the 2003 IBC. They took out all those useful sections from 2000 and just say refer to ASCE-7. You would be fine just to get ASCE-7 for the exam and save some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!","review":"The price was good.

In any case, after fiddling with it and ten checking the results with my gauge, it came out pretty sorry.I then reverted and used the gauge that came with the jointer and was able to adjust them all quickly and easily and they came out flat and the same.

There is no way any Scottish/Irish Mc/Mac surname can be changed to \\"daughter of\\" just to make it feminine.

Moreover, the writer's attempt to give alternate language versions frequently falls flat, especially in Spanish. I speak Spanish fluently and have spent a considerable amount of time in Latin America, and I have never seen many of the spellings she says are \\"Spanish\\" (e.g., there are no double 's' or double 'n' in Spanish words).

The really useful features: 2 alarms allow weekend/weekday times without constantly resetting, recurring alarm without having to keep resetting (i.e. turning off alarm each day resets for next day), alarm sound comes on gradually to avoid startling you awake, large easy-to-read numbers, separate nap alarm (alarm only, no music), indicators on the front show whether alarm(s) are set and whether set for music or alarm. The only drawback for this clock is that the large digital numbers are *ridiculously* BRIGHT... almost like a nightlight, and I can't find a dimming feature. I've had to angle the clockface so that it is almost perpendicular to the bed. That way I can still read the numbers, but it doesn't 'shine' directly at my face while trying to go to sleep. If you can live with that one drawback, it's a great clock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this if you ever leave North America","review":"This clock seemed to have everything. I love the fact that I can set the length of the snooze time. But otherwise it is not the phone for you if you ever leave North America. Even though it supposedly sets the clock automatically when you are in mainland US, and lets you switch time zones between Eastern to Hawaii -- it won't let you switch to time zones in Europe or Asia. So when you go overseas, you have to set the time by hand.Because the automatic setting is unreliable and usually only happens in the middle of the night, you are still using the manually set time when you come back to North America. If you set the clock for 9:00 PM manually and set the alarm for 6:00 AM, the phone might automatically reset to the auto-time and in a different time zone, thereby changing the actual alarm time and missing your flight. I haven't missed my flight, but almost did yesterday, hence my warning to other potential customers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unpredictable","review":"I liked the clear numbers but trying to set it is a nightmare, the back buttons are too close together & too easy to misuse.

Could be possible I got a lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after only a few months, poor design.","review":"At first I really liked this clock, it functions very well, but it broke after a few short months of use. It is designed so that you press down and back to hit \\"snooze\\", which is actually pretty difficult to do when you're asleep-- a simple button is much easier-- and when I did this one time it bent all the way back and snapped off the base. It won't even stand up without the base so it's useless. Also the folding design is good for travel in theory, but all the buttons are on the back and it folds toward the front, so all the buttons are exposed when it's folded. Thus the alarm could easily get turned on while in your bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"great travel clock","review":"This is the second one of these i have bought. The first one i must have had for 8 years and then the buttons wore out and became unresponsive. I use it both as my primary alarm clock and a travel clock.Love the self setting, self adjusting time.

I have had this clock a little more than a month and the snooze function has already broken. Because all of the control buttons are on the back of the clock, and all of them look and feel the same, it is very difficult to turn off the alarm unless you are in a brightly lit room.

Skrape do that very well. These songs are all heavy, thickly guitar layered songs. Some fast some a little slower. But the part I like the best is the singing. Very rarely does the singer break down into \\"scream your head off bloody murder.\\" That type of \\"singing\\" just begins to grate on you after a while. But this CD has actual singing, and it's done (fairly) well. I won't say he's a vocal genius, but it sounds good. The choruses of the songs all have good melodic quality to them, which is sometimes hard to do with such heavy music.Overall, a great metal CD with melodic choruses.

After listening to the entire CD, I was completly shocked at how good it was.Initially, I was hopeful that there would be at least 2-3 decent songs on the CD, and although you've never met me, trust me on this: every song on this CD is amazingly good. ...Some of the best songs are \\"What You Say\\", \\"Waste\\", \\"Sunshine\\", and \\"Kill Control\\".The music style is pure hard rock / heavy metal that doesn't let up. Although I am not opposed to rap-metal, I'll inform you that there is not a trace of rap on this album - just extremely solid, heavy music. If you like hardcore rock / metal bands like Machine Head, Utraspank, Nothingface, Factory 81, Godsamck, get this album.

Don't get me wrong, i love this entire cd, those songs are just the ones that stick out as really good and \\"hit-worthy\\".

At least try a good nu-metal band like System of a Down, Deftones, or Mushroomhead. Then get some real metal like Megadeth, Children of Bodom, Opeth, Black Sabbath, Pantera, Tool(I consider them metal, especially after 10000 Days), Slayer, Iron Maiden, Death, well you get the point.

The counter-proposal that design by an intelligent super-being might explain the same physical evidence better is an intriguing one, but it is in its infancy at this point, and it has by no means displaced the natural selection hypothesis in the way that modern medical practices have replaced bloodletting and charmed amulets in the treatment of physical illness.

From almost the very beginning of the story the author browbeats you with the one clue that if you know anything about flowers you will know who did the crime and how. There is very little suspense and no character development and by the end you couldn't care less if the beautiful (an adjective repeated constantly) Countess Zorah Rostova did the crime or not.Referencing the audio version, the narrator does an admirable job with the narration and the male voices but he wasn't very good when it came to portraying the female characters lending a, if not intended, comedic slant to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak entry in solid series","review":"Talk about giving the ending away in the first chapters--it was, as my sister Becky says--fore-clobbering.

I liked that Monk did not really appreciate Hester as he should, and I liked his indecision about who to support in the slander trial.The centerpiece notion of forgotten European history worked very well.If you too have enjoyed Perry's books, but never really loved them, then you might enjoy Weighed in the Balance.

I did not realize then, as I do now, how important it is to understand how the eugenics movement in Germany and the U.S. had a profound effect on the involuntary sterilization of the mentally disabled. I believe the history of the eugenics movement must be reviewed in light of Tipper Gore's recommendations for changes in community mental health care through PACT programs which the National Aliance of Mental Illness (NAMI) is now proposing to state legislators. The PACT model is essentially a biomedical model, with specific social control features, deciding the fate of people with severe mental illnesses.

For these reasons and my belief that the book itself could have been half the size it is, with far fewer pages (large, sparse type on informational pages), and therefore less costly, I would not recommend purchasing this book.All that being said, there are some cute patterns in the book.

Some important piece of information must have been lost from design to marketing.The bag BARELY fits the camera and its remote. You can squeeze in an extra CF card, but the added pressure against the G6 just doesn't make me very comfortable. It is VERY EASY to trip the power switch, meaning that the lense will begin to extend inside the case, where it has zero room to open. I suspect the switch can easily be activated while the camera is carried within the bag as well.All in all, I'm very disappointed.

The real gems I found on cross country trips were a cheese factory in Wisconsin or an ice cream shop in Iowa. Luckily I found this book before my second cross country trip. It was really great. It gives about 8 different 2-lane highway routes usually stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic or from Canada to the Southern tips of the US. It doesn't cover everywhere I want to go, but it's great if you're going on a long road trip... or if you live near one of the 2-Lane Highways in the book.

Between this book, and the people we met, I learned so much about American culture.It was the time of our lives - and we owe it to our compass: Road Trip USA!ps- if you like chili dogs - YOU MUST check out the cafe on page 581!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Negative","review":"I returned this book because I found it to be very negative.For someone who enjoys to travel and loves to find unexplored (by me) roads, I looked forward to recieving this book. What a dissapointment. This author was very negative and had something to say on just about every road he wrote about. For example, instead of talking about the virtues of Plantation Alley, the author calls it Chemical Corridor. Yuck.There are many lovely books available about traveling and a good map will provide you with many roads unexplored. I would suggest that you skip this book altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blind Man Traveling","review":"I thought this sounded like an interesting book, but then I decided to read what Jensen had to say about where I live - Athens, Ohio - which is on US 50. I'm guessing the author never really visited Athens, because there is no possible way that he could have thought Athens to be pleasant, attractive, and progressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Hopes Fade Fast","review":"I had the pleasure of uncovering this book at the AWP conference a few years ago, and, with all the praise it received there and all the reviews which gave it Faulknerian comparisons, I grew excited about having time to read it. I began it immediately and my disappointment was almost as immediate. Though the language did in fact remind me of Faulkner and, more recently, of Cormac McCarthy and Jeffrey Lent, in \\"Bloodroot\\" it was forced and the hand of the author is too present. Also, the dialogue shifts are abrupt and the obvious use of dialogue to propel the narrative weakens its read, for the speech doesn't appear natural. Ultimately, I'm surprised it won its award and that it received such praise. Though the plot is thoughful, it is awkwardly presented and the rough language overshadows the narrative."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thrilling Frontier Adventure","review":"For those of you who love to read western adventure stories, \\"The Black Jacks,\\" written by the frontier specialist Jason Manning, is one that must not be skimmed over on the bookshelf. The bloodbath in Texas includes as much action as the movie \\"Braveheart,\\" and almost as much drama as \\"Titanic.\\" This great novel can keep one reading all night due to the numerous cliffhangers. Jason Manning wrote this terrific book involving many characters, which of course leads to great conflict on top of the huge battle itself. I definitely liked this book a lot to the point where I am searching to read another title in Manning's great frontier series. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a good adventure story with a lot of action and drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blender is a headache","review":"I bought this blender because it was a great price and looked like a good product. It is the worst blender I have ever used, or even heard about! It is very finicky: it takes a lot of effort to get the cover completely on, and the cover must be locked in place for the blender to start. I've spent way to much time standing in front of my blender placing and replacing the cover in order to get it to work.Add to that, the item is not normally durable. When I was removing it from the mount, the whole plastic handle came off. I would never recommend this item to anyone. It is a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthed at all!","review":"I bought this blender, and couldn't get it working until some long efforts. I basically had to press very hard on the top of it to make it working, but then I couldn't stop it.

Blender comes with 2 attachments, which just like the container and lid, are plastic. That is the main drawback. It chopped ice just fine and otherwise works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last very long","review":"It has been a long time since I bought this and I can't remember how long it lasted or why I didn't return it, but it did not hold up to the rigors of making smoothies. It might be okay if you're just making baby food or very soft products, but don't count on it if you're going to put ice in your smoothie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It pays to read the reviews...........","review":"Wish there had been some product reviews available when I bought this blender.

If you like what you see, pick this one up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So sweet, gorgeous and innocent looking","review":"I ordered this necklace as a birthday present for my 18-year old cousin. I was looking for something really small and \\"innocent\\" looking. And I've found just that. The picture show here doesn't do the necklace justice. It is really beautiful, with a really thin and smooth golden chain. The pearls are very lustrous, but the diamond is not the whole \\"dot\\" that you see in the picture here. It is surrounded by white gold(?) metal accents to look bigger, but is still very attractive. Combined with the matching earrings, this is a perfect addition for anyone, especially those who are looking for small, not \\"yelling-at-you\\" jewelry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bennett Garmin DVD","review":"This is my first video from this developer.

This flashlight however is terrible as far as brightness and I wouldn't even recommend it on land.One thing to remember when buying a dive light is, you get what you pay for, if you're paying under $100 for it then it's almost guaranteed to disappoint. Another point to remember is, aim for 300 lumens or above. Safe diving!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather listen to Vanilla Ice (that tell you how I feel?)","review":"Don't buy this CD.

There was no suspense and the basis of the \\"mystery\\" was not believable. Even the dialogue was weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Me Whisper Plugs For Products","review":"Ms Clark is a producer and writer for CBS News. The news on TV has become a vehicle for advertising; perhaps this is where the author got her idea that advertisements should be generously sprinkled throughout the book. She devotes two pages plugging glass ornaments by Christopher Radko. FAO Schwarz gets three pages. Jaguar and Range Rovers get honorable mention. Various restaurants get plugs. Cookbooks, magazines and TV shows are also well represented. One character is murdered wearing a Pashmina shawl. Liquor is not generic, only Glenlivet, Dom Perignon, Veuve Clicquot and, the common touch, Budweiser. The blurbs go on and on.The sad thing is that the book is otherwise interesting. The writing, while not of Pulitzer quality, is good. Perhaps in future books Ms Clark will imagine herself working for PBS and can the commercials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teach children self worth through Ida","review":"Ida Claire comes to life through the delightful illustrations of Sunny Dai. The accomplished storyteller/author, Louis Rowles,creates a story of human character in this promising children's book. Valuing one's self as a worthy person, one of life's most important lessons, is the underlying theme to be gleaned through Ida Claire's adventure.Through ear pleasing rhyme and informative vocabulary, the reader follows Ida's quest for popularity with the town's folk. Only through being herself does Ida find true happiness. What better way to teach young people about acceptance in today's seemingly foreboding world?Great book for fostering phonemic awareness in preschool children and teaching the literary element of theme to students of all ages. A must for character education instruction!Definitely a 5 star book whose popularity is sure to rival the classics of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Episodes Are Full OF White Dust","review":"Until Warner starts releasing the shorts chronologically like Disney did with the Tin Editions I won't but them anymore.

I read this book cover to cover, then read it one more time and passed it on to my daughter. I'm going to buy a copy for my Mom, and one for each of my sisters.

The positive reviews obviously mean it works for some people but take my advice and buy only one can to try. It's expensive and it's so horrible that you may not be able to stomach it.

Thank goodness a co-worker gave me some to try before I bought any. Tried the first serving with filtered water, eeekkkk, had to gag it down. It tastes like sawdust! I used a magic bullet for 5 minutes to blend it and it still settled at the bottom.2nd serving I used 1% milk and 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder. Not much improvement.Before I tried it I was going to do the 14-day starting phase. No way I could gag this down 3 times a day for 14 days, let alone ONE day!Really wish it tasted and dissolved better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I bought this because I am very sensitive to sugar cane and corn syrup and this has neither. Do not think that because this is made with honey that it won't taste bad. It is horrid. Another reaction I had with this is a increased appetite. All I want to do all day when I drink this is to eat. It is really not like me at all. I usually have a low appetite. I don't know how this could help loose weight when I have constant cravings and a desire to eat all day. I am very grateful that I only bought the one can to try. I will not buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent item for Diabetes","review":"I find the product is exactly as advertised. It is an excellent supplement for someone with Diabetes. My only difficulty is getting over the taste. If you mix with flavored items like milk, its cuts the bad taste. Its not really bad like medicine. It just tastes like it smells, kind of like flour would taste if you mixed with water and drank it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!!!! Great Product!!!!!!","review":"Saw this advertised in a helth magazine. I have tried many protien powders before, nothing ever turned out to be something I would stick with. This product attracted me because it has a well documented history for over 25 years. That says something to me! I also liked the fact that it was all natural, and I do not need a chemistry degree to interpret the ingredients. Many have commented on the taste in many reviews over the years. The taste is actually quite good to me. I do enjoy adding organic raw cacao powder (1TBSP) to get my chocolate fix. I am following the exact guide as given in the cannister. I had been fasting prior to this product arriving, so I was ready to dive right in to replacing my meals with the product. I have no jitters, no hunger pains in between my drinks, I am drinking tons of water while using, and herbal tea. This product gives me a ton of energy!!!

I came across this product and read so many good reviews that I decided to give it a try. I have now purchased this product several times, and continue to use it for breakfast at least, and more on days when I feel that I need a little more control - like, when I splurged the day before!

The first time I tried it I thought it tasted odd (mixed it with soy milk0, now I switched over to vanilla almond milk (40 calories per serving) and I cannot get enough of the taste. It's addicting. I do not add anything to it, 6 tablespoons of the mix, 12 ounces of almond milk and mix it in a shaker cup that is all. The first 3 days I did 3 of these and 3 snacks and I lost weight right away. Now I do 2 of these and one small lunch meal (and snacks). The problem is that now it seems it doesn't fill me up as much, probably because my body got used to it? I do not know, but I still drink them and I'll drink a lot of water in the meantime. Also wanted to say that usually these kinds of protein powders give me an upset stomach the first few days but Almased never did. I always feel good after I drink it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"Almased does work to lose weight and it does keep my blood sugar levels from spiking/dropping. The taste is not the best and I have mixed it with various liquids like water, different juices and milk. I like it best with almond milk, and the almond milk only adds 60 calories per serving. Expensive, yes, but worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good protein drink","review":"I bought the Almased Protein drink and the Turbo-Protein Diet book. There is a discrepancy between what Almased says is a single serving and the book. 8 Tablespoons on the Almased box and about 8 teaspoons in the book. 8 Tablespoons per drink sounded too much for me, so I went with the books recommendation. It was more weight specific, and gave a formula for determining the servings size based on your weight goal. The drink tastes much better made with milk (I used 1%) than with water. I did only the drink three times a day for four days and lost 6 pounds. So far I have not seen an improvement to my metabolism, but it may be too soon to tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely works and will continue to use!","review":"I did the two week bikini plan and at first it's very difficult to get use to drinking only the Almased for the first week but once you get through the first 3 days it's easier. Plus, you just have to look at the scale and see the results, that's motivational enough to keep on track. I ended up really liking the drink and continue to use it for breakfast and sometimes lunch.

It was awful tasting, no matter how I tried to flavor it. It made me want to gag, and it really made me feel wierd the days I took it. No matter what, the only healthy way to lose weight is eat less, eat BETTER food, and exercise more. And I saw no boost in my energy level or metabolism.

I had read ads in magazines about Almased being recommended for diabetics, so I thought I would try it. I put it in light Almond milk, used a blender and put in a couple of ice cubes, I think it tastes like a malt, you can also add a little cinnamon extract and it's even better!! It has the amino acids that most protien shakes don't have. The difficult part was the first 3 days when it recommends having nothing but the shakes 3 times a day and some broth. I have only lost a couple of pounds, but I have never been a breakfast eater and I can drink a shake with no problem. I feel that the 25 grams of soy protien is really healthy.

When alarm goes off I sometimes need to unplug it from the outlet or it won't stop.

The unique thing about this is that it was written by a man who was nothing more than a minor clerk in the government of Florence. The book's success stems from the fact that he made fun of well-known political personages in Government. Then as now people love to hear gossip of well-known people. Because of his rapier wit, Machiavelli's reputation is rather unsavoury, and the term \\"Machiavellian\\" is not a complementary term. This book is worth a read though. It's a quick, short book, but Machiavelli covers a lot of territory in it.

In it, he breaks down different styles of ruling, different military defenses, and many other things, all the while using historical examples. One of the reasons it has remained so popular is because of Machiavelli's lack of morals included in his ideas.

With followers such as Clinton, Kissinger and Nixon, \\"the Prince\\" has proven that ideology from the 16th century still holds true today. This book provides a no-nonsense displaced approach to politics where many decisions based on personal feelings lead to errors. Machiavelli was seen as the devil because he spoke out against the church as just another form of government. he was punished for his views primarily because he spoke the truth.

For, as he argues, they will always rise against a ruler who would oppress them.From such a recommendation, is it not apparent that Mr. Machiavelli would like to see mankind enslaved, rather than free? Despite this, Machiavelli is often praised for his candidness and pragmatism!And what does Mr. Machiavelli seek from the Prince in exchange for the \\"gift\\" of his advice?

I agree too with the reviewer who said that the photos were sometimes several pages away from the relevant text, but I think that is manageable, and caused by the fact that there are a lot of photos, and sometimes one paragraph of text describes several pages of photos. The text would be a sentence per page if it was more closely linked.The content is superb. I learned a lot and it was all explained clearly.The book is well written by someone who knows how to explain things. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your Face!!!!","review":"Prepare to get your face rocked off!

It's good to see Hispanic characters that are not stereotypes. Sweet story line without being too predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad 2nd Disc Audio","review":"Well disc 1 of 2 on this Blu-Ray set was great. Good video, but not Blu-Ray quality and great digital sound. Disc #2, well can't say anything but that it will not load after repeated tries. Could be that stacking two discs on one spindle wouldn't be a great idea, but this one was on the bottom.UPDATE: In taking the #2 disc out to check for dust, scratches, etc., I find a really, really thin piece of tape stuck to the playing surface. Removed it, clean the disc and it plays. Sorry, but you still lose a couple of stars because of the tape stuck to the disc, the lack of audio on the bonus track, and the unthinkable stacking of one disc on top of another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality DVD","review":"I concur with Luke's review, everything he says goes double for me. DVD's both are very scratched up and on the second DVD there is no sound for one of the key segments when they are jamming in the dressing room. Amazon should not sell this specific product. I thought maybe Luke's came from a different seller under the umbrella of Amazon but when I got my DVD in Early Sept. 2012, it was the same poorly packaged DVD and to boot mine did not even have tape to hold the DVD's in place. I will not go through the trouble of sending it back. I ordered another copy of an older version release which cost me 25 dollars instead of the 17 I just spent but hopefully all the sound is present and the dvd\`s are in good shape. Please Amazon remove this from your buyer list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it used to be!","review":"Though there is much great technical playing and the band is extremely tight, the soul is lacking. Without Betts the band has virtually no versatility. Trucks plays with no emotion and his solos seem to be an endless screech with little or no taste. Haynes slide playing blows Trucks away. The new songs are not memorabile. Without Dickey the band is just a second rate blues band riding on a name and past reputation. The best song on the tape is Gregs Old Before My Time, it's loaded with soul. Disappointed without Dickey!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atencion es una reedición","review":"Es imprescindible informar sobre las reediciones este DVD es del 2003, lo compre pensando que era material nuevo, porque aparecia como novedad.

Yeah, Dickey is incredible, and I've actually seen him more times than the Allmans, but Derek will play his, and Warren's, socks off any day of the week!!! Get this DVD, it will change the way you look at slide guitar and jam music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friggin Awesome!","review":"Allmans fans old and young alike will LOVE this one! Outside of a few misses by Derek Trucks, a youngster who's on his way up-the-chain, this is the most vivid performance yet. I got this for X-Mas '03 and watch it religiously. Warren Haynes has done a wonderful job keeping the sound on course with tradition, as well as adding a few new licks to make it fresh. Greg looks and sounds the best in years. And the very best part is that everyone is into the sound...and it shows masterfully. BUY THIS!If the Allman's were a baseball team, the \\"Hittin The Note\\" Tour (captured on CD/DVD), would make them, \\"Comeback kids of the year!\\"The Allman's are back baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I bought this as a gift for my husband for Christmas.

This is a two DVD set. The first is pure music. The second starts with One way out which is one of my favorites and then continues with fun to watch, behind the scenes filming and interviews. I would have given this product 5 stars except for the poorly designed packaging. I bought this new and the DVDs arrived floating around in the package and scratched up. I returned the package and the second set arrived in the same way. All in all, a great DVD capturing the live performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get over Dickey Betts & Allen Woody - then watch!","review":"WOW! This one is gonna get watched quite a bit. The ABB Live at Great Woods (with Allen Woody & Dickey Betts) on VHS, aka 1990 rules. But, Live at the Beacon 2003 on DVD with all the trippy lighting & Derek Trucks playen lead with Haynes blew my mind. The audio/ video quality of this DVD is super too.Oteil Burbridge does a good job on bass, but I still miss Allen Woody, he left us all in 2000. Also, it's gonna take awhile for me to get over NOT having Dickey with the band. Oh well, got to move on.Old timers Gregg Allman, Jaimoe, and Butch Trucks, Warren Haynes & Marc Quinones are still with the band & play their hearts out. So anyways, if you like the ABB, GET THIS NOW. They haven't slowed down a bit. Un-fricken believable. This band is still one of the best around after more than 35 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the story, or for the pictures","review":"A very short picture book, but one with an emotional thread tapped by both the author and illustrator. Suitable for adults as well as children. Its only fault is that it is perhaps too short.A statue to commemorate one war is uprooted by a tree planted to commemorate another. When the tree is cut down by the council, it deeply affects a family whose own roots lay in both conflicts.Shaun Tan's illustrations are amazing and in comparisson to 'The Rabbits' show an incredible diversity in his work. Like The Rabbits, the illustrations in this book are powerful and emotional, full of texture and detail. If you are Australian or have been there, you will recognise the shapes, colours and sense of light. If you aren't from those parts, you will be taken on a ourney of even richer discovery.Add it to a collection of Shaun Tan illustrated works and your appreciation will be even richer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Washington Post Review","review":"\\"...these pieces (Reger's Variations and Fugue on a Theme of Mozart) have been recorded fairly often though never in better performances than this...the real surprise comes from Reger's transcriptions of Bach's Brandenburg Concertos No. 3 and 5. This performance establishes the value of these transcriptions as substantial art in their own right.

However, the metal finish is not bronze as stated, it is mottled brown and green with whitish highlights as if you left metal polish on it.

Better photos are definitely needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mine looked like factory seconds","review":"I ordered two of these great Fiesta handled carafes in black. I plan to use them for serving pieces as well as for accent pieces. Black is hard to come by at the local retail outlets in my area so I had to order mine without the benefit of scrutinizing the quality of finish before purchase. I have noticed at the retail places that blemishes often show up on the pieces. I was not happy when I received my carafes and both of them had glaze skips (where the white under the glaze shows through) as well as scratches in the glaze (which I have never seen before and can't imagine what happened to put them there). In my opinion these pieces should have been culled at the factory and sold as seconds. I love the pieces, I'm just dissappointed with the quality of the finish. I also received a black covered butter which was blemish free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"The product is not quite as orange as it looks on the website, but I like it none-the-less.

Lately I had been choosing books that I could not finish because they were too slow (and I hate that), but this book was not one of those! This was a great page turner that kept me reading & interested till the very end. I was literally up at 2 and 3am reading this & I work full time & have an infant daughter. And of course there's a cliff hanger that'll keep me reading the other books till who knows when! But I love it. I'll definitely be checking out his other novels.I gave it 4 stars b/c towards the end it did drag out, but still good nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pendergast saga","review":"Well done murder mystery in the fashion of Sir Conan Doyle.

It was not a page turner for me, but I never hit a slow point in the book, I was always able to pick up the book and read it. I would think 100% of readers out there who enjoy thrillers will find satisfaction from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to read Preston/Child","review":"Preston/Child are such marvelous writers, it's important to do them justice. You want to make sure you get the full effect of Diogenes' (dare I say it) diabolical plot.Here's how it should go. Get \\"Brimstone\\", \\"Dance of Death\\", and \\"Book of the Dead\\". Put them by your reading chair, but do not open them.Clear your calendar--call in sick, take vacation days, whatever you need to do. Check for sufficient provisions for several days--whatever your reading food of choice is. Make peace with your family, insure they have enough food and clean laundry to tide them over, (does not work with young children) and explain that you will be incommunicado for a while. If necessary, go shopping. Have a talk with your pets (does not work with cats) and make arrangements to have them fed and watered.Now, with a clear conscience, open \\"Brimstone\\". Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun as always","review":"This is another fantastic adventure featuring agent Pendergast, love the narrative, the detailed descriptions of places. Recommended to Preston/Child fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining read from Preston & Child","review":"This book was very entertaining. I like most of what Preston & Child write, and I'd say this one ranks up there with \\"Relic,\\" which is my favorite of their works. A fascinating premise with baffling murders, interesting characters, and of course the inimitable Agent Aloysius Pendergast, who I just love. Great book; I definitely recommend it, especially for Preston & Child fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Modern Sherlock Holmes","review":"Agent Pendergrast and his sidekick D'Agosta are definitely the modern version of Holmes and Watson. I read every one of the Lincoln/Child books as soon as they come out and have not been disappointed yet. This one is perhaps the best with a seemingly supernatural twist that requires the investigative duo to travel to Italy in search of the clues. The suspects are all odd and interesting. The plot will keep you guessing until the very end and even then the reader is left hanging. I hope Lincoln & Child get the next book out very soon. I can't wait much longer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Speaker from other books in the series (audio book)","review":"Why do speakers change in a series of books? I am not even saying that this one is not as good as Scott (ok, high score to beat), but he is very different and once we are used to Pendergast speaking in a ceratin voice...There is a reason why the same characters play the same role in a series of films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good action ... only an OK story...","review":"Agent Pendergast is just too eccentric for my tastes, I guess. He seems to know everything about everything, has unbelievable luck, and I just can't be made to care about him. There are some nice twists and turns in the story, that keep you guessing.. but the ultimate 'cause' of some very interesting and bizzare deaths that appear to be Satan himself, was ultimately a real letdown for me. I felt like I was missing 'something' the entire story because I'd not read any of the previous Agent Pendergast stories... and there are lots of references that probably would have made a lot more sense to me (or that I'd care about) if I had... and Preston leaves you hanging at the end ridiculously just to set up another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff -","review":"Normally, I enjoy Preston/Child books. This was a very disappointing read in comparison to other Preston/Child books. The premise is very interesting - devil collecting his dues or spontaneous combustion? Unfortunately the story just plods along. Too much filler existed between the action scenes, and Agent Pendergast is actually boring in this book. I only made it a little past the half-way point and I'm skipping pages. Please, do yourself a favor and read other Preston/Child books like, The Relic or my favorite, Thunderhead which have stronger plot lines and more interesting characters.."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-hyped, and as far from good writing as one can get!!!","review":"it's been awhile since i've read a preston/child offering, but my recollection of Relic and Thunderhead is that both were far more literate and left no loose ends...wish i could say the same for Brimstone, which began to annoy me from the first few chapters. Another reviewer has allready noted the problem with Constance (from Cabinet of Curiosities) but the omission of detail regarding her presence in wren's and pendergast's lives is nowhere near as aggravating as the HORRENDOUS dialogue.what is meant to pass as coarse repartee among the various men in blue falls terribly flat as do the authors' repetitive word choices; if i had a nickel for every time the word \\"cadaverousness\\" appeared, i'd be a wealthy woman, although i suppose points could be given for using it as a descriptor of people AND places.overall, this book disappointed me. word to the wise...ignore the blurb on the dust jacket; wait for the paperback, if you bother at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"Sorry, but this one dragged too slowly for me. I generally like Preston/Child's books, and this one had a GREAT premise. Maybe I was expecting too much. It seemed to fly off in a dozen directions, taking forever to get back around to the parts I was interested in, namely, the Devil coming for his bought-and-paid-for souls. I thought the logic was weak in many places. For example, the protagonists follow a millionaire around the world and break into his compound, based on very weak evidence that he may have information about a murder. Since a huge chunk of the story was about their pursuit and I didn't buy the pursuit in the first place, I found it tedious to keep reading. I kept thinking, it's almost there, almost the story I wanted it to be--with foreign locales, historical tidbits that tied into the present, interesting characters--but ultimately, it let me down. I think it was trying to be a bigger story than it needed to be, and the authors just couldn't keep it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pendergast strikes again.","review":"I am an avid fan of Preston/Child. I read everything they wrote. This one is not one of the best but if you are a fan, it's a definite read because without reading it, you won't enjoy the Dance of Death (next one).Buy the paperback. It's not worth the hardcover unless you buy used one cheap from ebay or amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"The story (what I read of it) was okay, but the language was so bad that I skipped over about 1/3 to 1/2 of the book. I was interested in how it turned out, so I read the ending. It was only semi-satisfactory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"If you're a Preston-Child fan, buy this book, you won't be disappointed. The pace is fast for the most part, although it tends to slow down a bit midway through. The character development is great, D'Agosta is back, and Pendergast is human and vulnerable. So far my favorite has been \\"Relic\\" (I have yet to read \\"Cabinet of Curiosities, however. These authors have not disappointed me yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible prose combined with cliche dialogue","review":"While it is very well researched, this book is cliche and boring. The plot requires you to not only suspend disbelief but to completely ignore it.The dialogue is cliche cop-talk, and the descriptions are juvenile. I endured this only because I assumed it would get better towards the end--it didnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRIMSTONE","review":"Glad I finished it in one day. It's tough holding ones breath that long.Although Pendergast is becoming an almost 'Bond' like superhero with Houdini escapes he is still barely believable.Can't wait for the appearance of the brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, Not Scary.","review":"I have been a fan since \\"Relic,\\" and I have to say that I thought \\"Brimstone\\" was a bit slower paced than the others.There is just too much dialogue. I kept waiting to get to the scary, intense part. It happened maybe once. Then I kept wondering if they were setting up characters and changing the tone of their stories. Perhaps the indestructible Pendergast and his sidekick are the modern day Holmes and Watson?I wasn't thrilled or scared. The whole set up of the story is okay; but it really doesn't go much into the whole aspect of \\"Brimstone.\\"PS Since others are pointing out discrepancies, I noticed that D'Agosta had a daughter, Isabella, in \\"REliquary.\\" Woops!But don't worry. They are still great authors and not every story has to be excellent. \\"Relic\\" and \\"Thunderhead\\" scared the pants off me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Money","review":"This is certainly not a stellar novel. But it is solid, and above all, long. With hardcovers being so expensive nowadays, you'll get your money's worth with Brimstone. The Pendergast character is really not to be taken too seriously, but that's part of the fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"If a protagonist has no way out","review":"I always looked forward to the next novel of Preston & Child, but this one was dissapointing. The mysteries are to obvious except for the motivation of the evil genius. Furthermore integration of a bored wealthy bonvivant, an illegal weapon deal, James Bond like production plants, intrusions in deserted factories and ancient italian nobility is simply too much; even for Preston and Child. Up till now i liked the twisting of technological fiction, reality, crime and some elements of horror as a good read. But this is overdone and sometimes even \\"unwanted\\" funny. I think it is always a problem to create a hyper-super hero like Pendergast, because he has no way to develop. Consequently the setting must become more and more absurd and unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh how the mighty have fallen","review":"I really loved \\"Relic\\" and have followed these two ever since. I was pretty disappointed with this installment. Pendergast is just becoming a ludicrous figure, eccentric to the point of utter unbelievability. These books are becoming a parody of their former thrillers. It seems to me that the works of every extremely popular author just tend to deteriorate over time. This book is still better than some I've read, but is very long winded and I am having the hardest time involving myself in the story. I will finish it since I am about 3/4 of the way through, but if I knew how bad this was going to be, I wouldn't have started it in the first place.
