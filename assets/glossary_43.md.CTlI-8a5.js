Although I wish the author had gone into more detail on a few of his memories, I found following the unfolding recesses of Hallas' mind gripping and eerie at the same time. No false plot, no literary mechanics -- just one man, a tape recorder, and a ten-year-old mystery of what is the \\"truth.\\"This should be required reading in any college class that deals with Vietnam or its aftermath. This is as close as you can get to real without being crouched in the mud beside them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put this one on your \\"Must Read\\" list","review":"The book was well written and kept me wanting to read more. Everytime I went to put it down to go to sleep, I picked it back up again and continued to read. For anyone that has ever wondered what it would have been like to be a soldier in Vietnam, this will answer your questions. It is delivered with honesty and gut wrenching detail at every turn of the page. Our young men that went of to fight the Viet Cong were brave and courageous in the line of fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"includes positions hurtful for those with back problems","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. I bought it specifically because I wanted to continue with Pilates even with two bulging disks. Unfortunately, this book includes positions that my physical therapist said are most stressful on the spine. He said never to use the \\"V-shape\\" position and that very position appears on several pages of this book. The book includes the basic Pilates exercises that probably contributed to my back injuries in the first place. My therapist had recommended a Pilates class taught by physical therapists. I could not take that class and was hoping this book would be along those same lines. It was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great entry-level text for cranky backs","review":"I had purchased Ungaro's Body in Motion and Siler's Pilates Body to begin doing pilates, as they were generally the most respected texts. But my back couldn't handle the most basic level of some of the introductory exercises. This book, however, along with King and Green's Back Strengthening Workout, has given me a sequence of exercises and modifications that (I can already feel after two weeks of use) will get me where I want to be. The introduction to this book is a little too technical on anatomical detail, and the Ungaro and Siler books are superior in terms of illustration and textual guidance at the advanced levels, but without this I'd be quitting and/or hurting before I ever got going with Pilates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic value.","review":"This is a great sleeping bag.

The writing is exactly the same but the storyline isn't. This book clearifies somethings and shows what Acorus was like before Legacies, Darknesses, and Sceptors. Mykel and Alucius are very similar characters in the way they think and act. Also, the author takes the perspective of and Ifrit and shows the troubles Dainyl and all other Alectors faced. I for one can't wait until I read the fifth and sixth book to see if the things I am guessing right now are what really happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"alector's choice","review":"This book is the fourth book in the Corean Chronicles, but it actually takes the reader back a few thousand years to when the Ifrits first come to Corus.

A great read, as is expected now from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 4th book in the Corus series!","review":"An enjoyable continuation of the series.Although the story for this novel takes place on Corus, the action occurs many years before the Alucius based trilogy; and of course, there is an entirely new set of characters.This is a tale told with similar characteristics as the previous three novels in this series. The story is not profoundly deep, but good story telling techniques, plenty of action and a couple of heros not too far removed from the Alucius mold make it an interesting fantasy/adventure read.Anyone who liked the previous three books will, I'm sure, enjoy this one as well; also, there are enough loose ends in the last couple of chapters to make one look forward to the final installment of this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"FInally a cookbook for the average jane","review":"fun to read, great to look at and even I can follow these recipes!

But after the first week, it won't be very useful.I use Vim everyday as a computer programmer, and whenever I need to figure out how to do something, I now just turn to google. The book covers many features of Vim, but in not much detail. The Appendix is sparse and often wrong. And topics are usually scattered in 3 different places in the book.For example, I don't use macros a lot, but I know they are a simple and powerful feature that many Vim users use all the time. Looking up how to use them took me through 2 sections and 15 minues. And the command involes only 2 keys!The first two chapters tell you how to get started in VIM with the basic commands - and its easy enough to follow along with. But the other 28 chapters don't help you get much done at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbled, inconsistent, windows-tilted book for beginners","review":"I had extremely high hopes for this book. I spend at least 12 hours a day using vim. My hope was that I'd learn a couple new things that would help me use vim more efficiently, or macros, or whatever.Unfortunately, this book is really not written for an experienced vim user. It is written for somebody who is scared of vi in general and needs a book to start with. The author goes over such mundane details as \\"how to get out of insert mode\\" to a horrifying degree.I didn't really learn anything reading this book. Vim comes with exceptional documentation, and this book seems to be nothing more than a digestion of that documentation.I really would recommend against this book for all but the very new-to-unix user.Oh, and the occasional commentary throughout the book about how unix vim isnt \\"smart enough\\" to do something the windows vim does just made me sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Rock-A- Billy Music","review":"If you would like to once again hear some of the old sounds that you haven't heard in some time that brings back the good sounds that came out of mainly the Deep South but actually spread over most all the Country, then you will like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for a kid or be a kid","review":"Not technically a kid's album, but written from Harry's point of view growing up in the 40's.

Harvey asks hard, delicate questions that poke at the very framework of modern society and makes you question assumptions about people and cities that you didn't even realize you had. Utopia has never been so interesting.The appendix, in which Harvey delineates a society wherein he uses the ideas he describes in the book, is extremely interesting and contradictory. Worth the price of the book alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic's classic","review":"For a fashion book to still seem timely and vital fifteen years after it was written says something----it's special.

Even when the toaster worked, toasting was uneven and it took a long time to warm up. The price is good, but you get what you pay for.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"When I saw the \\"surround feature\\" of this toaster, I thought \\"great, no more unevenly toasted slices of bread\\". The surround feature on this toaster closes the top of the toaster to keep the heat inside and in theory, gives evenly toasted breads. Unfortunately, science tells us that HEAT RISES and because this toaster does not let the heat escape, we have uneven toasted bread; burned at the top, and brown at the bottom. This is a horrible toaster, but it looks nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one..","review":"This appeared to be a bargain that was too good to pass up - the Cuisinart name at a rock-bottom price.

My grimace led to a bowl of Grape Nuts being dumped over my head... ah well. Sorry all you fans, but to my mind, Wilkinson is vastly overated. His exaggerated, affected style is strained, irritating and dripping with fake sincerity. His modulations and phrasings are all formulaeic and dished out in overcooked mounds of soggy sentimentality.

It's a great way to connect with the higher self and be aware of areas of improvement. The downside is that the cards are printed on silver-grey background - orange on silver, blue on silver, pink on silver - not much contrast, and those of us who are color-challenged have a hard time reading them without a very bright light. I have had to humble myself and ask other people to read the cards for me in situations where the lighting wasn't bright enough to distinguish the words from the background. Even a few non-color-challenged folks have had the same problem. In concept, I give it a score of 5. In usability, a 2-3.

They are not Spiritual in nature, simply enjoyable.While I don't listen to a LOT of classical music, these are some that most people will enjoy.It is rather surprising, but nowhere in the material does it give any information on the source, orchestra, band, or director who created these wonderful pieces.

Every member of the group is an amazing musician and composer as well. The pianist, at least live, was very reminiscent of Monk and the rythm section was fantastic.

This one really doesn't. There's the trademark cute and intelligent animals, the wisewoman (wysen-wyf, a title that kept giving me a mental image of one of those dried apple dolls), the Sulcar--uh, Sea-Rovers, and some palace intigue. But honestly there was too much happening and the authors did not draw it all together. The book lacked a sense of \\"place\\" which never happened with Witch World. It was very hard to get a sense of when the actions were occurring in relation to one another. And none of characters seem to come into focus.I really had to push myself to finish this book, which has never happened with a book that Ms. Norton has done alone, and I really don't care what happens in the rest of the proposed series.Guess I'll just have to wait for the second Edgehill/Norton book due out this month. I thought Shadow of Albion was a real feast and I'm eagerly awaiting the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutable Time & Geography","review":"This was the first Andre Norton book I had read in many years and I was very disappointed in it. I had much higher expectations.What really annoyed me about it was the highly mutable geography and timeline. The map was nothing like the geography described in text. The Bog was north, west, or south of the kingdom depending on what paragraph was being read. A teenage girl could cautiously walk through the dangerous bog in a few hours but it took a week for sea rovers to sail around the edge. The antagonist could magically scry upon the protagonist, spend several days doing other things then scry again and only a few hours would have passed in the life of the protagonist.There was no thought, logic, or consistency to matters of time, travel time, and geography; and I found that very aggravating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of her best","review":"As an avid Norton fan for more than thirty years, I was extremely disappointed in this story. It led one to believe a major confrontation between good and evil was about to take place any moment yet nothing ever happens. The ending was a complete let down. If I had picked up this book thirty years ago, I would have miss out on some of the greatest works of SF ever written. This simply is not up to Norton's standards and cannot compare to the Witch World series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Setting the stage","review":"The book had a LOT of potential but didn't really fulfill any of it. The reader is left completely unsatisfied that anything productive has been done minus that the stage has been set for (hopefully) a sequel in which there will be some actual ACTION. I found it very frustrating that the authors had three different threads of events going on and didn't weave them together into any kind of conclusion. Instead, the book is basically bringing those three threads together. End of story. Nothing resolved.

Only then will this book be worthwhile for background."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norton or Miller?

He made a good point with his bank poster 'pranking'. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Substantial","review":"This is really a substantial wall mount, and probably more so than needed for LCD wall panel TVs. The back plate is larger than some and limits placement of outlets behind it. Since it is truly universal, including accommodating a swing mount onto the wall plate it may be heavier and larger than needed for a simple fixed or tilt screen. The holes are a bit limited in placement as well.Having said that, I like it, in that it is definitely solid and I know that it will stay on the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy card sender","review":"I love being able to send out personalized cards with the persons name in the same type as the card's message.

Almost like printing on plain paper.The envelopes are thin, pretty much bottom of the barrel.Software (a 'trial version') only works on PC, MAC users need not apply.You get a fancy package with cheap product inside - Hallmark has a lot of nerve calling this 'Premium Blank' and 'High Quality', unless they are describing the box it comes in.If you are trying to make first rate greeting cards, this is not your solution.I spent my entire career in the graphic arts, so I know paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper jams","review":"I could only get this paper to feed correctly through my HP 7310 inkjet printer about 50% of the time, thereby causing me to go through an awful lot of paper... even after cleaning my printer. I much prefer the Hallmark Traditional Card size, which doesn't appear to be available anymore, and didn't give me nearly as much trouble as this paper. Plus, after printing, the card just didn't look as nice. It didn't stand as straight up as straight as the previous Hallmark card stock... I'm not sure that the other was thicker or anything, it just seemed less flimsy. For the cards that did print, the ink saturation looked good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decreased quality","review":"This is the second pack of IDENTICAL Hallmark cards. They are IDENTICAL boxes - 85lb (per box label), but clearly the second pack is a lighter weight card, it feels too flimsy. I bought the first box about 1.5 yrs ago.

The unsuspecting reader thinks that Wells uses clear, factual information, but I happen to know that most of his \\"facts\\" simply aren't true. Many interviews were given by people who hardly knew Ellsberg. This book is completely negative and I'm not satisfied with any of Wells's petty conclusions. Do not buy this UNAUTHORIZED biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a complete hatchet job","review":"This book is a poorly written hatchet job. It consists mostly of hundreds of pages of repetitive re-making of the point that Ellsberg is a disorganized, attention-seeking, narcissistic guy. For example: a downstairs neighbor's complaints that Ellsberg and his wife made too much noise walking around and used the wrong mailbox are dealt with at length. The biographer seems completely consumed by a pathological hatred of his subject. He needs to see a psychiatrist."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive undertaking","review":"Wild Man seems to me to be a very well researched book, and fair to Daniel Ellsberg.

When we tried to call the company, the number on the website was disconnected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mind-Blowing","review":"The Gift is an intense and revealing look at the L.A. drug subculture and the profound way it shapes the city's music scene. Jane's Addiction are a band for the ages and this movie proves it. But it also shows that the life of the musician and indeed the drug addict, is by no means an easy ride. It is also a moving love story, made all the more convincing by the fact that Casey Niccoli was Perry Farrell's real life love interest at the time this film was made. Above all else however, is the truly mindblowing 'duet' of \\"Don't call me Nigger, Whitey\\" between Jane's and Body Count. I have never seen such energy in a live performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"One more masterpiece from the Hypster himself...","review":"In true Perry fashion, he has created a touching, nauseating, emotional, and violently honest depiction of what it is to exist in the Zombie State of Super-Stardom Heroin addiction. Watch and learn, all you novices, what it means to be in the grip. No one is untouchable, major record-label-deal or no, and he'll ram the truth of it down your throat in true hype form. If you love Perry and all that he produces musically, venture into another world with him, his first and only full-length film-making event. Backed by 'Ritual' as the soundtrack, this movie will make your blood run like ice then like mercury, then like motor oil, and you'll drink in every second of the Hypster's magnificent fearless portrayal of himself and the woman he loves, and the drug he loves, and the city he loves. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning, unique response to death","review":"You must see this one. It is a beautiful love mixed with drugs story. It is wild and gentle at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Addicted to Jane","review":"Being a huge Janes Addiction fan it seemed only natural that I would like theis video. The song \\"Three Days\\" is an appropriately used song at a crucial, yet disturbing, point in the movie. This movie is not for the faint of heart, or for those who are offended by explicit drug use. It plunges the viewer into the sordid world of heroin junkies - a subject I am morbidly attracted to. Every Perry Farrell fan should own, or at the very least should see this movie at least once. Fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated.","review":"If you're a big Jane's fan, this is definitely worth seeing. At the same time, overall it's not that interesting. I bought this in 1993 when my love for Jane's was at its highest, and I was quite disappointed.On the plus side, it was nice to see footage of Perry and Casey hanging out. And there's some cool live Jane's performances. That Harry Perry guy on rollerskates. Ice-T jams with Perry over the end credits. And there's an awesome John Frusciante track.The bad stuff? Dull camerawork, some bad acting, lame humor (the pizza delivery guy, the doctor's receptionist, singing telegram). Parts of this movie are so amateurish it's hard to sit through.If you're not a Jane's fan, stay away from this film. If you are a fan, you might find it worth your time. And if you are obsessed with Perry your opinion may fail to be objective, resulting in embarrassing statements like \\"best film of the '90s\\" or \\"a masterpiece!\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"present yourself with Gift","review":"If you love the music of Perry Farrell and Jane's Addiction, then this is a must see.If you are not so familiar with the lively tunes of this early 1990s band I believe that you will still enjoy this film with its low budget quirkiness and realism.I highly recommend this movie to mature viewers only. There are explicit scenes of drug dealing and use. I admire Perry Farrell for not glorifying the use of the depicted Class A's. Although he does seem to demonstrate the \\"how to's\\" quite clearly while capturing the essence of the ritual of an addict.The music is fab, scenes of live performances are mixed in with the movie.You'll be touched by the emotion, intrigued by the spiritualism, excited by the band and amused by the subtle humour of life from Perry and Casey's perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sad Gift","review":"This movie doesn't stand the test of time - if it weren't for the concert footage, it would be virtually unwatchable.I was hugely into Jane's Addiction back in the olden days, and their music is still perhaps the most important creative achievement in alt rock. \\"Nevermind\\" never would have happened without \\"Nothing's Shocking.\\"But the story part of this movie is just a drug-addled, self-indulgent load of tripe. I'd much rather see all the performances together and then have the option of watching the mistakenly artsy story scenes.I'll still listen to their first three albums religiously, but I won't ever open this Gift again."},{"rating":"2","title":"T.

Salvatore is supposed to be some kind of knight in shining armor but he's comes across as too controlling. The last straw is when he goes behind Elisa's back and had her replaced at her job--and she just rolls over and accepts it. For me, that's when the story really died. Elisa was supposed to be this strong, independent woman, but she's not very intelligent and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exhausting and Exhilarating","review":"I welcome a new Vollmann book the way a 13 year old awaits a new Harry Potter novel. I finished The Royal Family last night, after taking my time over several months. For me, the highlight of the book is in the last 100 pages, the extended final act. The \\"Coffee Camp\\" sequence moves beyond the Tenderloin territory familiar to Vollmann readers since THE RAINBOW STORIES and encroaches on a realm both utterly familiar and totally new. The closest thing I can compare it to is the \\"wandering\\" portions of SUTTREE. If the rest of the novel had been this dense and addictive, I'd probably have read it in a week...but it was good to have something to savor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vollmann meets Hammett in the Tenderloin","review":"The Royal Family is William Vollmann's answer to Dashiell Hammett's The Maltese Falcon.

It's ideal if you plan to rent a car and drive the countryside. He tells you routes to take and suggests the most scenis ones. He also gives good, brief history of the areas and makes restaurant, hotel and site-seeing information, including telephone numbers which is incredibly helpful. My only complaint...and the reason I give four instead of five stars...is that in giving driving directions he does not tell you which way to head: north, south, east, west. So in mapping out my journey ahead of time, I am finding myself frustrated trying to figure out which direction he recommends and then looking for the villages on my map."},{"rating":"2","title":"off beat, refreshing","review":"this is an excellent cd. if you are like me, you are beginning to get tired of the same old same old. This is like nothing ive ever heard before. this is a weird mix between hardcore and emo. you can tell the singer is pouring his heart and soul into this record, and not a word wasted. The higlights are The Sadness Alone, The Truth so Familiar, Sunday Morning Awake, and Good Bye and Good Luck, but all are excellent. If you are looking for something a little bit different and offbeat, do yourself a favor and pick up this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tear Jerker, but Still Good","review":"Not as funny as the first volume (the anime two of the main characters were watching where two orchastra conductors are fighting was about the funniest scene) this was still great.

I, too, remember watching it on TV many years ago. The entire cast is wonderful, but Nino Manfredi's Geppetto is an especially memorable and touching performance by a great Italian actor.However, be aware that while there are both Italian and English-language soundtracks, if you want to hear the actors in their original Italian you'll have to do without subtitles--there are none on this DVD.

I believe the \\"Programming Python\\" book covers those topics.

Boy, was I mistaken.This would probably be a fine book for someone who is migrating from C++, but I found many of their explanations needlessly cryptic. They use, in all of the examples, phrases from Monty Python - understandable, but totally useless for someone who wishes to relate functions to real-life application.In short - if you've already mastered C, this book may help.

Someone with little coding experience will quickly get discouraged due to all the poorly explained terminology and constant references to C. Also, the pattern of the book is to give an introductory chapter on basic concepts then two or three chapters that get into extremely detailed explanations. At the end of one of those mind-numbing journeys through obscure details, the author will often will often say something like \\"But I would suggest you avoid doing this because...\\" Huh? Then why even bother to explain it? I can't believe Python is as dense and involved as this book makes it.

It has great coverage of active directory and carefully explained Windows 2000. The book also explains how Windows 2000 and Windows NT 4 relate to each other - very important since they will coexist for quite a long time. Then the book takes on the task of discussing Cisco networking and how that works on a NT and Windows 2000 network. I thought it went well beyond the basics (DEN, IOS issues, a bunch of Cisco hardware/software products) without going over my head. I think that the entire book really puts it all together well.

Thus one needs to ensure that there is a border left around the sticker created to keep the top layer adhered to the bottom layer. Very poorly designed. I have also not been able to locate any replacement materials, so the machine becomes useless in short order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't find replacement parts.","review":"My daughter bought this toy with money she saved, used up all the parts in less than an hour, and we were disappointed to find NO information on how to get replacement pieces to keep making stickers.

The VHS player stopped working completely in August. So, for six months being able to watch my VHS tapes again was nice, but the DVD side is a worthless piece of crap!furthermore, and other reviewers complained about this as well, the Remote... it's covered in buttons that I've never had a reason to use.

I recently used it to strip apart a rusted Datsun 1970 240Z...it broke free and removed body bolts that hadn't moved in 40 years with ease...saving my wrists. If you're looking for a flashy Nascar speed wrench for your wheel lugs this may not be it. It IS a powerful electric impact wrench though. I have read the model 293 was souped up to replace the model 292 which had mediocre ratings. Best tool money I've spent in a while...saved me from having to buy a compressor."},{"rating":"1","title":"345 ft. lbs? - Probably not","review":"I also purchased this electric impact wrench to avoid messing around with a compressor and pneumatic wrench. I have separate sets of summer and winter tires each mounted on their own rims. I always use a torque wrench when replacing wheels for the season, or detailed cleaning, etc. The only time they are possibly not properly torqued is at State inspection time - 1x/year in PA.The DeWalt tool has never been able to break the wheel nuts loose after a few days of the nuts being properly torqued. The nuts are steel and the wheels aluminum, and maybe some galvanic corrosion is taking place. But it's hard to believe that it takes more than the rated 345 ft-lbs to loosen the nuts. I use an 18\\" breaker bar to overcome the initial loosening, then use the DeWalt wrench. It does make the job faster in that respect; eliminating the spinning by hand. At least I get some use out of the tool, but it's disappointing that it won't work fully as intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first Dewalt product that I haven't been satisfied with - not very strong","review":"I am a weekend mechanic who values his time and tools. I am a firm believer in using the right tool for the correct job. I purchased this impact wrench that supposedly has 345 ft'/lbs of torque. I was using it to remove the wheels on my car that I torque to 90 ft/lbs with a torque wrench. This impact wrench was not powerful enough to remove any of the 20 lug nuts that i needed to remove. I tried each and every one of them, but ultimately had to use a breaker bar to loosen them all.The tried and tried and wanted to keep this tool, but ultimately returned it and am reverting back to using my air tools...or I may consider purchasing the Milwaukee equivalent. That seems to get better reviews at a slightly higher price. I don't recommend purchasing this product other than to unscrew lug nuts that are already loosened. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully-written, thought-provoking collection","review":"It is indeed a pity that Alvi's collection isn't read and studied more widely. The poems, which are clever yet accessible, deal mainly with the experience of immigration and the challenges that immigrants face in their adopted country. In constructing the psychological struggles of these cultural hybrids, Pakistan-born Alvi who now resides in the UK, draws on her own diasporic status. \\"Presents from my Aunts in Pakistan\\", which captures the simultaneous pride, embarrassment and unworthiness a young Asian girl in Britain feels in relation to the country of her birth, is easily the best poem in the volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it better than Country Falls....","review":"... which was a great LP, but I thought it was carried on the strength of only a few great tracks (Summertime Cowboy and City Nights).

Once you get used to the extra energy it's hard to go without it. Unfortunately after about a month you'll need to take more and more for the same results. Once you hit your peak you'll have to stop using it for atleast a month, before starting back up on it. That time period can be a real drag, but at least you'll be saving some money during that time as Nano Vapor is not cheap.

It keeps my kids entertained long enough at the restaurant while we wait for our food. We also keep it in the car because the boards are small enough to hold in their little hands and because they only contain 4 puzzle pieces per board there are less pieces to search for under the seats when they get dropped or thrown.A good buy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy children","review":"My son received this product as one of his Christmas gifts. I as a parent am impressed. These puzzles are great for the car trips since we travel a lot to see family. He is 4 yrs. old and perfect in size for him to be able in the car.

I highly recommend this product to every parent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good deal & useful toy.","review":"I am an early childhood educator in an early intervention program which serves children birth to three and provides support services to their families.Many of the children I work with have speech delays, difficulty focusing and completing tasks.These puzzles are great because they are just 4 pieces each and vehicles are a favorite of toddlers and two year old children. I recommend this particular toy to parents who are planning to travel with their children because the 4 small puzzles fit into a box that is secured by an elastic cord that holds the puzzles in the box. The puzzle pieces stay in place as well.I sterilize my toys after every use and I have notices that some of the puzzle pieces have started to peel away around the edges. This is unlikely to happen in normal family use.All in all I am a big fan of Melissa and Doug products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini puzzles","review":"This product was a favorite of my 2 year old. Not only did he learn new words (vehicles, boats, etc) but his hand eye coordination has also improved. The only issue (very minor one) I have with this toy is that there is an elastic band type thing at the opening of which I have no idea what its for. there wasn't enough stretchiness to lock all the puzzles in it's case. But overall, this was a nice, little puzzle."},{"rating":"2","title":"durable, convenient, but a little loose","review":"My 20 month old son liked this toy. He especially enjoyed to insert the 4 puzzle boards into the case. These puzzles are mini sized, so it is convenient to carry them out in a diaper bag. The pieces are kinda loose, so when you want to put the finished puzzles into the case, you have to level it well in order to let the pieces stay in place. This is not easy for a 20 month old one."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice for travel","review":"I bought this for my 21 month old, thinking it would keep him busy at a restaurant, or while traveling. It is a great idea, 4 different mini puzzles. I like that the elastic goes around all the puzzles, so they don't spill. I also like that, for now, my son needs assistance to open them, so he can't lose the pieces. We did lose a piece already, but it is still fun for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"You like GU then Y don't you own this?","review":"It's simple, take a trip back to those classic tracks where GU all began.

Nice big velvet box to put on the shelf with booklet of the same size with pictures and info. about the past GU series.CD 4 the GUmusic (unmixed) is fantastic and I loved using the tracks within my mixes.A 5 out of 5 for any avid GU fan such as me and so cheap for a great collectors item. JBhifi is selling it for over $100Aus cause it looks expensive, so buy it from here. Is a feature of the bookshelf and even a non-GU fans will want to take a look and have a feel of the velvet and say 'ooo nice box'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"When I bought this item right away I knew it was good. Every time GU comes out with the new CD release it comes out to be nearly perfect. So when I saw the description of it saying mixes of all GU's grated releases. Each CD offers you something different. From Decades to compilations you will always have something good to pick from. Because the box is 10\\" in size you virtually get a book not just a small cover that usually comes with CD's. The book is like a magazine each page has an article form different DJ's about their memories and events when their GU albums released.Get it and you will not be disappointed. But if you probably reading this by now, you don't need me to tell you that. I know you already made up your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad packaging, discs dislodged and scratched","review":"This review is only on the packaging. The packaging looks very nice, it is a 10\\" size red velvet box, a bit smaller than a LP. The big problem is that inside the CDs are placed next to each other (two in the top, two in the bottom). As a result, the chances that they get dislodged during transport are high: I got two copies of it and in both cases, all four CDs were dislodged and consequently scratched.The difference between this edition and the non-limited edition (ASIN: B000F5GKP4) is the fourth disc with unmixed songs. If this is the reason you plan on buying this edition, you can find most of the songs in their unmixed full length versions either on the GU 10 (unmixed) version (ASIN: B000GPI3BC) or on the artists' albums.I do not recommend this item, the rating of 1 star is based on the state in which it is unfortunately likely to be received, that is, damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dorky Dirk","review":"Was expecting leather, not platic meant to look like braided leather.

The photos are also fun and colorful and my kids (ages 3 & 5) love to look through this book and it does get them excited about cooking. My biggest complaint about this book is that the recipes are so unhealthy! I wouldn't want my kids eating or cooking with most of the ingredients. Having fun with your kids in the kitchen is a great way to teach them about nutrition with out them knowing it, and this book totally misses this point. For example, she has you cooking with hot dogs and jars baby food! If that doesn't bother you, you may like this book.

His songs are sincere, heartfelt, and simply beautiful. \\"All the Rage\\" is a stunning four-track EP about the different emotions of finding and losing love.

Also some classic rock and Heavy Metal. The album reviews are 95% right on if you like the wilder music.

It just proves he was never anything but another drugged-up beat scumbag. And not in an amusing way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"This book is excellent, a science fiction mystery with multiple plot twists and fascinating ideas, and a positive, uplifting, the world will be a better place in the future ending. I loved the characters, and thought the characterization of the memory loss and the abused woman were amazingly accurate, close enough to my own emotions to make me have to set the book down for a bit and catch my breath. The book surprised me several times, a very hard thing to do, and I love reading all his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Spider","review":"Inventive, well paced, and relevant.

This book didn't make any sense to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-Good","review":"I was really hoping that it would focus more on the \\"Once\\" rather than the \\"Future\\", but I was sadly disappointed. Although there were a few choice morsels detailing the suffering that smallpox has caused to people in the past, and the history of inocculation was also quite interesting, most of the book discussed the long (and rather boring) history of the global eradication of the disease, and the current dilemma with smallpox virus samples being stored in various locations around the world. I mean, it's not like those topics aren't interesting... but they cannot compare with the horrific, wince-inducing facts about the illness itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read on Infectious Disease, Morbidity and Mortality","review":"One of my standard arguments for the world getting better is to point out that for the first time in history we are free of deadly infectious diseases such as smallpox. In this biography of the disease, we learn the true cost of smallpox on humanity and how the disease has shaped human history. We also understand why we would never want to go back to a day when all people lived in fear of the pox."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"This is a great book, full of suspense. You're always wondering just how safe the protagonists really are - when they might be next on the killer's list. This one will keep you riveted until the very end, where a climactic finale finishes off an excellent story. And you'll never see the twist at the end coming - what a shocker!! An outstanding book, from cover to cover. If you liked this book, Purple Hayes, the next in the author's series, is arguably even better. Check them both out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW............................................","review":"Carly has long been known for two things; great music, and great album covers. This album has both. There is a line between \\"sexy\\" and \\"provocative\\"; where this one falls is truly in the eye of the beholder. There is a story, maybe apocryphal, that this picture provided the inspiration for Sharon Stone's famous scene in \\"Basic Instinct\\". Maybe...there are several stories about that.Forgetting the jacket [impossible, I know], this album presents Carly in her absolute prime. Speaking as an overage guy judging sexy album covers, I think \\"Hotcakes\\" tops them all. Musically, this is as good as it gets...\\"You Belong To Me\\" and the title cut are memorable; interesting idea in the closing cut...it may be best to avoid doing some things \\"For Old Time's Sake\\". This is a fabulous record...buy it, and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carly Simon's Best Album","review":"In my opinion, Carly Simon reached her peak with \\"Boys in the Trees.\\" The title song is a perfection, an observation of the ways boys are treated different from girls. The resulting denial of female sexuality is illustrated in the cover art, where Carly (thoughtlessly? intentionally?) pulls on her nylons in front of wide open windows.Highlights of the album are the title song, \\"You Belong to Me,\\" \\"Devoted to You\\" (a remake of the Everly Brothers' hit done as a duet with former hubby James Taylor), \\"\\"Haunting,\\" \\"and \\"In a Small Moment\\" I enjoy the humour of \\"De Bat (Fly in Me Face).\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"De Bat Is De Good","review":"I have been on a quest to get all of Carly's old albums on CD, and the collection keeps going up with this latest addition.The first CD I bought of hers when I decided I loved her was 1975's Playing Possum and it has still been my favorite, followed closely by 1979's Spy and 1974's Hotcakes, but running around in there would be this 1978 effort which featured her hit \\"You Belong To Me\\" - a Michael McDonald co-write which brought her back to the top 10.The rest of the album is just as clever and meaningful as anything she had done before, probably her last collaboration with James Taylor as they would divorce a few years later, Boys In The Trees contains their duet \\"Devoted To You\\" (an old 60's Everly Brothers song), and a hilarious Jamaiccan reggae thing called \\"De Bat (Fly In Me Face)\\", and some other little gems. If you're looking for classic Carly, this is one to get your hands on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last \\"Hit\\" for Elektra Records","review":"Carly collaborated with legendary producer Arif Mardin for the first time on this release. Commercially, they hit a home run. But, this album is not as good as people think. Sure, she had the big hit \\"You Belong to Me\\" and the marginal hit \\"Devoted to You\\" on here, but there were also a couple of misfires included here too. What was \\"De Bat (Fly In Me Face)\\" & \\"One Man Woman\\" doing on here? They had an opportunity to create a masterpiece, but instead created a mish-mash of an album. \\"Back Down to Earth\\", the title track, \\"Haunting\\", \\"You're the One\\", \\"In A Small Moment\\" are great songs, they fit nicely with the two singles, but there had to of been some other things they could of included here. It still gets 4 stars, cause of those songs, plus the best song on the album \\"For Old Times Sake\\", but they had a chance for something great and they faltered. I still give it 4 stars because I love everything Carly does, but this album could of been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"CARLY","review":"If you listen really close , back then AWB were in the mix with Onnie McIntyre and Hamish Stuart with \\"Tranquilo\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I was there and she is right","review":"I came to work Washington Square Park a year after this book was published and it was one of the greatest thrills of my life.

The author really got to know the performers and was there long enough to learn what is really happening in this amazing space. I came to know many of the performers in this book and it was a thrill to learn more about their past and inspiration that brought them to this place.

I'm not downing MTV Unplugged though, I can remember some rocking shows from when I was younger; seeing Nirvana and Alice in Chains tear it up live acoustically. Today however, MTV is less than a shadow of what it used to be back in the early nineties, and thanks to everyone's favorite AIC impersonators Staind, it's all of the sudden cool to play an acoustic guitar again. When you watch this live performance, you can feel the eerie feeling you've seen this before, and this is proven as we hear Aaron Lewis try to croon like Layne Staley. These songs on here are supposedly about loss, remorse, and regret, but none of it seems to ring true, and the live performance itself doesn't seem all that inspired.

It was such a lovely cozy series, I don't know what got up the author's nose, but much as I like his characters, I can no longer believe them. Seriously, Alan Cook, come out and say what you have to say,on your own terms, and then write another Lillian Morgan cozy. Leave your awful politics out of it.

Not even stereo.I've done exhaustive research on the net but came up with nothing. Problem still exist.Additional info:Using Windows Vista UltimateI noticed that in Creative Entertainment center there is an icon for digital I/O, however its missing for my version.

To me, the worst part was that the narrator's attidude changed in less than a day. It was completely unrealistic. I have heard that this is a true story; if so, something very critical was lost during the writing.

Gino & his brothers made the best use of 70's synthesizers & it sounds as good today as it did when first made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Gino!!!","review":"Prior to ordering this CD I had only been familiar with Gino Vanelli's most well known hit records which I had heard in the 70's and 80's as a child. But even as a child, I always admired the incredible range and sheer beauty of his voice. 30 years later, his voice and the production of his music still amazes. Even his lesser known singles on this CD are fantastic!! They simply don't produce records, write or sing songs of this magnitude anymore. This collection is truly a testament to Gino's incredible God given talent to bring joy to others with song. If you are truly a music lover and enjoy poetic,insightful lyrics, phenomonal vocals, masterful arrangements and top quality sound and production I strongly recommend purchasing this CD. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This compulation of past music...","review":".....is a must have for anyone who loves beautiful, well executed music and a voice range that you will astound every note and octave change compiled in this CD and then comes \\"Canto\\". This CD will bring you even closer to the vocal perfection we all have come to know and appreciate. It is some where between Andre' Bocelli and Josh Groban yet it is very much a mix that is purely Gino.Yet, he does not follow as he is in a catagory of his own in any endeaver he pursues....Outstanding........Jp..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dutch Do It Again","review":"By far this has to be the best compilation of Gino Vanelli's work to date. Two CD's filled with the hits and some nice tracks that should have been hits and a bonus third CD with a cool danceable version of \\"Black Cars\\" included . Why is it that the Japanese and the Dutch can release the best compilations while the US puts out crap usually filler songs and rarely the original version of the song. I for one do not like remakes of a song once I hear it unless it is a live performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"very versatile Musician","review":"Gino Vannelli always had alot of versatility in his music over the years.

The quality of the product is very cheap and not what I expected. The size is quite large as well, than a normal med/lg article of clothing. I must say I am quite disappointed for the amount that I purchased the item. I would return the item, but do you know how much it cost to send something to China!? That would be crazy? It would cost just as much to mail as it was to purchase. At the end, I would probably get back $10 of the $40 I spent. So, I am stuck with a piece of clothing I will probably never wear! Unfortunate indeed. I will not purchase from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recorded with a Cactus Needle","review":"I disagree with the previous reviewer. The sound quality isterrible.

It's interesting, engaging, and smart. It peaked my daughters interest and has a lot of replay value (she uses the quizzes on her friends as well). The author has made the quizzes and activities relevent to a school-age girls without being Too Darn Girly. Both my older and younger son found it interesting and fun.

Lots of times solo projects simply flop because the individual's talent relies on the band. This though, is something worth getting. While Lars formed this side project, Tim Armstrong has helped co-write some of the songs and produced the record on Hellcat Records. What makes this album different than a Rancid record is Lar's singing ability which goes far beyond what i expected. This cd gave Lars a platform to share with us what usually only served as backup to Tim in Rancid. The song writing is also tight and the record themes around the town where Lar's grew up in. There's plenty of classic hooks and anthem style songs while also showing a more emotional side of the songwriter. Expect the buzz on this CD to pick up with time, its a gem and can stand on its own even without the Rancid credentails."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the last few rancid cd","review":"more aggressive punk rock and better than all rancid since lets go & wolves.the rest of rancid should look to this cd for a more punk influences"},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not perfect","review":"i dig rancid, have all their cds, seen a couple of their shows so when lars came out with this i bought it right away. i like all the songs except wine and roses, leavin here, and vietnam (vietnam would be ok if it weren't for the last part when they're yelling vietnam over and over)it's worth getting just to hear six foot five and to have and to have not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Selfish Lars appeals only to Lars","review":"I don't know much about Lars Frederiksen, but he obviously doesn't think much of his band. He knows them a lot better than I do so he may be right, but I'm prepared to give them a chance. This is more of a compilation of other artists than a Lars Frediriksen album. Lars takes his vocal stylings from one popular punk rock band, while his drummer copies another, his guitarists steal from another, etc. I don't know which bands are borrowed from because they all sound the same to me. The man on the cover of this album has a mohawk hair cut which shows he is a big fan of the A-Team and Mr. T. I bought this album expecting to hear something Mr. T would be proud of and maybe some songs about Mr. T, but instead Lars chooses to whine selfishly about his own life. He breaks from this however to sing \\"Army of Zombies\\", a song about the SNES game \\"Zombies Ate My Neighbours\\". Overall this a decent Rancid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"cant get any better","review":"after hearing intro got little scared then dead american came on and knew it would rule. i love campbell california and the remake of billy bragg's to have to have not. done really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of special interest and value for the novice student","review":"For the non-specialist general reader, the history of the land of Robert Burns, Scotch whisky, and Queen Mary has never been so well done as with the Oyster Press edition of The Illustrated History Of Scotland by Chris Tabraham (Principal Inspector of Ancient Monuments for Historic Scotland).

Some of its more outstanding qualities are witty dialogue, and of course the inevitable romantic interest, which was better done in this one than in some others I've seen.

This album highlights many outstanding songs these men have written, and reveals the engaging personalities of these musicians. The wonderful tunes performed in a small venue with some great between songs patter helps gives this album a refreshing down-to-earth homey vibe. This was also one of the last times the three shared a stage; Van Zandt passed away less than two years later. This is an album that any fan of these artists, collectively or solo, should really enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the best","review":"Steve Earle has managed to build a pretty good audience over the years; Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt should be household names in certain parts of the country but remain sadly unknown to the bulk of us. This magical album presents each artist at their stripped-down best: taking turns doing their own songs with just voice and guitar, in the Bluebird Cafe's fine Songwriters in the Round tradition. The songs are exceptional, the performances heartfelt, the wit in good doses. Townes seemed to be having an especially good night, considering the depth of his alcoholism and depression; his material is probably the most rewarding. If you enjoy the sound of just a man's voice and his guitar, this is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three superstars performing together -- how can you go wrong?","review":"Great songwriting, great performances!

His last trip to the desert in The Secrets of Harry Bright was, as was much of his early work, a story cops could relate to and enjoy reading. Much of his newer work (Fugitive Nights, The Golden Orange, Finnegan's Week, etc)involve characters who are burn-outs or alcoholics. Stories like these are somewhat cliched, and do not typify most police officers. While they do exist, these characters detract from the story instead of adding to it. Perhaps being out of police work for so many years has left Mr. Wambaugh without a sense of what it's like, or how interesting the working cops still are. It's too bad because his early work was very real AND entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice try, but, again, no cigar.","review":"Wambaugh manages to keep you entertained in this novel.

I am now using a panasonic which works as long as you remove the gadget that is supposed to hold the hairs up. My conclusion is that the extra gadgets that these companies keep adding to supposadly make them less painful don't work. I wish I could get the original Epilady that I had for 10 years that worked great--the newer one that Epilady makes did not work at all and then I had 2 Emjois in a row which worked ok but they both died after less than 2 years which is why I was looking for a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epilator jammed after working for 15 minutes","review":"It was being used for the first time.

The epilator removes the hair and the ice pack does help. It does have some downfalls, but from I've noticed, so do all epilators, so I didn't count them against it with my rating. It does cause some ingrown hair- exfoliation helps. It also was a bit painful, particularly around my ankles, but nothing I couldn't handle, and it did get better with consecutive use. Lastly, hair DOES grow in shifts, so you won't be able to epilate once and forget about it for 3 weeks. You will have to epilate again, but once you've gotten all the shifts, it will last for a while. This is definitely a nice epilator. The only thing you can really hold against it in particular is that it has no cordless mode. Ah, pick your battles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I read reviews on a few different epilators before deciding on this one. The reviews for the Braun were pretty good, but they all had one thing in common--PAIN. Of course any product that rips your hair out is going to hurt, but I didn't see that same theme in all of the Satinelle reviews. I'm a regular waxer, so maybe I'm a little more used to the procedure, but I was really surprised at how little discomfort I had with this, and I used it on my bikini line, which is one of the more sensitive areas.

Everyone said, \\"Wow these things are great!!\\" I tried a couple of other 10 X 50 brands but these had the best overall properties. Very clear picture with precise focus adjustments that you would expect from much more expensive binoculars. They also filter out unwanted glare from the sun and cut through the haze. They appear to be very well built and look a little sharper than your average binoculars as well. They are a bit heavy but I'm not going back-packing with them so, the extra weight is not a problem. The strap that comes with them is a joke but the Binoculars themselves get 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality. Avoid!","review":"I was extremely frustrated by these binoculars during several viewing sessions. I had to constantly adjust the diopter in order to get a clear view in both sides. After examining them closely I realized that the yoke (the part that joins the oculars to the focus rod) is made extremely cheaply and is attached very loosely to the focus rod. Every time you adjust the focus knob the oculars are moved out of alignment. This means you can only hope to have one side in focus, giving you a monocular instead of a binocular. I have included two pictures to show what I mean. This is simply poor build quality that causes this problem. The optics seem to be good, it's sad that they ruined this binoc with a poor focusing system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teachable Touchables","review":"A little smaller than I expected but will work nonetheless.

This is one of the most amazing subjects in -- and out of -- this world, but this book is bland and sometimes wrong. What a waste. It's another tale of the X-15 and moon program, thinly told through Armstrong's resume. Yes there is some neat and new stuff here, but not much. It is all overshadowed by the errors and omisions. Yes, that is Buzz on the cover. The quote as Armstrong walked on the moon is wrong. Neil was not an 'ace' in Korea. In describing an Earth orbit docking, Wagener talks of 'twinkling' navigation lights -- but I thought the twinkling we see is an atmospheric effect. What did it really look like in orbit? I don't trust this book to tell me.There are many great books on Armstrong's times and events, I'd buy many of them before this one.

Armstrong"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Inaccuracy after Another","review":"The book cover tells us that Wagener was a journalist for 30 years. This book makes me wonder what kind of journalist he was. The book is full of inaccuracies. Some examples: he calls cosmonaut Alexi Leonov Alexi Leonor; he states that Christa McAuliffe was selected as the Teacher in Space because she won a \\"Why I Want to Go Into Space\\" essay. (cheapening her hard work and ultimate sacrifice); he writes the shuttle's solid rocket boosters fall into the ocean and are never used again even though they are recovered, refurbished, and reused. There is no documentation for statements he makes that contradict other records. This is poorly written and researched book. I have told my wife, who is the director of our local library, not to waste money buying the book. I won't donate my copy to the library. Ignore the book and read the books written by those who were a part of the effort of going to the moon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Subject . . . Poor Book","review":"I must admit I was skeptical about this book upon seeing Buzz Aldrin on the cover instead of the books subject Neil Armstrong. I tried to give the author the benefit but upon reading the book it was just filled with too many factual errors to be considered an accurate account of Armstrong. Admittedly I am an aircraft and space enthusiast and someone who didn't know about the subject would not catch the most of the errors in this book, however, the erroneous information discounts the validity of the book in my opinion. It's a shame because what an intriguing character Neil Armstrong is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money or the Time","review":"Even if you ignore the dozens of technical errors, the fact that the author never interviewed the subject speaks volumes about the insights that aren't there.

The author attempts to use every word in his thesaurus, and the proofing is terrible. But what is most upsetting is the many factual errors in this book. What really makes me wonder is I know how many I caught, how many am I not aware of? I have been waiting for THE book to be written on Armstrong. I am still waiting.

If you are truly interested in the possibility of chiropractic as a means to becoming heathier read the book by R. Martin or Chiropractic First."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ TWO OTHER BOOKS","review":"This is a poorly written book about one person's opinion on a subject in which he has little to no knowledge. Always remember what works for one, might not work for another. I have been on both sides of the coin both in orthopedic surgery and as a chiropractic student. Want to know why I switched?!? The truth is one disgruntled chiropractic patient will never equal the amount of medical mishaps and deaths. I suggest anyone who reads this book to read Chiropractic First by Terry Rondberg D.C. and also Confessions of a Medical Heretic by Robert S. Mendehlson M.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"This author does not have a clue!!","review":"Gee, thousands of people die each year because of medical doctors(drug interactions, failed surgery and so on)chiropractors rarely kill anybody(probably none), some injuries do occurr though. Your chances with a MD are much slimmer than with a chiropractor."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought a doctor lived by the expression \\"First do no harm","review":"A very silly book, obvious propaganda, Manger certainly has an agenda. I'm very aware that medicine has a dismal record when it comes to back problems (I know..I'm an Internist). I've referred many to chiropractors and have received marvelous feedback. Pain which had been present for years had resolved in a relatively short time. This is after the patient (or insurance) spent countless thousands on PT, MRI's, Cat Scans etc. If this book keeps potential patients away from a very probable method to relieve symptoms, then Manger is \\"Doing Harm\\" Isn't the patients welfare the primary concern? Not with Manger, and his buddies..especially Barrett and Hamola. Lastly..a suggestion to these \\"quackwatch\\" people: Learn to write intellegently, the public are not fools!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chiropractic: The Victim's Perspective","review":"Four months ago I was in constant pain and sufferred non-stop hip spasms. My lower spine was bent 40 degrees. I was considering surgery. I found a great chiropractor who did adjustments, traction, e-stim, and laser over a three month period (3 visits a week). I now am nearly fixed, my lower spine is now only 10% off of perfectly straight. Pain and muscle spasma are completely gone. It was nothing short of miraculous. Maybe chiropractic doesn't work for everyone, but for me it is a tool that has given me my life back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous biased book","review":"Don't even bother reading the title, this book is ridiculous and biased.

Can't believe someone would even write a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book describes opinions of ignorance.","review":"This book is a joke. Obviously lacking truth and wisdom. The fact that chiropractors pay malpractice premiums far lower than MDs and DOs proves that this field is far safer than conventional medicine. It is hard to conceive a source less conservative or more non-biased than insurance adjusters. Chiroprators must take and pass four distinct national board tests before their license is granted. MDs oftentimes practice without board certification. The author of this book obviously should conduct more research on his chosen subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and silly author.

This is like looking into how many people die in car crashes after a \\"manipulation\\". Where's the causality. To me, this \\"oversight\\" or lack of scientific acuracy reflects poorly on the author, who's agenda is clear. I am a chiropractor, and I have now practiced for four years.

Barrett and his associates seem to know nothing about their topic and blindly write like raving lunatics (no matter how many so-called \\"references\\" they have).

This is a book for setting aside and leaving alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punishing the entire profession!","review":"To say all chiropractors are bad and that the entire profession is at fault simply because you have a bad experience with ONE doctor is ludicrous. Just like any other profession (medical or otherwise), there are good doctors and bad doctors, even MD's. I do not think Mr. Magner would say all of allopathic medicine and all MD's are terrible if he had a bad experience with one doctor, or did not respond to treatment. So why is Chiropractic different? There are literally dozens of different techniques chiropractors use to treat the spine, and some people respond better to one more than the other. Instead of bashing chiropractic, take the time to talk with someone who has benefited from care and see THEIR doctor. Maybe Mr. Magner is content to take pills, potions and lotions for the rest of his life. Take the time to read a positive book about chiropractic and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bonfire Material","review":"Anyone who has read this book has read these reviews, I hope. Anyone who was a beleiver of bashing Chiropractic before,should agree by now that you have no business listening to one man's disgust for a great natural healthcare that just didn't work for him. Perhaps he fails to tell us all of the fact that he didn't follow his Chiropractor's treatment plan and wouldn't take any responsibility for his own health. Its refreshhing to see all of you bash him back and set the story straight.

Not only that, it never discussed the success ofchiropractic. Medicine and medical doctors kill tens of thousands of people each year with dangerous treatments and drugs, yet they quickly dismiss the field of chiropractic. I have Stephen Barrett's work for twenty years, and he never portrays the good points of anything that may detract from the success of medical doctors.

And for all those who think this is an exaggeration check out New England Journal of Medicine, July 1998. It speaks for itself on better living through chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and lacking accurate data","review":"I am very disappointed in this book.

As a doctor of chiropractic I know how many people we can help keep away from the surgical knife. With proper chiropractic, x-rays are analysed to determing which bone has shifted. The shifted bone is put back in its place in the same direction that it shifted from and the problem is reduced, pressure is take of the nervous system, and biomechanics restored."},{"rating":"1","title":"A close minded uninformative book.....","review":"This book was not created for the intention of informing the consumer, but to create a fear and hatred for an alternative approch to a failed healthcare system. My major concern was that the author failed to mention that the majority of the injuries occured from manipulation of the spine were done by M.D.'s (including orthopedist's, P.T.'s, and D.O.'s). D.O.'s are doctors of osteopathy who were taken under the wing of the AMA when they began their fight against Chiropractic in the 80's. They had to pay 30 million dollars to the Chiropractic field (which was distributed to Chiropractic Colleges and research programs) because of improper conduct and actions such as this book. Please write to the publisher and tell them what you feel regarding this publication. Its our choice to see a licenced health care provider who will handle our health care needs as an individual human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"After reading this book, I have to wonder if it wasghost-written by its editor. It does not even attempt to present anhonorable picture, and ended up just bashing chiropractic--despite its proven effectiveness.

Not a great read, and not really worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"All health care has risk","review":"This book is a biased attempt to scare people away from alternative health care choices. Certainly, chiropractic has risks, but the problem is not with the chiropractors or chiropractic, it is a part of all health care. Many people have been hurt or killed by well intentioned health care of all types. Medicine, like chiropractic, is not a perfect science. Many people have died from drug reactions and surgical complications, but are not \\"victims\\" of medicine.

She's one of my favorites but I was so disappointed in hearing this Christmas CD after hearing her first Christmas CD \\"Merry Christmas to You\\".

Thanks Reba."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO!!!","review":"I have a huge amount of CHristmas music. I have this one. But Reba's first Christmas offering was loads better than this!! If you're going to record a Christmas album, have production on it that make it at least sound like Christmas, not like ordinary every day songs. That's the problem with this mediocre release.

The songs here aren't bad but the production is no different than any other time of the year. Christmas music MUST sound CHRISTMASY in order to put me in the holiday mood. This CD just didn't do it for me. There were a couple of songs I liked such as \\"Mary Did You Know\\" and \\"Up on the Housetop\\" but for the most part, all the songs are just ordinary ballads that would fit on any Reba CD. If you want a really good Christmas CD buy Reba's first CD \\"Merry Christmas to You\\". That one earns five stars from me and more!! Also recommended for Christmas is Patty Loveless' masterpiece \\"Mountain Christmas\\" or the above mentioned \\"Lorrie MOrgan Christmas Album\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS A CHRISTMAS ALBUM??????","review":"I only heard one song that I liked and that was \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" which is along the traditional feel that Reba's first Christmas album had.

I won't be playing this come Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERDONE NON-CHRISTMAS SOUNDING CD","review":"As are most of Reba's later CDs, this one is also overdone. The fact that it is a CHristmas offering is purely peripheral. The main thing is that its more overdone stuff of the pop element of which McEntire has been singing for all these years now. Nothing new is offered here and certainly it won't become a Christmas classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BELLS AREN'T RINGING ON THIS CD!","review":"This is NOT a Christmas CD at all, as some other reviewers have noted. Its another of Reba's Pop Mishmash. I hate the what she did to a beautiful song like \\"Mary Did You Know\\". Oh, she really butchered a classic Christmas song.

This one does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE TO AGREE","review":"It pains me when I have to rate a Reba product low. I've done so on a couple of her CDs that I just don't think made the mark. But this, as a Christmas CD, is very inferior compared to her first Christmas CD which I really love. Its too bad that she couldn't have picked better standards and better songs for this one and she could have incorporated some Christmas sounding stuff on here as well to set it apart from the stuff she usually does. There is nothing distinctive about this CD at all. I hoe she releases another Christmas CD in the future and that she does it in a \\"classic\\" way that sounds Christmasy...like Clay Aiken's Christmas CD or Patty Loveless' Mountain Christmas CD...those are incredible. This one is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"SANTA WON'T BE COMING TO TOWN WITH THIS CD!!","review":"I certainly agree with the consensus on this one.

Best to bypass this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ORDINARY SECULAR STUFF...NOT CHRISTMAS","review":"The tunes may have a holiday theme but most of them are pop ballads the kind Reba does all the time. Its just ordinary. Sure we have \\"Up on the HOuse Top\\", \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" and \\"Did You Know\\". The only good one on there was \\"Mommy\\" but she brings nothing new to \\"Mary Did You Knew\\" (Kathy Mattea's version and especially Clay Aiken's version is much, much better). The rest of the tunes are filler pop tunes that could have been included on any secular CD of hers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love REBA!!!","review":"I just bought this CD this past weekend, and listened to it all the time. I'm already in the Christmas mood and it's only October!!! I thought a couple of the songs might have been a little childish for Reba when I was reading the titles on the insert,...until I heard them. Like \\"Up on the housetop,\\" I thought that was going to be a dumb song to have on a country album,...but Reba spiced it up and put some groove in that song, and it's even easy to dance to!!! Once again Reba did it! Great all around CD, good for after holidays too. Just made me that much more anxious to hear her next album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super CD.

It is more of Reba's popish, foppish, malarky that she's been recording for more than 16 years now. Sure, the titles signify Christmas but that's about as Christmasy as this gets. The production values are terrible because the sound is just pop....not Christmasy at all....I prefer Reba's first Christmas CD \\"Merry Christmas to You\\" instead of this mess.

I'm sorry Reba."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Nothing special about the song performances. Doesn't elicit the Christmas feeling for me - feels more like Reba pop. No heart or soul in Reba's interpretations here. Too bad. I was especially interested in hearing Reba sing \\"Mary, Did You Know?\\", but I was disappointed. Lackluster. Love the cover though - Reba looks great, as always.Wow! I just noticed something! It's obvious that on September 29, 2005, Reba fans performed a good magic trick and changed the skew of the rating for this cd by stacking the deck with 5-star reviews. Shame! Plus the earliest reviews, particular those from the vague and numerous \\"A Customer\\" and those from the one-shot reviewers - who's ONLY review here on amazon.com (since 1999, no less) were for THIS cd - seem dubious as well. That explains the oddity of why reviewers here either really loved or really didn't like this cd, with scarce middle ground!

Reba is GREAT on this release (as always) and it's no wonder it's been certified GOLD! It's an amazing collection of traditional and contemporary Christmas music! She even includes her son and his elementary class on the song \\"The Angels Sang\\"! It's a great release!MERRY CHRISTMAS REBA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE CHRISTMAS FLUFF","review":"When I heard \\"Up on the Houstop\\" turned into a rock and roll fiasco I had to laugh. The only decent thing on here is \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" which is reminiscent of Reba's first Christmas album. Maybe they held it over for this one. But one good song on a CD is not worth it...especially a Christmas CD. If you're going to make a Christmas CD at least have some sleigh bells on the tracks to make it sound like Christmas!! Enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I AGREE, IT AINT CHRISTMAS AT ALL!!","review":"Forget this one folk! If ya like Christmas music, get Reba's first one \\"Merry Christmas to You\\".

Reba's first Christmas CD \\"Merry Christmas to You\\" was a good CHristmas CD. This travesty called \\"Secret of GIving\\" should have remained a secret and to call it a Christmas CD is ridiculous.

During the surgical scenes, it really looks like Dr. Holt (Patrick Wilson) is operating. The acting is first rate. If you missed this show when it was on or if you want to remember how good it was, the videos are for you. You will enjoy the show, though, like me, you'll wish there were more than 16 episodes to find out what happens to these characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major flaws","review":"Got this toaster oven several years ago and am still using it. I really liked the slide out liner feature. Haven't slide it out to wash it enough to really justify it, however. More of a problem is the uneven cooking time -- toast, for example, first round may be just right, next round may take two rounds to get it right, third round, probably burnt. Also, the plastic door handle slid off -- the glue melted from the heat. It is still usable but not great. Now that my kids are starting to do their own toast, I don't trust it enough anymore.

The graphics are sub-standard (you must have a 50+inch TV in order to read the titles), the gameplay is simple and not very interactive (just press X to roll, press X to buy, and you will be pressing X for a long time with no real interaction with the game. The animations are dull (when the hat moves you have to wait a longgg time before it arrives to its final square...obviously, you could turn the animations off, but that would just make the game even sleepier...)If you were waiting for a Monopoly game such as the ones made for PCs, this is not the case. Maybe you should wait for another PS2 version of this great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monopoly Party","review":"This is a fun game if you like to sit back and just push a button instead of having to actually roll the dice and move your token like on the real board game. You can play by your self with the computer or play with up to 4 players. There are 4 themes for the game board and tokens you can pick like the classic and sci- fi and prehistoric. It can go on for hours of fun or can get boring if no trading or building goes on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Board Game!","review":"Came earlier then I was expecting which is always exciting and it was in new condition as I had ordered.I was looking for two player PS2 games so I could have more family fun. I found this game and being partial to Monopoly games I read its description and since our family has a wide range of game interests and this looked like it would be faster and more fun than the long lasting board game I purchased it.I have to say it is way more fun than the board game! Everyone can roll together in party mode and take their turns and it works really well. Also you have five different board selections to play on. My favorite Ancient Monuments but you can also choose Fantasy, Sci-fi, Prehistoric, or the original Monopoly board. Play up to four players or choose to play against computer players. Its loads of fun and the odds can change every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior product","review":"I typically would not write a review on any product unless it is unusually great or very disappointedly poor in quality or function. The latter brings me to this fourm. I had enjoyed this unit in my office for about 16 months when, one day, the CD player simply refused to work any longer. The display panel would only state \\"CD CHANGE\\" for any of the 5 CD buttons pressed. No mention in the manual or on the Panasonic site has referenced this malfunction and since I primarily use the CD player this unit is now destined for the trash. The addvertisement for this unit should read \\"disposable\\" after 16 months. I'll buy an Onkyo next and hold my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointingly difficult to use","review":"This is the most difficult CD changer I've ever used!!!I'm the type of person who likes to pop in a CD and start listening. This simple act is nearly impossible with the PM-28's five cd loader. One cannot see what is in each tray unless you cycle through them all. Moreover, I have not yet been able to change a disc while listening to another. Another annoying feature is that too many functions are controlled from the remote. Cycling between CD's is way too time consuming. What's more, the random feature does not operate on MP3's so you HAVE to listen all 100 or so songs on your disc in order. Lastly, each time you unplug the machine, you HAVE to reset the clock, or a Panasonic ad scrolls constantly.All in all, one of the most disappointing purchases I have made in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Unfortunately I bought this EVERIO share station BEFORE I read the reviews.Normally, I am a little more careful than this.

His early works, such as 'Wild Wives', written in the 1950s is very much like the works of James Cain, David Goodis and Jim Thompson. Greed, desperation, and violence of the poor and forgotten (, alcoholics, druggies, psychotics) provide the backdrop of psychological dramas/crime stories.In 'Wild Wives' we have a San Francisco rarely employed private eye who is hired by a rich socialite. Of course he finds this woman irresistable who, unsurprisingly, puts him on a course of \\"misadventure\\". The woman we discover possesses many secrets (..no spoilers here), and Willeford treats us with a terrific ending. The book is very enjoyable and wonderfully lean (packs a punch in only 100 pages).Bottom line: an unjustly forgetten classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Willeford Classic","review":"Ok, you've got this guy Blake, a detective and a real piece of work. Blake gets involved with a real kook of a broad. He mixes business with pleasure and starts thinking with the wrong head. At the end Willeford delivers the kind of twist only he can.

I thought I would see some very useful ideas for our renovation, but there was NOTHING relevant. This book is nice if you just want to see a few obscure chefs in their messy kitchens. There are NO suggestions or examples of design- where to put things and why for example. Definitely nothing innovative or interesting- we've all heard about the work triangle.I highly recommend Lyn Peterson's Real Life Kitchens. I have poured over this book. Packed with information about materials for flooring, countertops, etc. How much space do you need around an island, how much space is recommended for certain items, layout, comfortable working distances between appliances, how much knee room for stool at an island, etc. etc. Also has some very beautiful kitchens that WORK and details WHY. Extremely useful in many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of brilliant ideas that are actually useful!","review":"Finally a book with some \\"meat and potatoes\\" content that is enhanced with beautiful photography and actual floorplans!

I can accept books have errors, and math books in particular, but cannot accept there is no corrections information available to let me know when I've truly done something wrong, or the book has.

Its about as cheap as you can make something without it being total garbage. No where in the description does it say its hollow plastic, and the pictures are low res and small so you don't necessarily realize what you are buying. To stretch leather shoes, you have to apply a pretty fair amount of push, and thats not really possible with this item. Its also priced similarly to toe box stretchers, so its not that great of deal when you realize what you actually bought.I have not bought from FootSmart before, and this first impression leaves much to be desired.

One of the bits was quite sharp but most of them are like cookie crumbs. At first I thought I had sand in my shoe until I looked at the crumbs closely and then tried it on another clean shoe.

The gameplay is not horrible, but certainly nothing to be impressed by. The graphics are very sub-par for the stage at which PS2 games are being developed these days, and there is noticeable frame rate slowdown!! That last one is totally unacceptable. WRC is a much better Rally game, albeit it has many flaws of its own.Steer clear of this game, wait for CMR3 or WRC2... both will be much, much better and you will likely never play this game again once you have one of those two to play.

A phenomenally talented artist, Peacock wrote - and sang - some of the best known and loved material in the free repertoire. Anyone well acquainted with the recordings of Paul Bley, Gary Peacock inter alia will recognise many themes featured on this album. The playing is exemplary - Crispell's faithful interpretations are well supported by Gary Peacock and Paul Motian. Many coming to this recording afresh will find it somewhat astringent - not immediately lovable - but do please make an effort. The moving ballad \\"Both\\" is a good place to start. Certainly to my delight, Annette herself sings on \\"Dreams\\" - a beautiful voice. I felt twenty five years fall away in a moment. I just wish ECM could persuade Ms Peacock to record an entirely sung album of her material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes It Was!","review":"This two-CD set, which sells for the price of one, answers that burning question, \\"What if Anton Webern had started a jazz trio?\\" Well, that's sort of what \\"Nothing ever was, anyway\\" sounds like, anyway. The musical texture is generally quite wispy, with Marilyn Crispell's piano often playing a single note at a time, supported with spare intensity by Gary Peacock's bass and the drums of Paul Motian. The music does not so much flow as probe, but move forward it does--slowly, probingly, inevitably along. This is not music that I can easily recommend to everyone, but to those with ears to hear (those who find the music of Webern and Berg bracing and stimulating from time to time) will find it bracing and stimulating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange but Good","review":"I absolutely LOVED this series as a boy and I loved watching this video as an adult.

There is a BRILLIANTLY directed scene where Psychobomb # 2 tries to gain access to a SHADO submarine but gets no further than the conning tower when the order is given to submerge. This episode also has an unusually strong soundtrack of mysterious music courtesy of the brilliant composer Barry Gray.

But they love them so that is all that matters. The balls are easy for them to grip and have not thrown all of them out of the pool. I also bought the Intex Shady Beach baby Pool (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000BX44DU) and I am awaiting the verdict for that to review.

I was prepared for that so it didn't bother me. Some balls did dent after playing with them. Again, I'm ok with that since they were small dents, not the crushed look. The balls are soft enough for my nephew to toss around. He enjoys swimming in the balls, counting them, reciting the colors, tossing them out of the pit and then chasing after them to clean up his mess. It was a satisfactory purchase. I'm now a little bummed that they're selling it for a couple dollars cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, good value, not super durable","review":"I bought this for my 15 month old son.

Out of the 100 balls, only 19 were in good condition. The other 81 were soft and dented. The balls actually seemed to be made of two different types of plastics. Most of them were a soft, thin plastic. A few, mostly the ones in good condition, seemed to be made of a harder plastic.I contacted the manufacturer about my disappointment. A representative called me the same day she received my letter! She said I should send some balls to their warehouse and they would replace them. I'm about to do that now.

I have played this game with kids, teens, adults, the bright and the not-so-bright; every one has a great time playing.I will say that is best to have people of similar age play together or else the game is skewed in favor of the older person.

So whether you know small words, long words, short words or silly words this game makes vocabulary fun!! For those of us who are poor spellers be sure to keep a dictionary near by for those not-quite-sure moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Any hockey fan should get this game","review":"Hey I got this game for Christmas and it is one of the best hockey games ever made. The puck physics are great (i.e.; the puck never goes through players), the announcer is hilarious, and the controls are simple yet the game isn't too easy. The new franchise mode is great and the mini games are fun to play even with one player. And of course, you can check people through the glass which is great. The fights could use a little work; they are the exact same thing from the 2002 game. The action is smooth; the game never gets choppy and the graphics are great. And of course, the soundtrack is awesome with songs from Hoobastank, Powerman 5000, and Rob Zombie. This is a must for casual and die-hard hockey fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"NHL 2003 has really hit the spot here.

Panasonic Discontinued Battery - w/o it Unit Doesn't Work !!","review":"I purchased the LX9 complete with cradle, external speakers and leather case - for a total of $800 in 2004. Until now I have been very pleased with it. However, the detachable built-in battery has just gone bad. Without it, you cannot play the unit at all - even with mains power ! Panasonic has helpfully discontinued making the battery. So my expensive investment is now quite useless !! All Panasonic is prepared to do is offer me a small discount to buy a new and inferior Panasonic unit with no speakers. My advice to all would-be buyers is : MAKE SURE PANASONIC PLANS TO KEEP MAKING THE BATTERY BEFORE YOU BUY ANY OF THEIR PORTABLE DVD PLAYERS !!! IF NOT - DON'T BUY !!! Sadly, Panasonic has become a company that no longer believes in customer support. I guess it got too big to care any more.

The overall sound quality is better from the Alpines, but the Infinity speakers are a close second! The only way to get more sound is to step up to 6x9's.

They do not meander, but set a groove and dig deeply in, draining of it of all its possibilites.The solos are top notch, and the rhythm section are as tight as I have ever listened to.

As has been mentioned by other reviewers, the HK DVD-25 plays a variety of formats.I would be lying to you if I told you it was the best; there are other DVD players out there that go for even more Benjamins than DVD-25 and likely perform better (such as Denon models and some Onkyo models), but if you're on a budget and you need a high-end DVD player that can muscle a sharp image onto a large HDTV, then Harmon Kardon is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tired of plastic?","review":"This machine is solid, performs well, and very easy to use.

The hard drive part of the camera was good, it sorts out all the videos for you so you can (as what all the advertisements say) keep shooting. The video quality was horrendous, i shot a few short films indoors and i just could not set the lighting right. It came out all fuzzy and the colors were bleak. Poor battery,too. Definitely stay away if you're an independent filmmaker or care at least somewhat about video quality and if you edit video. The editing systems was awful with the way they expected you to use only their drag and drop (lame) software. And transfering video files to the computer was slow thanks to the USB 2.0 and no firewire. It is sleek and small and has a nice video light, but i would caution most consumers to stay away. If you still like what you see, spend the extra $100 or so and get the MG77."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this camera","review":"This camera is a big disappointment.

In addition, the artifacting is multiplied in lowlight conditions.You can use a USB cable to transfer the videos to your computer, to edit them.. but you have to use their software, or you will lose the audio.

What she finds is a cold, distant scientist, a mystery, and an irresistable hunk of an enigma. Heart of the Beast suffers from both an emphasis on the mystery over the romance and the beauty hugging most of the spotlight. The beast seems to spend a lot of time off stage, which makes the romance seem perfunctory, at first. Nonetheless, I warmed to it (being a horror buff at heart, the werewolf slant and gothic mood made it all worthwhile), liked the characters (although I would have liked to have gotten to know Nicholas better sooner rather than later) and found the bad guy easy to hate. So I'm giving it an extra star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent mid-size TV value","review":"I was looking for a nice mid-size TV for my bedroom that had S-Video as well as Component Video Input (CVI).

Prodcuers please reel in the sound effects","review":"This is an average film - the acting and plot are average. However, the trouble is that you cannot really fathom out the plot because of the sound track which seems to find a new, loud and inappropriate sound every 15 seconds. So whilst I agree with the other reviewer about the camera shots, it is the abysmal sound track that repels me. However, this film is one in a long series of new movies that look appealing but are totally destroyed by over zealous sound engineers. It has come to the point where I will not purchase any new DVDs because of it - just revert to the old classics. It is such a pity because some of them are reasonable (e.g. the Shooter) but I want to watch a film; not be constantly distracted and irritated. Have they never heard of the suspension of disbelief?

The most noticeable difference between the two is that Apple's 20\\" LCD has admittedly superior cosmetic styling. This monitor is beautiful, sharp, and crisp and based on personal experience I believe it is brighter than the Apple model as well. Actually this is so bright I had to turn the brightness way down to comfortably use it, whereas on the Apple model I always had it turned all the way up.I actually originally got a 22\\" LG LCD and returned it shortly after purchase and got this instead because of a bad pixel and warped housing. I swear, every time I have tried to get a bigger monitor than 20\\" I have trouble. I wonder if 20\\" is just the sweet spot for large LCD's.

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from something picked up from a music stand in the airport but this blew us both away. This was EXACTLY what we wanted. It was the true blend of gentle Hawaiian music that is popular on Kauai. This is a fantastic CD to relax to and it always brings the memories flooding back for us both.

I abuse my electronics, and I like them to be durable. (Read: I drop my nice things quite often.) But the sound quality on this product is top notch -- and the headphones are very very nice. I also like the red rim (also available in blue). The button configuration is easy to use; all of them are in the right places. But I think the best thing about this player is the fact that you can use two different types of batteries! You can insert two AA or two AAA. There are different battery covers provided to accomodate these different configurations.

Note that the piano was a Baldwin and the picture is rather blurred: it is somewhat like watching TV with your reading glass or even worse. So, sound and picture-wise, it is categorically below the general standard. But there is some music after all as the piano playing is great. For the Rachmaninov, it sounds more like an old piano in disrepair which is badly out of tune: quite annoying or even unbearable to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lights out for Cyclops","review":"I work nights and this light is a great \\"hands-free\\" flashlight when working with equipment in the dark.

So I tried a variety of \\"super glue\\" types of adheasives and none were strong enough to keep it from rebreaking. Now I am left with a small, awkward, hand-held flashlight.

Ever since Mike brought us TBIII his path in music has been downhill. Millennium Bell was terrible, so was Guitars and now this. Perhaps not terrible in the way that he's fresh out of ideas. Perhaps more terrible because some lack of interest seems to be going on. Mike is not a medicore musician by nature, infact it's the other way arround. Therefore it's almost heartbreaking to realize that he chooses to do the things this way. Perhaps he's grown tired of music, but if that's the case, he should refrain and spare us the humility.

Some tracks may sound good, bu others just don't resonate, and anyway most of them are far too long. Before writing this review, I tried to listen to the record at least 4 or 5 times and in the end I didn't even find it really PLEASANT. The more you listen to it, the more boring it tends to get - it doesn't really grow up on you. As to the saxophone he uses, it doesn't fit with the music. That was a very bad idea I think.Had the record come from someone else, I would have called it a deserving effort - not so great but still promising.Yet, it is Mike Oldfield and as he is such an old hand in the business, he should know better than that. Tres Lunas just doesn't stand up to his usual high standards.I'm starting to think he might be dead as a music composer, but doesn't seem to know it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not lyrical","review":"Although I found the story somewhat engaging, Mr. Danner's prose was disjointed and his images unnecessarily coarse. His frequent genital and bowel references were decidedly offputting. I found the language offensive and am confused that it would be described as lyrical. This detracted from any sympathy or empathy I might have had for any of the characters. It was difficult to believe that Mary would be so physically unprepared for her trip. Described as a millionaire twice over, she seems to have brought nothing with her for herself or her patients. This is only one of the many flaws that ran throughout the story. I am giving it two stars only because I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"Mary moves to northern India to work as a doctor in mission hospital. When she arrives she finds that the doctor who called her there has left abruptly to tend to a sick relative. This leaves her in charge of the whole hospital and staff.

I only made it about half way through. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riding on \\"Himalayan\\" name","review":"I picked this up thinking I would find a good read and a cultural experience. Instead I found a disjointed book. His lead character, Mary, a young widow and a doctor for the elderly, whom we should have had a deep compassion for, talked like a longshoresman. The profanity took away from the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Trip!","review":"A good read -- different from anything I have read before. Danner creates a unique setting with lively descriptions and an interesting global jumble of characters whose viewpoints alternate throughout the story. The bleak realities of surgical trauma and austere landscape are the strengths of the book, in addition to some well-drawn personalities. Its weakenesses are the occasionally sloppy prose that fails to match the appropriate speaking \\"voice\\" of an individual character, and what to me was a rather jerky, foreshortened ending that did not do justice to the elegantly bizarre plot and characters. I did find it a fascinating journey of sorts and will add it to the list of independent reading books for my high school World Lit students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyric and emotionally satisfying","review":"After hearing Mr. Danner read excerpts from the first chapter at a local bookstore, I was moved first by the lyric beauty of his writing, then captured by the inner beauty of his story, and the lives which unfold within.Once started, the only reason you would put it down is because you don't want the story to end.The best books, the best stories, take us - teach us - tell us something new.

After our own discussion about the deeper, sinister connotations of ravens, we asked the author his intent. He said the ravens are the Greek Chorus of the book, observing all that the characters experience and offering comment by their actions. I found this fascinating and it really added to my enjoyment of the book. Each character overcomes his/her own circumstances to find enlightenment. I really enjoyed reading about their journey. I loved learning about the culture and religion of the area also.

Although, in my situation, no one's life is at stake. I am a complete \\"Foodie\\" and got very interested in the type of foods that were being discussed in the book. I really liked the turns in the story and the characters were fun to root for (except the kidnapper).

This is one of the first films of hers that I purchased. The scenes about the babies and children being designated to go to earth were extremely helpful when we lost our daughter's full family (5) in a house fire. They were only lent to us for a while! I recommend everyone to view this because we never know what tomorrow will bring!

She finds it at home after all.What I find unique about this movie is its use of the concept of an existence of people before they're born into mortal lives. This is introduced by means of a search for the blue bird in the future. There are several, though a small percentage, of movies that are about people who are reunited in an after-life following the death of the second one, but Blue Bird is the only significant movie that I know of where we look into relationships that are struck up before people are born!It's a delight to watch, & made the more precious because it runs for so little time, relatively speaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fox's answer to MGM's \\"Wizard\\" falls short","review":"20th Century-Fox rushed this fairy tale to the screen following the success of MGM's \\"Wizard of Oz\\". Shirley Temple was turned down for Dorothy and Fox wanted to cash in on the reinvigorated fantasy genre. However, Fox had neither the time, talent and resources to rival MGM's classic.Temple's character is too unlikeable for any connection with the audience, and the fairy tale atmosphere is too heavy handed. Even the switch from Black and White to color is abrupt and without the nuance of the transition in \\"Wizard\\".One note: with all the talk of Christmas in the film, why is there a menorah in the children's bedroom?Beautiful color and costumes cannot save this \\"turkey\\" (oops, I meant to say \\"bird\\")"},{"rating":"1","title":"shirley Temples Blue Bird","review":"Very disappointed.

I feel very bad because she was the greatest actress and she was still adorable at the age of12 .I don't really understand why people say she was stiff exactly. She dances to Laydeo with her grandfather while she visits them.Don't get me wrong though, I thought the movie was quite good until the color part the rest was junk.

This is not a movie that you would want to own..... I would recommend renting it instead (if you must). The setting is dark, and depressing, the story-line appears to have been thrown together haphazardly, and the costumes for the fantasy characters are cheap (I've seen better costumes in a local school play).

No real reason is given.the script is poor and pathetic. The lines these children were made to say makes me shutter...Someone raved about the grandma scene..

The storyline is awful and without Shirley singing or dancing there is nothing to salvage this film.There is no chemistry in the cast as there normally is with Shirley and why Fox cast Shirley in this film is beyond me-- Who wants to see the adorable Temple play and a mean and selfish girl???Temple fans like me will like it just because, it has Temple in it but, those looking for family fun buy \\"Baby Take A Bow\\", \\"Bright Eyes\\" or \\"Poor Little RIch Girl\\" instead this not Shirley at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE MOVIE,,,Be warned","review":"I don't think I have ever seen such a tacky, low budget offering in my life. This movie had a confusing, boring storyline, phoney looking settings...and here's the kicker...there is no real Bluebird in the whole thing. The packaging tricks you. Obviously they graphically inserted a real Bluebird in Shirley Temple's hand for the DVD. And,the Bluebird is only seen briefly in the very end. Sadly, this was made back before animals were treated humanely by Hollywood. It looks as if they spray-painted the poor bird blue. He doesn't look too healthy to me. (I don't know if you're aware of it, but for example, Tarzan really did kill the lion in the old Tarzan movie.) I imagine this bird didn't live long after that scene. I bought this movie for my Granddaughter, because she loves The Wizard of Oz,,,but to mention W of Oz in the same sentence with this movie is an abomination.

The dire shame of this project is that the recording itself is full of drop-outs, momentary loss of channels, hiss, and wow/flutter. These scars aren't present on all tracks, but are on many of them (including the momumental Passacaglia -- particularly at the trimphant climax!). I don't know if these recording problems were on the original 1964 LP release or occurred in the CD mastering process, but, in all my decades of listening to all types of music, I have NEVER heard a commercially-released recording with such fundamental technical errors.

Baloney, the quality is somewhere between VHS and the movies you can take with your digital still camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early technology but decent camera","review":"I don't think the camera is worth the 400 dollars, but it is a decent HARD DRIVE camera nonetheless. One of the major drawbacks is that you need great light sources to have an excelent shot. In addition, the proprietary .mod extension files only play on the given software. Be ready to know how to produce the clips and turn them into a playable mpeg or mpeg2 files if you want to share these files with family and friends. The major advantage is not having to buy all kinds of tapes. This is simply a camera for the the Dad or the soccer Mom who want to have movies of their kids.

I toyed around with it in the store and it seemed like a great idea. I brought it home to shoot my sons 3rd birthday and when we turned the lights off and lit the sparklers for the cake this camcorder struggled to even stay in focus, let a lone get a decent shot of the action. I was willing to chalk this up to the low lighting conditions.My next shoot was a x-mas recital for my other boy. The lighting was pretty good at this event and the recording quality was still pretty poor. My next shoot was back at my house. I had six canlights and a fan with 2 bulbs on at the same time. This was not enough light to shoot without the gain up feature. The gain up feature causes the images to have a greyish washed out cast. I ended up returning this camera on the following Monday.If you are going to use this cam in only outdoor sunny conditions or in a brightly lit Best Buy, DON'T GET IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider Something Else","review":"I purchased this a few months ago, and am not very happy with it. Operationally and functionally it works fine. However, I'm not at all happy with the quality of the videos/pictures. I had a small digital I bought for $125 and the video quality is the same. Also, even after making the adjustments and settings recommended for low-light and indoor photography, it is not very good. And then, you have to reset for outdoors, then reset for indoors, etc. If it involved one or two adjustments, it would be fine but it's a lot of hassle for poor quality you end up with. Also, this just may be me, but it's so light when you use zoom it's very hard to hold it steady and the image then gets blurred like it's out of focus. For a $500 range camera, I would look at something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"The overall look of the film is dull enough to turn off those who are looking for a good documentary. The narration is dull and Monty and the narrator keep stating things like ('This wasn't staged' and 'this horse really did get tame'). Much of the narration consists of Monty and the main narrator insisting that the methods works, it wasn't staged, etc, etc...almost as if they had some insecurities about the methods themselves! The transition from scene to scene is choppy and the cinematography is lame. Some of the lines during the whole release thing with Shy Boy seemed rehearsed, such as Tara's emotionless insistence that Shy Boy will come back...a very dull film. You'll regret it.

A lot of these stories are notable and fun to read due to their surprise endings. You will marvel at Clarke's ability to do this. Some of the best cuts from this book include the title story (which has launched quite a scientific following), Reunion, and the multitple award-winning novella A Meeting With Medusa which is an undeniable Clarke classic that almost makes the book worth buying on it's merit alone.

I was very disappointed with this one. There are several design flaws that prevent it from locking your tailgate. The biggest one is that the whole mechanism is secured with one screw that allows the locking arm to rotate down (thus unlocking the tailgate) with very little effort on the tailgate handle. I thought I could fix that with a tack weld on the lock. Even when welded solid, the tailgate opens very easily in the locked position.

So when this lock is activated, a little amount of effort with one hand is enough to force the tailgate open. On top of that, the lock isn't flush with the bezel. Partly my own fault, it came with a one-way screw to attach the lock to the tailgate, so the junk won't be coming off any time soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Install","review":"Amazon's picture is a little miss leading, the photo does not show this kit comes with a lock cylinder but it does! The tailgate lock installed easily. I really like how the cylinder lock actually locks the linkage the tailgate handle attaches to, my 04 Dodge Dakota has a plastic tailgate handle. I had tried the more expensive pop-n-lock tailgate lock which did not work at all because it used a single latch that only latched on the far right side of the tailgate lock so when I lifted on the left side of the tailgate even when locked the tailgate still opened. The Bully tailgate lock doesn't have this problem since it secures the metal linkage the tailgate lock attaches too. Long story short this is a great product, I give it two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter Bach's choral music here.","review":"It is good to see that Vanguard are successfully remastering and reissuing so many of their classic recordings. This one comes up very well (belying its 1957 vintage), and is recommended to those who are interested in beginning an exploration of Bach's choral music.Performance styles of baroque music currently undergo rapid change. Here, operatic voices and animated chorus combine with an orchestra of modern instruments. Anton Heiller is the organist. The sound is rich, of the highly resonant Viennese type.The tiny cantata \\"Nun ist das Heil und die Kraft\\" is a knock out. A four minute fragment for double chorus and large orchestra, proceeding in strong march rhythm, it makes an unforgettable impact."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the words?","review":"This gets wonderful reveiws - so why are so many of the words I want to look up not in it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNEVEN","review":"I look with suspicion at anything that Spielberg lays his hand upon.

First of all Speilberg spends the whole first 1 1/2 hour stating and restating the self evident truth that slavery was wrong. O.K so just how guilty is the white audience supposed to feel before enough is enough? Secondly Speilberg evidently has no quams about rewriting history so long as it pushes his P.C. agenda. In reality Adams and the blacks he was defending never met, and they(blacks) never sat foot inside of a courtroom. Another of Speilbergs interesting oversights is that the lead character(i forgot his name) after being set free form the evil shackles of slavery, returned to Africa and and participated in the slave trade. If this trend continues I wonder what goofy bunk he'll try next? Maybe he can remake a \\"historically accurate\\" WWII movie where the Japanese won."},{"rating":"1","title":"a white feel good film","review":"Steven Speielberg is a very talent film-maker but he sinks on this film.i'm wanting Morgan Freeman's character&Dijimon Hounsou charater to have more pressence but not here.they have no voice.but the characters of Anthony Hopkins&Matthew Mcconaughey have to save the day.typical of Hollywood.always have to smooth things out when something serious is going on and the voice that needs to be heard is silent or forced to be Soft.it's a crying shame.every voice deserves to be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"irreal and soft","review":"This isn't a good movie. As Spanish I don't complaint of the cruelty of other Spanish of past centuries.

For the really interested I strongly recommend two master adventure novels by Pio Baroja a superb author well liked by Hemingway that almost won the Nobel prize. These are titled \\"Adventures of Captain Chimista\\" and \\"Pilots of high Seas\\" both written about 1900, and you really will know that truly Spanish fearless trafficant of slaves - between other many illegal and inmoral bussines- used to do withouth censorship.

The acting was superb, the storyline engrossing, and the ending touching and exhilirating. Highly recommended for those who enjoy historical dramas and for those who enjoy movies about important Supreme Court cases.While the scenes on the slave ship were horrifying to say the least, this is an important story that needs to be remembered for centuries to come.

It was definitely an eye opener to me as to how African slaves were treated. The performances from the actors was incredible. Cinque was an extremely important character and was often portrayed as being 'Christ-like'. He was often seen in light and in the court room scenes he was wearing light coloured clothes. Cinque was also seen as the 'head' of the other black slaves. They all looked up to him and admired him. Due to the technique of lighting, the viewer is shown that Cinque and the other slaves are the 'good', and the Americans are the 'bad'. Characters in the film who were siding with the Africans were all seen in light, while others, for example the Spanians, were seen in dark lighting.Overall, I feel that Spielberg did a fantastic job with this film and the technique of lighting was very effective in portraying certain views to the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Melodramatic courtroom drama disguised as slave history","review":"This movie could be really good if it focused on the Middle Passage. The brief segement on the slave ship was by far the best sequence in the film. But the rest of the movie is dull, sappy, and overblown.Also, its not very historically accurate. This is not a problem dramatically (\\"Nixon\\" for example:great drama, horrible history), but its a personal pet peeve of mine. Also, as a history teacher, I find it disturbing that teachers were encouraged to use the film for educational purposes when it was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly awful - but not unexpected.","review":"This movie would have succeeded if it had starred Eddie Murphy, Richard Pryor, Steve Martin, Leslie Nielson and Dan Ackroyd. It's so appallingly acted, scripted and directed that it amounts to a laughable parody of a 'serious' subject matter. An exercise in sickly false sentiment with the requisite maudlin musical score that has become Spielberg's unmistakable trademark.It is really nothing more than a boring - and equally badly made - derivative of the TV mini-series 'Roots' that was inflicted on us some 20 years ago. A cynical and inevitably failed attempt by Spielberg to gain recognition, legitimacy, and status as an auteur filmmaker. He should stick to what he does best: catering to his uncritical and adoring fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"In my video collection of more than 100 titles, this film is by far my favorite.

In my opinion, Steven Spielberg's best work so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Armistad","review":"Very good film, needed this in DVD version to show to our Sunday school children on movie night and an excellent price, thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must See","review":"Amistad is a true story about an 1839 mutiny aboard a slave ship that is traveling towards North America. It is a story in the period when new slaves were illegal, but trading in slaves that were already slaves, was allowed. With a powerful all-star cast including Morgan Freeman, Anthony Hopkins and Matthew McConaughey, it is a story that will grip your heart and move your spirit. Much of the story takes place in a courtroom drama about the free-man who led the revolt, and deals with questions of freedom, humanity and dignity.The movie, though slow moving, is intense, and the drama builds as many groups claim the slaves as their property. This story is truly gripping and a story of extreme importance in understanding our own history. This lesser-known Spielberg film is truly a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie!","review":"I read the review from the professional critic and thought he was being a little over dramatic; it was a \\"great\\" history lesson because without this movie I might have never known about these past events, and I was entertained while informed.

It may seem like an over-simplification to some but I think it's right in line with Spielberg's story telling style and it was Condensed/simplified as needed for the format of the medium. The imagery was powerful. It had some fun moments for those interested in languages and issues that surface with interpretation and working with interpreters.I had some trouble with the streaming rental on my Roku player, it kept skipping, getting stuck and crashed twice. After rebooting I had some stuttering on playback but it eventually stopped. I'm not sure if the problem was on Amazon's end or my end but though it was worth mentioning in case others are having these issues.

This movie relies on the viewer having a strong sense of entitlement and thus being aloof of the less than subtle insults aimed at caucasians. The film notes the African's language had not developed abstract words such as \\"if\\". The script tells us the Africans are morally superior and thus their language does not need the word \\"IF\\". Because \\"you either do something or you don't\\", the African leader sagely informs us. Who are the buffoons in this film? The Christians who devote their time to protest against slavery are depicted as useless and referred to as \\"those miserable people\\".

Spielberg has formulated beautiful scenes in this masterpiece that invoke thought in the heart of man. The performance of Djimon Hounsou deserved best supporting actor, as he portrayed one of the most powerful humans in motion picture history, and all the time speaking no English. It was an unforgettable performance, and definetely better than a movie about a sinking boat, a movie about a confused writer, or any of the other ill-rewarded movies of the year.Superlative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spielberg does another one by the numbers","review":"Once again Speilberg shows that he knows how to push the buttons -- right from the opening scene, where the action is illuminated by lightning flashes at unrealistically short intervals. Go for the reptile brain with those flashing lights, Steve. Where this movie finally lost it for me, though, was in the courtroom. Why would Spielberg hire one of the world's great actors (Anthony Hopkins) to play one of America's great orators, have him deliver a wonderful speech, and then paste a syrupy musical soundtrack over the whole thing? This seems to me typical of the director's work -- his estimation of us is that we lack the intelligence or emotional depth to frame our own reactions to events, so he manipulates us with flashing lights and elevator music. Unfortunately, judging by the customer ratings this and other movies of his have received, his estimate of the majority of movie-goers is correct."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT FILM THAT WAS UNFORTUNATLEY OVERSHADOWED.","review":"AMISTAD in my opinion should have won all of the awards TITANIC won. It accuratley potrays the horror of what slavery really was from the slave ships to the actual buying and selling of people. I thought that ANTHONY HOPKINS acting performance in this film was better than anyone's in TITANIC , as well as MORGAN FREEMAN'S too. It is unfortunate this movie came out at the same time as TITANIC because it was too overshadowed by the latter and it's a shame too. I felt that STEVEN SPEILBERG did an outstanding job on this film and deserved the best director award not JAMES CAMERON, anyway see this movie you'll see why I feel this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amistad, not to forget, a movie to see","review":"One of Spielberg's finer films, Amistad is actually based on a true story about the human beings right or lack of to live free. The movie started out on a slave ship when the Africans that had been enslaved broke free and revolted. After being mislead by the two Spanish survivors, the Africans landed on American soil. Their landing then ensued one of the most controversial and historically significant series of court battles in the United States history.Spielberg does an excellent job portraying the struggle for the Africans freedom. With some nice shots and some good actors the movie does the struggle over the Amistad some good justice. Speaking of actors, Djimon Hounsou does a superb job acting as the reluctant leader of the Africans. Also, Matthew McConaughey does an equally excellent job as the first lawyer for the Africans. Although I tend to dislike Spielberg, he made a movie which all should see. A nice 4 out of 5 star job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, I liked it anyway...","review":"The staff reviewer for Amazon sure hated this movie, but I enjoyed it as a courtroom drama, based on a true case, from the early years of the USA. The slave defendants were serious underdogs in this battle, after having seized the ship which was bringing them to the New World and a new, unwanted life of misery. The case challenged America's fresh ideas as embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution: in a country which recently fought for the freedom of its own white citizens, yet allowed Negro slavery, could Negroes themselves fight for freedom before becoming owned by U.S. citizens? This is no masterpiece a viewer will want to enjoy again and again, but it is no waste of two hours on a snowy evening either. It engages heart and mind in a few profound political and religious questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GOOD FILM","review":"This film will move you to tears!

Like most of L'Engle's non-fiction the book combines Christianity, social commentary, personal stories, poetry, and the spark that illuminates so many of L'Engle's books. To L'Engle, Penguins are icons and Golden Calves are idols. Each chapter focuses on a specific subject and ties it to spirituality. One chapter focuses on the importance of words, another on Abba, and another on Amma.

The case studies were interesting and it all made sense (ie the problems of imbalance) until it came to the diet info. Information I read beforehand indicates that generally fruit and veg are alkaline and meat/fish/bread are acid. This book confused me with listings showing contradictory info. It may well be about a certain type of diet that helped people but I cannot find one other piece of evidence to support his listings of WHICH foods are acid and alkaline (in fact, completely opposite in most cases) so it just left me very confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"BioBalance","review":"Before purchasing this book I'd check it out of the library.

It's not that the author is wrong in his stipulation that pH balance in the body may be the most important aspect of health and nutrition; however, 1.) he takes a very narrow view of a large picture, and 2.) he doesn't help you gain an understanding of balancing pH in your body.

All you do to install, is hold up one side of the pet door to the screen, cut the screen, leaving some slack to attach to the pet door, then snap the other side on. No need to remove your door to install the pet door (as stated in instructions).The complaint that I have about this thing is the locking feature. If you lock the pet door, your pet can easily just push the whole pet door through the screen (the pet door casing and all).

I don't think the locking feature works very well. The door can be pushed right out. Instead we followed another reviews advice and installed it in the middle of the door so that we can close the glass door half way so we can stop the dogs from going out if we don't want them to, but still let the fresh air in.

Rap isn't about the lyrics...r i i i g h t. It's about the beats. If that's true then what purpose do the lyrics serve in the first place? Well?

I'm sure he does. Anyway, the album ,lyrically, is wicked. The beats by the Neptunes are more impressive than ever. Pharell should be Snoop's producer for life.My favorite tracks areSnoop D-O- Double GPerfectGirl Like UOh NoDrop It Like It's HotLet's Get Blown.I was very impressed with the album.

I hope that Snoop Dogg goes and stays in the same track. He is doing great out their right now.I hope Let's Get Blown gets out. It, in my mind, is the second best on the album.

Although it didn't really fade him (despite establishing a couple haters here and there), he returns full force with his 7th solo album \\"R&G: The Masterpiece\\". Since his last work was too crossover, I figured since it was produced by The Neptunes it would be even worse. But of course I was wrong. There's actually some Westcoast stuff on here. \\"Fresh Pair of Panties On\\" is where he shows his g-funk roots. One thing that worries me is that Justin Timberlake, that wannabe wigga from NSYNC is on \\"Can I Get A Flicc Wit U\\". Is every rapper in the industry gettin cool with this wigga off of Mickey Mouse Club? At least he get's gangsta gangsta with his nephew 50 Cent on \\"Oh No\\", and shows Snoop Doggy Dogg on \\"No Thang On Me\\". \\"Don't Be Greedy\\", the catch-phrase for the song \\"Pass It Pass It\\" explains it all.

I can't tell if he was high when he was writing his lyrics or if he has just become retarded, but all his rhyming abilities have left him, so he just adds an \\"-izzle\\" to the end of every word so he can rhyme any words he wants. Here is a little sample straight from \\"Drop it Like It's Hot,\\" the worst song of 2004. Enjoy.\\"So don't change the dizzle, turn it up a littleI got a living room full of fine dime brizzlesWaiting on the Pizzle, the Dizzle and the ShizzleG's to the bizzack, now ladies here we gizzo\\"Wow.

Its like driving in a lowrider when the transmission is slipping but when Snoop hits the track \\"Fresh Pair of Panties on\\" it's smooth sailing from then on,no potholes.

That being said, I must say that I'm really feelin' this album. Snoop seems to have certain chemistry with the Neptune's that other artists don't enjoy. I actually copped this album from a bootlegger and liked it so much that I proceeded to plunk down $9.99 at Best Buy to have an official copy.

Snoop hasn't been the same since he and Dre split. I don't know why everybody thinks just because he signed w/Startrak (or however how it's spelled) it's a hot album. It just goes to show how people are under the belief that just because something is different it's good. well guess what people, sometimes you gotta stick w/what got you there.

In Snoop's hit \\"Drop it like it's hot,\\" he explains to us that he drives his own cars and wears his own clothes. Good job dude. When he can't think of anything better to say, he talks about AK's and killing. When he can't rhyme something he goes the fashizzle route. Hip Hop died a long time ago and the stuff that's coming out now is just the corpse of a once-decent genre.

This is what Ja Rule wishes his album was like and this is truly Snoop Dogg at his worst. Is it just me or does he just get worse with every album? Oh and while i'mn still here why does everyone think this is his best album? You'll notice that everyone who says that's favourite song is always something like Drop It Like It's Hot or Signs.

Because of MTV dumbass kids think this is great and Snoop Dogg is talented. He could be but in all his songs you never hear him sing or play any instrument. He just talks to an annoying repetetive beat. At least he's better than 50 Cent. MTV sucks. Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, Hilary Duff, and many more talentless people are rich because of it. Local bands and musicians are way more talented and original. Look at a very talented punk band, NOFX they have never been on MTV or even on the radio yet they still made it in music because they have TALENT. The deserve their career.

I thought Doggy Style was a stellar album, however his subsequent work seemed marred by his personal beef with Suge Knight, criminal charges, and search for a record label that he could call home. That being said, I must say that I'm really feelin' this album. Snoop seems to have certain chemistry with the Neptune's that other artists don't enjoy. I actually copped this album from a bootlegger and liked it so much that I proceeded to plunk down $9.99 at Best Buy to have an official copy. My only negative comment about the CD pertains to the cut with Lil Jon and Trina (Step Yo Game Up). This has to be one of the most ignorant songs that I have ever heard in my entire life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoop fell off long time ago!","review":"Come on let's be real Snoop is not what he was on his death row days, he fell off. this album is not good at all, i'm not feelin it. but if you are die hard snoop fan then i guess you'll like it.OUTLAW"},{"rating":"1","title":"HELLO?

I can't believe the reviews other people have posted. I grew up on rap and hip hop, and i have to say, Snoop Dog's latest release is just plain boring. I must confess that i do not listen to Snoop's stuff on a regular basis, so this cd was the first one of his that i have bought. Based on this cd, I think I'm probably finished buying his stuff. The only song I enjoyed on this album was the song with Pharell that is played on MTV all the time. You see, even that song was so mideocre that i can't even remember the name! This album has nothing of interest, the beats are uninteresting, boring, and not energetic at all. The lyrics are definately nothing special, I've heard much better. And the background music lacks melody, energy, originality, and plain interestingness. If you're shopping around for a rap cd I would look into Madvillain, an underground rapper who's lyrics, beats, and background music is fresh and captivating.

I appreciate this one Snoop, I've been playing it back to back like you could play albums in the old days. When the album first came out on iTunes, I was going to see if there were a few good tracks, but when I was done listening to the previews I jumped up and down and went upstairs to wake my wife, \\"Snoop has done it!\\" I exclaimed.

The author gives a great deal of attention to why I would want to generate a database or Oracle-driven website but barely touches on how.

These will entertain preschoolers up through junior high and the script is very closely based on the scriptural account. Each video is 45-50 minutes long.

Transfer is as good as can be expected but for some reason is incomplete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a lot of \\"giggles!\\"","review":"Although there is some slashing and strangling going on, I consider this movie to be more of a comedy. The strangler has some real crazy lines and the bodies mount up. I liked the movie and consider it entertaining in a rather crude way. The stranglers' \\"she's asking for it\\" was something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review from the Synthesis","review":"After Maladroit, a majority of Weezer's core fanbase went AWOL. However, as with most bands whose heads swell with the vanities of rock stardom, Weezer have returned with a follow-up that is a distinct return to normalcy; or rather, a return to their revolutionary blueprint of soaring melodies and infectious pop hooks. \\"This Is Such a Pity\\" embraces the fleeting new-wave/pop-punk symbiosis, sated with longing lyrics and pulsing rhythms. \\"Pardon Me\\" emerges as Rivers Cuomo's attempt at reconciliation with all those he's wronged with the line \\"I know that I can be the meanest person in the world,\\" leaping out like some treasured confession that's for your eyes only. Though Make Believe still deviates from past albums like Pinkerton, it's easy to tell that this is probably the group's most honest effort in years.- Ryan PradoSynthesis.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Make Believe\\" made me a believer again.","review":"I have always been a Weezer fan, but this album really made me see how awesome this group really is. If you're not sure about buying it, listen to the previews. It's really an awesome album, and the previews only show a hint of album five's greatness.The album starts off great with \\"Beverly Hills\\", the catchy first single that's all over MTV and the radio, and just gets better. Some favorites of mine include \\"Hold Me\\" and \\"Freak Me Out\\". The songwriting is simplistic yet there is so much underneath the lyrics. The band plays each song with emotion and intensity, and you can hear it. This is definitely an album that should be in any Weezer, or rock, fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just What I Needed.","review":"Forgive the Cars reference, please, because it has no real bearing on the rest of this review.I'll start out by mentioning that I honestly was not expecting an album of this caliber. While it's no Blue Album or Pinkerton, Make Believe carries its own kind of quality through its twelve tracks. Some notable standouts include \\"Pardon Me\\", which is an open and honest \\"apology-in-song-form\\" that contains one of the album's greatest climaxes; \\"Perfect Situation\\", which has often been billed as one of Weezer's best songs since Pinkerton; \\"Haunt You Everyday\\", one of the best Weezer melodies on an album. With its simplistic yet openly honest lyrics, Make Believe is a huge step in the right direction for the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same Band, five different albums","review":"Make Believe, Weezer's 5th album, is an awesome album. Unlike Rolling Stone's review of the new album, it is dissimilar to Pinkerton, Blue, or any other albums. The new album has a unique sound, focusing on River's vocals more than the organic screeching of electric guitars. The vocals on this album may be the best yet. Most of the songs hold more meaning than some previous Weezer songs. The album is a little less rock than alternative compared to other albums, but Weezer is still, by far, a rock band. I would recommend this album to any Weezer fan, young or old, and to any new listeners. =w="},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"I've been a long time Weezer fan, but this album is definately the worst so far. First time I heard Beverly Hills I became skeptical about the new album. Listening to the entire album now I find most of the songs aren't very catchy, lyrics are weaker than usual, and nothing really stands out on the entire album. Definately a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sicky Sucky Sucky","review":"All I can say is that this is the worst cd by weezer ever released. Whats up with the crappy 80's metal guitar solos Rivers. They were so much better when they released thier debut. You can tell their manager told them what to write and to write it like all the other crappy music going around these days. Weezer sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer's comeback album?","review":"Hardcore and nouveau fans alike have been waiting years for Weezer's \\"comeback\\" album. Well folks, the wait has finally ended. No, this album might not top the Blue and Pinkerton die-hard fans' lists, but by all rights, it definitely tops green and Maladroit. This album doesn't sway too heavily either way (rock/pop); in fact, Make Believe has something for every fan. It has those catchy pop songs of blue and green, the emotion of Pinkerton, and even the crunchy riffs of Maladriot. Don't let the new single \\"Beverly Hills\\" throw you, the rest of album has a different feel altogether. The band's dynamics have changed over the years, and so has their music. Cuomo has said that he is trying to reach new audiences, so if you've yet to check out the band,or want to experience Cuomo's new mindset, check out Make Believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock On!","review":"If you're in the hunt for weezer's comeback record, or just a really good cd to listen to, this is it! Make Believe is a flash back to the past, with a modern twist that always leaves you wanting more. All together the album has a very soothing, \\"only in dreams\\"-ish feeling, with some songs leaving you mesmerized, and others, screaming for more. Each song has it's own personality and feeling, which makes the album so great to listen to. I love being able to groove along to the beat of \\"Beverly Hills\\", and sit back and relax with the dynamic piano riffs of \\"Hold Me\\". This is definitely some of weezer's best work to date. It's got those pounding rhythms and catchy lyrics that remind me of the blue album and pinkerton, with some nice maladroit-style guitar solos mixed in. Whether you are a long time weezer fan, or an up-and-comer looking for a great cd, this album is it. You won't be disappointed, and will never be bored with this cd. It a definite must-buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, per se....","review":"... Unfortunately, the only thing worse than a bad album is a mediocre album, and \\"Make Believe\\" is horrendously middle-of-the-road. This band has the potential for greatness- just listen to Blue or, yes, Pinkerton - but somewhere along the winding path of their career, they seem to have decided that blandness is more fulfilling. And I have to give them this: if dull is what they were aiming for, they've definitely succeeded. Even the Green Album had its own particular charm (well, it was catchy, at least), but \\"Believe\\" lacks any sort of personality altogether. The big, bombastic riffs of the Blue era are there, but, when coupled with the modern gloss of overproduction, the effect is oddly soulless. But hey, at least it sells, right?P.S. \\"Beverly Hills\\" is a high point. Translation: Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the wait","review":"This is a valiant effort from Weezer. Most people probably wouldn't think so, but if you really listen, you can hear some sublte tones and sounds that really make the songs stand out.The first 5 songs are pretty O.K. Although, I really like \\"This is such a pity,\\" very 80's sounding, and kinda un-weezer sounding... but good sounding.The 4 stars really go to the last 7 songs on the album. \\"Pardon me\\" and \\"Best friend\\" are probably two of the best songs weezer have ever written! I can't keep from nodding my head to these 2 songs. \\"Freak me out\\" is a nice smooth song, sorta comparable to \\"In dreams\\" from Blue. The last song, \\"Haunt you every day\\" is really great ballad! And is a very nice song to end on.Overall... the album is a good one. And I really do think they put some good effort into it. Kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their best","review":"After first listening to this, I was a mite upset. It seemed a bit more emo and whiny than I would have liked. I mean, these guys are WEEZER! How bad can life possibly be?It's been a month with this album played pretty much daily. I gotta say, it grows on you. The first track is comparable to the foot stomping music of Blue, and most of the rest of the album covers familiar ground touched on in Pinkerton. The second track, Perfect Situation, (although the begining sounds like more than one of their other songs) is the best on the album. Rivers's voice shows excellent range, vocally and mentally with the lyrics.If you like Weezer, you already own it. If you hate Weezer, why are you reading this review?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps celebacy was not the answer...","review":"Lets face it, we've all been waiting for this album for a very long time. Frankly, the songs on this album range from mediocre to just plain bad. The lyrics show poor craftmanship,not just for Weezer, but, for any artist. The only reason it even got my 2 stars was because I love Weezer and was overjoyed at any glimps of their past glory. However, the song about being on drugs was terrible, I mean, most people could write better on drugs, I felt like I was listening to a fourth grader's lyrics. Thus, the downward spiral continues in \\"Make Believe,\\" its sad, but true..."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously","review":"a 5 star review would mean that this cd is perfect......far from it.I guess it's good to people who haven't heard much other than mainstream music.There is nothing going on here that we haven't heard 10000 times before, and they aren't even making it interesting. These guys should thank MTV, because without them no one would give a crap about them right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"no no no no no","review":"please dont buy this. if your a weezer fan, you wont be after this. no no no no no. invest your money into something useful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"phhht!","review":"this cd SUCKED! there was like only 2 songs i liked on it and the rest of it was just STUPID! they only sing about \\"dark things and being hurt\\". i mean that is just PUTHETIC! you might like this stuff if you were into the 80's but im not so PHHHT!oh! beverly hills rocks out loud though"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ALBUM EVER","review":"WHAT HAPPENED!?!?!

This album is the kind of schlock that makes high school kids think they're \\"emo\\". It's plain, boring, and completely annoying. The guitar parts are completely pre-packaged, the lyrics are uninspired, and it's nothing that hasn't been done before. I bought this album with a certain amount of anticipation. I mean, come on, nameless faceless reviewers placed on the overwrap call it \\"Important as the Blue Album and the Green Album\\". You have got to be kidding me. If anything, this album is a career killer. I certainly WON'T be buying a Weezer album without listening to it first EVER again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not that bad!","review":"Well, to start with, I belong to the people who consider the blue album and pinkerton to be the greatest weezer cd's, and perhaps the only 2 cd's (plus make believe of course) by weezer i still put on.But the sad fact is that people who talks s#%/&t; about this cd are the ones who can't accept that weezer has gone mainstream. Everyone listen to it and that disturbs all the musical experts out there who can't enjoy anything that a 13 year old girl enjoys.As for the cd, it's packed with catchy melodies, emotion and riffs that hit you right in the heart. So get over it and take it for what it is: A god poprock CD by one of the classic groups who still has the desire to create good music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Euhh","review":"This wasent the best CD ever...some songs were boring, some were ok.

Because of that, listening to their songs is more of a CHORE than entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer ...Make Believe....not good","review":"Make Believe has a few catchy hooks, but Rivers seems to try and go a little darker on the musical and lyrical side. It doesn't work for this band. They are more of a pop band than anything.I really like the Blue, Green and Pinkerton albums. This album is definitely battling with Maladroit as Weezer's worst album. It's too bad because I really want to like it.It doesn't offer much for the listener. Maybe they should start writing songs as a band and not let Rivers have so much control."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Weez","review":"Weezer's newest release, Make Believe, is a great CD. A lot of the songs on the album are in the vein of previous releases such as \\"The Green Album\\" and \\"Maladroit\\"(both exceptional CDs). With the exception of the dull \\"Freak Me Out\\", the song list is flawless. \\"Beverly Hills\\", \\"We are all on Drugs\\", \\"My Best Friend\\", \\"Peace\\" and \\"Perfect Situation\\" are the highlights of the album and will be playing in your mind endlessly. While not quite \\"The Blue Album\\", Make Believe is still a highly enjoyable listening experience perfect for any veteran Weezer fan(such as myself)or any new fan of the Weez. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer is dead","review":"Weezer had a brilliant debut. They had quite possibly one of the greatest albums of all time after that. But Rivers feared Pinkerton. Make Believe is their worst album to date. Many people say that they fell off at the Green Album. For the record, I didn't think Green and Maladroit were that bad. However, I have not even been able to stomach listening to Make Believe all the way through. Green and Maladroit were bad for Weezer albums (though on their own, they were decent albums). Make Believe is just plain bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lamer and Lamer","review":"People need to face the fact that since Pinkerton, Weezer's albums have gotten steadily worse. I was excited to buy the new Weezer album when this came out, but was thoroughly disappointed. Counting Maladroit that makes two disappointments in a row. I don't know if I'll be buying Weezer's next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"increadible*@&@@(@@","review":"ive been a weezer fan for quite sometime now,following their very album release closely.having said dat i must say this is their best album .with songs like perfect situation and were all on drugs wat more could a hardcore fan ask for.beverly hills is ok ,but i think the other r far better.so u must pick a copy of this album.i did and dun regret it,if u see any negative reviews about the band ignore ,they are all just the band haters who cant stand people listening to some good music.i wish i could rate this item 7 stars but newayz i think ive spoken my mindpeace out to all the weezer fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre-- skip it","review":"It's not horrible. Just like Chek cola isn't horrible. It's just not Coke. For a band that's had such depth and creativity (see Blue Album and Pinkerton) this is a comparatively weak effort. Most of the tracks (Peace, Pardon Me, Perfect Situation, Hold Me, etc) seem sincere and open, which is a step in the right direction, but they're overworked, dull, and a bit whiny. They just aren't catchy or interesting. Other tracks (Drugs, Beverly Hills) just seem like halfhearted, blatant attempts at hit singles. I think 'The Other Way' is the only really good song on here. I think they tried, for the most part, but Weezer seems kind of lost. Spend your dough on Pinkerton and the 2 disc version of The Blue Album, not on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Maladroit","review":"I was a little suspect about the poppiness of \\"Beverly Hills\\" the solo is great & I was hoping they wouldn't do a \\"Maladroit\\" advertise & play some single that leads a lot to be desired with seldom moments of grace (more disgrace though).However, I am pleased to say this album is actually all good.The only song I do not like is \\"We Are All On Drugs\\". Beverly Hills gets a little tiresome too.But overall for an album with really 1 not so good song is a major, well a vast improvement for Weezer.It's actually worth the dough this time around.Cheers guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE Weezer, but...","review":"This is my least favorite album from them. The only songs I care to listen to are \\"Beverly Hills\\", \\"This is Such a Pity\\", \\"Hold Me\\", \\"Perfect Situation\\" and \\"We Are All On Drugs\\" (or in other words, all of the radio singles). Everything else is just not worth listening too, IMO. I own every album and most of their CD singles and I love the first 4 albums (Maladroit is quite good, after a few listens), with my favorites being Blue and Pinkerton. Green is very pop, but still rocking.Lets hope their new album in 2008 will be better than this one. I was honestly expecting more out of them, especially with Rick Rubin producing...maybe they should have had Ric Ocasek produce it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Went Wrong","review":"it seems to me every album after pinkerton gets worse and worse.they used to be such a great band but now they totally suck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Rivers... where have you gone?","review":"When you listen to Weezer nowadays, all you hear is an attempt of 80s revival good ol' rock music, not Weezer. Weezer started out great: blue, and Pinkerton. Then, something called \\"The Green Album\\" happened, and it all dropped short from there.\\"Make Believe\\" is another Weezer album that drops once again in ratings, with it's deadly brothers Green and Maladroit.It seems as though bad music has taken over Rivers, and he's not the geeky alternative rocker he was back in 1994 or 1996."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is trash","review":"ok i know bands are supposed to evolve into newer sounds. however, they've completely lost that gritty sound that made them so appealing, the lyrics are mediocre at best (esp bev. hills & we are all on drugs are painful to listen to) and the album lacks the intensity of several of the previous ones. and i have a high tolerance for crappy weezer. of course i liked blue and pinkerton best. but i liked maladroit too! and even green! but this is marginally acceptable. Rivers Cuomo is essentially mocking me because i know he can do better and he isn't, on purpose, just to piss me off. I mean, i heard they picked from over 200 songs the ones that go on this album, and that makes me wonder what the rejected songs sound like (really really bad?) and how much time they actually spend on each song.

Make Believe really re-raised the bar, with great tracks like, Perfect Situation(one of my favorites), Hold Me, and We are all on drugs. The second half of the cd is a little weaker, but still catchy. If you dont have this, get it. If you're one of those \\"Hey I only like Pinkerton and the Blue album fans\\", get over it.

If maladroit had 10 songs it would be almost as good as this one but it's still my least favortite weezer record. If u like their music buy Make believe and their other 4 records too. I don't know any musical act that has such a consistent back catalogue. They have made 5 very melodic and strong records in a row so expect their next one to be quality too.

The Green album and Maladroit were lesser albums, but still had at least 3-4 good songs on them. But this album is just terrible. The lyrics are howlingly bad - simple, stupid and childish. The lyrics on the past albums weren't Shakespeare, but at least the music distracted you. This time, the songs are bland, and the melody is lacking.

In my opinion, Make Believe is what the Green Album should have been. The album is full of amazing songs... \\"Perfect Situation\\", \\"Hold Me\\", \\"The Other Way\\"... all the songs are breathtaking! So, please, spend the 13 dollars to buy this album, set aside some time and listen to Make Believe as many times as you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not The Best Weezer Record But Still Good","review":"This album is an improvement over Maladroit, but still isn't the best they have put out.

On the plus side, their sound has really matured. I recommend this record, but mainly to Weezer fans only. I don't think this album will win any fans, but it will satisfy the older ones.The best record to start with is \\"The Blue Album\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet","review":"Weezer's 5th album has proved to be one of their best albums. With great lyrical imagery and the classic Weezer sound it is a piece of work to be reckoned with. Rivers Cuomo and Brian Bell step up to the plate on the guitar work, with suspense building intros and some of the best solos heard from the two. Scott Shriner, the newest member of the band, proves his worth on the bass. Patrick Wilson lends a hand in the rhythm work on drums. All these go together to create a great album for hardcore Weezer fans to those who have never heard of Weezer before. SO GO BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer is back","review":"Well after Buying Make Belive I thought it was all going to be like there hit single Beverly Hills. Just stupid and repetive and it wasn't. It really impressed me. Now I am doing everything that I can to get people to get this album because it is good. Anyone who likes the post-grunge geek rock music style, this album is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Believe","review":"I think that the Green Album and Maladroit are both very underrated by Weezer fans. I usually find myself listening to their debut and/or Pinkerton, but those albums are NOT AS BAD as people make them out to be. Then there's Make Believe...I predict that this album will be one that fans will hold onto long after its radio-play days, much like the Blue Album and Pinkerton. Rivers really tries some new stuff with this one and it pays off. If you've heard \\"Beverly Hills,\\" and thought to yourself, \\"Oh boy, they went back to the style of 'Buddy Holly,'\\" you are in for a suprise. There is much more going on. Pick up this album, listen to it, listen to it again, and then once more. If you still don't like it, you are just in love with a mid-90s memory..."},{"rating":"2","title":"WeeeeeeeeeeeeeeZer","review":"Great CD!I found it very enjoyable and BEverly Hills is only one of many great songs"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend?","review":"I'd really like to get my Weez on but it ain't gonna happen with this new album. Aside from Pinkerton I've been a HUGE fan of Weezer. I was really looking forward to this album and I couldn't be more disapointed. The lyrics are so cheesy they sound like they were written by Rivers 13 year old sister. \\"We're all on drugs\\" sounds like it has to be a joke but it's not funnyl. Beverly Hills is the strongest track on this CD. I'm really a little confused as to why they put this out. Maybe this cheese is good for your average 13 year old but I'm the same age as the guys in the band and I wish I'd downloaded it for free instead of wasting my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"lets make believe this cd didn't suck","review":"*sigh* i knew it was coming when i heard beverly hills for the first time and good god no, not the last, i heard that same song every single time i stepped into my car!!!! every time! and i needed to change the radio station every time it came on and yes, half way thru the first time hearing it i was sick of it! it is so phony so non musical it really does not live up to the wonderful and creative work that weezer has been producing for their last 4 cds. although every other song completely sucked perfect situation was ok but it would have been better if they stuck it on one of their previous cds. but make believe really doesn't cut it. it really is not at all good and i LOVED every other weezer album. really weezer - step up to the plate!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sean, Honolulu","review":"I don't see how anyone could give this album five stars. Much less anything over 2. If you want, I can go write the same album or better in about a week. It is that cookie cutter and unoriginal. The songs are boring, the lyrics are simply idiotic and sophomoric, and it's overall just garbage. I am a diehard Weezer fan of yore (Before the Green Album era downfall) and can't believe how much they have begun to suck. How anyone could even begin to compare this to Pinkerton or the Blue Album is beyond me. It's awful awful unoriginal music people. Don't listen to it. Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, not horrible.","review":"Personally, when I look at a band that has multiple albums, I expect to see some variation and some evolution. This album is exactly the opposite of evolution. It's the same as maladroit or green. Not as 'poppy' as green. However, there is nothing special about this. The lyrics are pathetic for a 30 year old. Musically, the full disc is the exact same monotonous music. Basically, if you listened to green or maladroit, you are getting more of the same with this album. There has been no evolution in this band and that is depressing. If this album wasn't their fifth, I might give it a better score. However, considering that this is their fifth album and that the band has neglected to show any change or evolution or progression, I have to give this a generous 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"To sum up something interesting I heard once...","review":"...someone said \\"I can't stand listening to Pinkerton or any of Weezer's albums anymore; Make Believe killed all Weezer for me :(\\"So, yeah, Weezer has pretty much lost all \\"edge\\" and made a very annoying pop album. If you are new to listening to Weezer, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM, get the Blue Album, Green Album, or Maladroit instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer Sold Out With This Album","review":"I bought this album, like many people this year who were looking for decent music in todays bad times for rock, along with Foo Fighters 'In Your Honor' and Beck's 'Guero'. Of the 3 CD's I purhcased that day, this is by far my least favorite. Very dissapointing. I am a fan of Weezer's old stuff, and the single \\"Beverley Hills\\" was good, which made me think the album would be, but guess what? The album turned out to be a boring, sophmoric emo album, something I would never buy if I had not had previous respect for this band. I like \\"Beverley Hills\\", \\"This Is Such A Pity\\", and \\"We Are All On Drugs\\" (\\"Your My Best Friend\\", for some reason, has also started to grow on me). Other than the aforementioned songs this album is sophmoric emo crap. I believe I will sell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make Belive... that this is a good album...","review":"Granted, Blue Album, Pinkerton, Green Album (although a little too poppy and generic), and most of Maladroit are some of my favorite, and the best albums ever made, however Make Believe fails to strike a chord in my heart. Basically this album's songs just don't match up to the old ones and are maybe, so to speak, too crooneresque? Weezer needs the heavy guitar (Tired of Sex) to really come out, not speaking the same cliche phrase over and over again (Beverly Hills, the epitome of horrible).Since it's Weezer, I cannot give them 1 star, they're just too amazing. I will definitly see the Make Belive tour, just to hear the old stuff, however I do not recommend Make Believe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer NOOOOO!!!","review":"Every song on this album follows a formula: soft verse followed by a slow and sappy chorus. It sounds distinctly Weezer, but this time it isn't very good. You can see everything coming from a mile away.. I pretty much knew what \\"Hold Me\\" sounded like within the first 30 seconds. They also have the obligatory slow ballad closer \\"Dece\\".. er, \\"Only in Dr\\".. sorry, \\"Haunt You Every Day\\".There are three good songs on here: \\"Beverly Hills\\" is classic Weezer in the vein of \\"El Scorcho\\", \\"Peace\\" has some great little guitar melodies, and \\"Freak Me Out\\" is a really amusing tune with a riff similar to the \\"Sweater Song\\". That's about it.I was really disappointed with this one. It sounds like they had a bunch of leftover ballads from their other albums and slapped them all on here. Has Weezer lost it? Say it Aint So!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer still rocks","review":"Weezer decides to focus more on sincerity than humor this time around. You do still get tongue-in-cheek songs such as 'Beverly Hills' and 'We Are All on Drugs', but you also get more heartfelt and personal tunes like 'Hold Me,' My Best Friend,' and 'The Damage in Your Heart.' Weezer still rocks, and chalk one up in the hit column for producer Rick Ruben (he's been so fickle recently)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album... an individual album","review":"I think that this album has a lot of potential to becoming one of weezers better albums. I do not like it how many people desperately cling on to the hopes of another blue or pinkerton... as with any band, they are making different sounds and noises now. It is merely time to focus on these new noises. That said, there are several things i like about this album. It has somewhat of a \\"back to the 80s\\" theme to it on some songs, with some power pop piano riffs in the back. One thing i did not like about the album was We Are All on Drugs and Beverely Hills strange displacement to the rest of the album. Overall however, i liked it quite a bit, and would definetely reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad will not work","review":"the data said it will work on windows; none specific, so I thought it would work on windows 7...it will not.

However, despite the interesting storyline, the writing was laughably bad. Stilted dialogue and uninteresting paragraphs on things that have nothing to do with the story abound! Seriously, who cares about the churning of the butter? And who talks like these people? Nobody I know, that's for sure. I will give the author two stars for research, but that's about as courteous I can be, especially considering the writing was very cringe-worthy in more than one place. I don't have the book handy right now, but there was a part where a character said, \\"Come hear\\" instead of \\"Come here\\" as if should have been. After reading that, I failed to take this author seriously at all, but again, the premise was nice. It just needed some editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful boy","review":"Over all this book is charming. The pen drawings really make the book. Rupert (aka Sprout) looks exactly like my son.

You'd think they'd do the interface in C++ if they're such wizards.Add to that they (obviously) do not take into account any of the advances in either the language, operating systems or the hardware over the last 5+ years and you've got a fairly useles (for learning, anyhow) product.Keep away unless you really want to throw money away (might I suggest a worthy charity instead?), or just want it for historical reasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wetin 40-0145 Sportsman Steel Grille Guard","review":"The grille guard is solid and looks awesome on my durango.

But in Ms. Pac-Man, all those problems were eliminated, the ghosts have a very minor flickering but it won't pose any problem whatsoever. This is the Pac-Man game gamers have been waiting for to arrive on home consoles. The graphics are really good, the layout of the level changes after each level, the music at the beginning is similiar (yet a bit more pixelated) to the arcade version, and the game is actually playable. I would definitely rank Pac-Man for ATari 2600 one out of five stars, but Ms. Pac-Man is completely playable and very fun. Obviously nowhere near as good as the arcade version, but it was the best option gamers had because most gamers couldn't afford to buy a big arcade machine.

And you'll feel her panting as she pedals up a steep hill. By the time you finish you'll know Chiang and you'll be conversant on life in Cuba. One can only hope the author has more trips and experiences in her fertile mind that she eventually shares them with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel book","review":"An excellent book and very observant of the 'small things' that Lynette sees as she cycles around this marvellously eccentric and somewhat surreal island.

Very reminiscent of my own bike-borne tour too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best travel memoirs I've read","review":"I read travel memoirs and guidebooks as avidly as I read novels, and I have to say that The Handsomest Man in Cuba is one of the best travel memoirs I've read. I found the book at a bookstore in Kathmandu after trekking in Nepal, and reading it on the flight home to San Francisco almost made me want to divert the plane to Mexico so I could arrange a little jaunt to Cuba! Lynette paints a vivid, gorgeous picture of a country I've wanted to visit for years...although she certainly doesn't sugarcoat things. I felt as if I was there biking alongside her (and I can completely relate to her lack of sense of direction :). Also, Lynette is just a very good writer; unfortunately, not all authors of travel memoirs can write particularly well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best travel book yet","review":"I have to agree with Peter Sutherland's review of \\"The Handsomest Man in Cuba.\\" I could not put Ms. Chiang's book down. I have read Weir, Mayes, Kurmaskie and many others; however, she has written the best travel book I have read. My only regret is that I reached the end of the book.It is amazing how a Ms. Chiang can travel this world on a shoestring budget and seem to be able to befriend almost everyone on the trip.Ms. Chiang's book presents a non-political view of a country and it's people in an interesting and humorous manner. I was able to see the people and places she wrote about--not just read the words on the page. She is an extremely gifted writer. I just hope she writes about more of her travels so I can live vicariously through her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, good for price.","review":"Not very impressed with these shoes, not nearly as much as other Nunn Bush products. I found them quite stiff out of the box, and the leather too firm. After several months of occaisional wear they had not loosened up, rather, the leather had developed uncomfortable and unsightly creases. Granted, these are inexpensive shoes, and I bought them for rainy days when I did not want to wear my more expensive black dress shoes.I still have them, wear them occaisionally when the weather is bad, but will be looking for another foul-weather pinch-hitter when these either wear out or I have some money to spend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of shoes","review":"I bought a pair of these at Foley's (now Macy's) in Houston about 2 years ago. I loved these shoes so much, I went to buy another one; however, as Macy's bought out Foley's (a Mays company store), they took it off the shelf. A few searches online via Google and Amazon.com had them. I ordered it as soon as I saw it. It arrived two days later at my door and began to wear it. Like any other new shoes, you will get blisters, so don't forget to double up on your socks for the weeks. After that, it's straight coasting. They're really comfortable and the leather is great. The sole is also tough. On my first pair, the soles went out on me but that's because I walked on gravel and stones for a whole week everyday. The stones and gravel eventually softened it but for street walking and carpet, it's great because you don't slip, or slide and stick on carpet. So, it's really ideal. Also, it's great for dancing :)I hope this review helps.

Of course, I lost them over time and so many moves. The highlight for me was the luminous performance of No.102. Fortunately, several year ago I was able to add these three CDs to my library. Aural memory is more a matter of remembered impressions than sharp details, but the CDs seem to me every bit as fine as the Vanguard LPs back in the day.Those Vanguard vinyls were a bargain back then.

Does Devereux not want to be a romance novelist anymore- she has taken out all romance. All that is here is a high school version of a John Grisham novel.. but worse. I miss my Devereaux of old where there were these great characters that you fell in love with that inturn fell in love with each other. There used to be good dialogue that made you smile, laugh out loud or even made you tear up. It is hard to believe the author who wrote Rememberance would put her name on a book so very badly written an call it a love story.Very badly done Deveraux.. very badly done.Look for her earlier works.. if this is any indication of her future writng there are all going to be worth missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Impression","review":"I am usually a great fan of Jude Deveraux's novels, but this one was a major disappointment. It is a mystery, and I don't think mystery writing is Ms. Deveraux's forte. Too many loose ends, criminals that appeared out of nowhere, and unsatisfactory resolutions for a couple of the main characters made this book a most unsatisfying read. I think Ms. Deveraux is ordinarily a wonderful author, but I suggest she stick with historical or modern romance, straight up or with a little occult tossed in. This book was in the vein of her previous novel \\"High Tide\\", which was also terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hard time staying focused","review":"Overall,I thought the premise of the story showed promise. What I found, after forcing my way through reading, was that the plot is not up to Jude's normal standards. The theme seems to drag and it's hard to stay intereseted when the plot changes so very much and so drastically every five pages. I also found he lack of romance a bit disappointing. It really didn't feel like there was enough of the charecters interactions to understand them. It's definitely not her useual style. Her romance writing style is what I like so much about herbooks, and I saw none of it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"TERRIFIC !!!!!","review":"A page turner, GREAT story with twists and turns, wonderful characters.

She used to write wonderful stories of romance, but is now venturing into the paranormal, and now into romantic suspense. She should go back to what she does better....think Knight in Shining Armor, and Remembrance.I didn't even finish the book, because I literally didn't care what happened to the characters, so I can't tell you plot details.This wouldn't be bad as a book to read at the beach, because you wouldn't care if you dropped it in the ocean.

Big mistake. While it does have a nice element of office humor, it's a one note plot, taking place almost entirely as a few people run between cubicles away from very slow moving zombies. Perhaps the writers could have mixed things up a bit by having them trapped in an elevator or crawling through ventilation. But then again, that might have cost more than the budget allowed. Perhaps the biggest sin is supposedly \\"eaten\\" people showed up later as zombies without an ounce of blood on their clothes. In fact, i'm not sure i saw any blood at all (or bite marks), which makes this a toothless zombie movie.

Especially when there exists books out there, self published, like David Robbins \\"Himalayan Odyssey\\" that capture true insight into the Tibetan culture over a long, rigourous time and method. Instead, we're once again merely given more of the same pretty landscapes and fuzzy warm children that any passing tourist with a good working knowledge of their camera could do. Art is (was?) a wonderful person, I'm sure, though a mediocre photographer at best. Check out David's book for the real deal.

This movie managed to be utterly boring. There is no story line, no climax, you learn nothing about the Yom Kippur war, its context or anything relating to it, and not really anything about the characters either. The shots are endless, especially of the same tracks and the same tanks again and again and the same injured soldiers. The only thing I learned was that a lot of stretchers were used during the war. The content of this movie was just about enough for a short film, especially if you take out the long sex scenes in the beginning and end, which were apparently only there to add time and to maybe wake you up at the end. Somehow Gitai seems to have thought an art movie means an utterly pretentious, boring movie. What an utter disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"Poor writing and awful direction. The beginning of the movie is unrealistic and portend to what follows. The movie is plagued with unnecessary shots. This is your typical Amos Gitai movie. He tries to be artsy about serious topics and ends up making a boring movie. The type of director that gets money from friends in the government to make pseudo intellectual movies. How can you make a movie about Yom Kippur war and flunk it? You get the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst war movies of all times","review":"This movies is lacking any form of plot or story line, it is also stretched unnecessarily. Gitai obviously created this movie for propaganda purposes. Basically the same scenes appear over an over again just in different settings. I had expect, being a veteran of that war, that he would be able to translate the pain and suffering of the reservists into the concept of the movie but the failed terribly.The fact that amazed me the most is the lack detail. The injured soldiers mostly are completely unresponsive if they are not vital to the hardly existing story and for some reason none of them (the ones in the field) have any physical injuries visible.Probably the only more disappointing aspect of this movie, aside from the directing, is the acting of the main characters. Not convincing and often very amateurish.Overall, if this movie is not 99 cents, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"How is it possible to make a war movie boring? especially one about as dramatic of an event as the 1973 October War? well these folks managed to do it. After what seemed like a promising start showing a very huiman element and realistic experience - traffic jams etc - it never built up or got unstuck from that sense of smallness and triviality. It was a disappointing movie and I had difficulty finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This film is so powerful that you feel it","review":"Not recommended for those who are used to fast moving action films. Kippur is slow moving and the moments of utter silence create a certain unease at the beginning, but little by little, one is totally taken into the movie. The rythm of the movie gives the viewer the time to feel the horror of war, although no war scenes appear. It pitcures normal people with normal concerns in the midst of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music","review":"I ordered this CD shortly after I heard an interview with the Bergmans on NPR.

Mack and Bailey's relationship should have been developed more. Bailey became too enmeshed with her \\"son\\" too quickly. She also \\"found\\" him too quickly and easily.

It is a story of true love under the most tragic of circumstances. Bravery in the face of death, and how love anchors all and gives meaning to life. The book is a microcosm of the titanic battle that the gay community is so courageously waging against the modern day scourge of AIDS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devastating, beautiful and true","review":"'Borrowed Time' is the most unpretentious, cliche free account of love I've read. So much of it's power lies in what Paul does not say about his lover: describing him most often as his most precious 'friend' he asks the reader to understand, to implicitly know the strength of his passion. The simple assumption that readers across cities, countries, cultures will understand his emotions is what gives the story so much beauty. I fell in love with both Paul and Roger, or more specifically, the strength of what they had together.The battle against AIDS and discrimination faced by both men made me bawl, and I hope this book is read by people working through their prejudices and moral judgements about the both the illness and its prevalence in the gay community at the time the events occurred. Surely Paul and Roger's love can only be seen as something beautiful that graced the earth, even briefly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monette's work is the finest writing on AIDS and loving relationships","review":"When I am lost, or in the middle of a stretch of unknowing, I pick up Paul's work and always find my way to my heart and calming.

I only wish there was some way a new edition could be produced to take into account any further developoments in the understanding of plate tectonics, the effects of warming and sprawl, etc., that would be relevant. But it is an extraordinary book and not out of date in any important way with what it says, despite being forty years old. Anyone with an appreciation of the North American forest MUST read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many rules!","review":"If you want to use this book you need to read it before you actually get pregnant. I am at the end of my second trimester and all of the rules in this book are overwhelming. I recommend the Husband-coached childbirth: The Bradley Method. I spoke with my midwife about this book,the gentle birth method, she pretty much told me to get rid of it. The only things I liked in the book were the massage methods and yoga positions. So, I give it one star for each of those things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"We cannot imagine why anyone would give this movie 5 stars. It was disjointed, poorly acted, and kind of sick. Having never read Dante's Inferno, maybe we just didn't get the symbolism. It is a really sad story that was not that well told.

We decided to watch it because it got high ratings on Amazon and Rotten Tomatoes. However, the entire movie is grossly cliché, with a terrible screenplay, and poorly acted and directed. Tilda Swinton, who is a very talented actress, gives as good as a performance as she can give, considering the poor script and horrible direction. The movie attempts to create psychologically thrilling scenes, but what it really amounts to is pulling some ideas from a psychology case study and piecing them together to make a movie. For instance, Kevin is not a very believable character. He does things and the viewer is left with no idea why other than some text book snippets thrown into the movie at random. The whole movie is disjointed (we couldn't even understand most of what was happening until at least 40 minutes in) in the director's lame attempt to be \\"artistic.\\" Not worth the time... certainly not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"World's Worst Movie","review":"By far the weirdest movie I have ever watched.

Here is a partial list of what I found too preposterous:a. That this woman would be with this man, give up her lifestyle to become a suburbanite.b. That this woman didn't tell her husband what the son was doing. Like not telling her husband about what she found in the kitchen sink.c. That she never sought professional help for Kevin--or herself.d. That townspeople would treat her the way they did, or that she'd stay in the same town.e. The bows n arrows massacre??? Puh-leeze.The one thing I found positive about the film was the depiction of this woman's repugnance for her baby: if you know anything about infant development, you'll know that a loveless mother can indeed spawn a psychopath like Kevin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-made, but Why made?","review":"This is one of those movies that seemed to me to have been made only to give actors a chance to act. Yes, the performances were great, but I watch movies to be entertained (or made to exercise my brain) by a story, not to marvel at the performances. There was little plot to this movie, and what there was of it was deeply disturbing without any redeeming resolution or moral to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal, SIlly, Shallow","review":"Is this a serious film about nihilistic teens who kill, about misogyny, about parenthood, about sadism ... about anything real? No. It's a silly contrived story with no depth.Is it at least worth seeing for the performances? No. I like Tilda Swinton and I like Ezra Miller, but they're not featured well here in these silly shallow parts. The best acting here is actually done by the young kid playing the evil boy at ages 6 - 8. He's just a kid; he's not SUPPOSED to be subtle, unless anyone told him to be, so he has an excuse.So, is it at least entertaining in some way? Like, say, \\"Orphan\\" which is also unrealistic but which is a pretty good suspense film? No.I could tell this film was awful pretty early on.

This doesn't exactly answer these questions but it does give some insight to the pondering question: are some people born evil or is it developed through how they are raised (or lack thereof)? Swinton is amazing of course, never doubted she would be. There are unsanswered questions which I wish were answered, which I won't mention because of spoilers. However, in a situation like this, there are SO MANY unanswered questions it's almost fitting. An interesting look into a psychological look at \\"troubled\\" kids and their parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Waste of Celluloid","review":"Not since \\"Funny Games\\" have a seen a film so devoid of meaning. Perhaps, like earthquakes, these things must come along at regular intervals. Like an itch you can't scratch, Kevin is out of reach of the viewer - and the throttling he deserves cannot be delivered. Perhaps this is why the film appeals to some - a celebration of impotence or some other Freudian concept. As for me, the one positive in it was that I saw it for free. Of course, like \\"Funny Games\\", after it was over, I felt the filmmaker owed me for my time. Whatever else you can say about the film, it makes porn seem absolutely artistic by comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISTURBING AND UNPLEASANT","review":"I finally watched this movie because I think that Tilda is an amazing actress. However, this movie doesn't do her justice. She is the only thing good about the movie, but it's too painful too watch. In the movie, her son is a true psychopath who seems to have been born with the intent to destroy his mother; he does that and so much more.

By definition, her story plays out in her thoughts and memories, expressed by the book's author in really elegant, often-convoluted language. Her method of writing IS her character. The movie plucks events from the book without being able to show the thoughts and perceptions that caused them, so we never get a solid understanding of who these people are, and how complex they are. The book is terrific. Nothing wrong with the acting; Tilda Swinton and the actors who play her son do as good a job as they can with what they are given."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"We Need To Talk About Kevin\\" is quietly horrifying","review":"A dark, creeping story that left me screaming on the inside while mutely watching Tilda Swinton (the world's best actress,) play the world's most unfortunate mother.Kevin is \\"The Bad Seed\\" redux.Outstanding acting by entire cast; beautiful photography; surreal telling of a macabre tale.This one stayed with me for some time after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"Great psychological movie.

A heart-throbish looking teenager who prances around in shirts 3 sizes too small with a \\"too cool for the room\\" delivery is not what usually comes to mind. Did his parents never buy him any shirts after the age of 5 and that's why he snapped? I know that in movies you have to suspend the expectation of realism sometimes.

Not a family movie, at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow as molasses","review":"While the topic seemed intriguing and the actors are well-known and accomplished, the pace of this movie is not only painfully slow, but appears to have nowhere to go. Over an hour into the film and the character flaws revealed in the first 15 minutes are still in evidence without any further development. And the story line is also painfully predictable. Without spoiling the outcome for others, the director pretty much clubs you over the head with where the story will go early on so there is no need to watch the whole movie. And the complete lack of action/interest/motivation from either of the parent characters is totally unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Need To Talk About How BAD This Movie Is !","review":"Please do NOT waste your time or money on this movie. Despite a laudable performance by Swinton, the movie is slow, monotonous, tiresome, devoid of suspense or dramatic tension and a GREAT disappointment vis-a-vis recommendations on the jacket-cover or other Amazon customers. At the end of this movie, I actually apologized to my wife, my older kids, AND MY TWO DOGS for wasting their time. It was clear that the movie's producer/directors did not know what to do with the movie, how to narrow it's focus, and how to decide whether it was a slow social commentary or a horror film or a failed suspense film. It failed to accomplish success within any genre, unfortunately. DO NOT PURCHASE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We Need to Talk About Kevin","review":"Wanted to like it. Hated it!

Plus, unless you're a complete imbecile you can see the ending less than halfway into the film. It's been said that movies use a frequent flashback format to improve a bland script. This film certainly supports that theory. Oh and Acadamy Award nomination? Look at the cover of the film, that's the expression on Tilda Swinton's face for 113 minutes. Three words to describe this film:Simple. Boring. Nauseating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Just because a film is an Art House film, it does not have to be bad. But this one is bad.

It also helps if you are fascinated with red (no, not from bloodshed, just....red.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching Stupor and Misery make Me Miserable.

We Need to Talk About Kevin is an insightful look into how young murderers are born. The psychological undertone of how his mother influenced him from infancy is not often seen in movies, which is why this movie was so great. There are not many movies like this one, and like others before who have braced the deviant side of movies, it has gotten some baleful reviews, but the acting was on point, the subject matter extremely interesting, and the way it goes back in time from age to age is interesting, making small connections. Those who were dissatisfied with the time period changes are obviosly used to a simpler movie with a cliche story line. This movie is worth the watch, and the book is now a must-read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Storytelling","review":"Within three days of seeing this film for the first time, I watched it twice more. It captivated me that much. The subject matter is heavy but the story is not a parable; it does a fantastic job of not dictating a lesson learned or creating archtypes of heroes and villains. The story is presented nonlinearly but not in a gimmicky way, focusing on five phases of the protagonist, Eva's (Tilda Swinton) life. It abandons the typical escalating-events-that-crescendo-into-a-specific-climax type storytelling; one that traditionally would spoil the movie after the first viewing or reading about the ending. The quality of this movie doesn't rely on the nature of its subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tilda Swinton is amazing as usual!","review":"I liked this movie, but at times it was hard to watch. The characters have so much pain they are trying to figure out what to do with. Tilda's character is so torn between wanting to help her son and wanting to make sure he doesn't hurt anyone. She plays the part of a mother in such agony so well that it makes you agonize right along with her.This is not a light hearted movie, but the acting is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Actors played as best they could but the plot was all over the board - IMO it was a wasted evening!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Roger Ebert's review is on-point -- completely confused timeline, NO action, more of a collage than a movie.

The organization into daily lessons and summaries is irritating and the lessons have left me with only a hazy idea of what Interdev can do. Practical examples and useful code are sorely lacking.

It's big on overview and throwing tons of buzz words aroundbut doesn't actuallly teach much. The author spends incredable amounts of time introducing and summarzing each chapter but since there's nothing worth reading in the chapter, what's the point. Looking at the back of the book it has a scale indicating who the book it aimed at. It runs the gambit from novice to sub-expert and I'd guess this would be a good book for a manager to read so that he can know all the latest buzz words and some high level concepts but doesn't actually have to work with Visual Interdev. Also, the material on VB Script and ASP is very rudimentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor content, pooly written.","review":"The author spends more time previewing and reviewing each chapter than he does informing you about Interdev.This book will not teach you much about Interdev or Active Server Pages which it also briefly covers"},{"rating":"1","title":"An all-time low","review":"This book was so pathetic - many of the examples simply don't work.

Not that hard, I would imagine. Just design a round cover that fits over most plates and bowls. It seems pretty straight forward.Progressive manages to botch the job by making a grip that depresses into the top of the cover, rather than extending over the top. Because the cover is so shallow, this little depression dunks itself into the food about 80% of the time, sometimes smooshing the food and always making a mess to clean up afterwards.This cover gets the job done and saves me money on saran wrap, but I can't help but feel that the designers worked overtime to build a flaw into a fairly foolproof concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"Nice idea, but too small.

Or actions and reactions.If your looking for help on how to inspirer and maintain a long term relationship, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple stand to avoid messes","review":"When a larger table isn't available, this little stand works great. The design is simple and the funtion is useful. I've stacked 3 12\\" ovens on this thing without any problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very awkward.","review":"I bought this for my mother, who is in her 80's and has knee problems. Unfortunately, it is too awkward to be of much use and overpriced for what it is. She can't use it on a sofa or recliner, where the real knee problems crop up. It's only functional on a hard chair. But getting up from a hard chair isn't the issue. It also slips around so it's hard to get it set just right. If you set the spring too low, it doesn't help you. But if you set it a tad too high, it will cause a loss of balance getting up (and may cause a fall)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter of joy","review":"It has a little bit of everything romance, suspense and trials.

This is a good book for any one to read if they enjoy a good story. I especially enjoyed the thoughts and emotions of the heroine in her journey. Something I could relate to even in modern times. You just don't always know where God is taking your life or why He seems to send you down dead ends. It was encouraging to trust God but that doesn't mean you will understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I could not put this book down.

While somewhat skeptical, I decided to give it a try due to the high ratings accumulated thus far. This book is excellent! The writer does a fantastic job depicting the spirit of the era and helps you relate to each character on a personal level. I found the book spiritually focused, endearing, and warm to the heart. I recommend this book to any lady looking for a lovely story of a man and woman both on the path of seeking God's purpose in their life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank heavens this was a free book","review":"I hate to say anything so negative about any faith-based book. However, like a few reviewers already mentioned, this plot was so thin, so obvious, I didn't get past the first chapter. Also - the point of view (POV) switched mid-paragraph and at times, every other sentence which is unusual, and often the sign of an amateur writer.I'm sure the message is lovely, however, this is on a reading level for a young audience (IMHO). I can tell you exactly where the story is going without having finished the first chapter. In addition, I felt the characters to be one dimensional and for me, at least if the characters are strong, I don't care that I can predict the outcome of the story. Sadly, thin plot and thin characters made me delete this one from my Kindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was free","review":"This was one of the worst book I have ever read. Abby was very judgmental and thought she was always right. I felt she tried to force her beliefs on people. I have enjoyed faith books before but like someone else said it felt like a sermon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughter if Joy","review":"it did not load on my reader, tried many time, read first page, on the second pager, on an error message, to close and retry again..... gave up and deleted book from ereader..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"This book was just boring, like so many other christian books I've read. I find it hard to believe that anyone actually thinks talks or acts like that. It's not believable. There wasn't much of a plot. I found myself skimming through quite a few times. I kept reading just because I don't like to leave a book unfinished. I'm not trying to slam christian books. I'm a christian and I would like to see more books out there that are actually fit for innocent eyes. This book was just bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"It was a good story if you are looking for a religious romance. I won't be reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean but good reading","review":"I enjoyed this book!

Any parent can read this in front of their teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful story, rich characters!","review":"This is book is excellent. The characters are complex and believable. The basic storyline may have been spun hundreds of times but this by far outshines all the ones I've read, and I've read a lot. When you get to a book like this you realize this is \\"Fine dining\\"! Ms Morgan obviously incorporated and instilled her own suffering into a beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Realistic, Needed in Inspritaional Fiction","review":"I haven't read any of Kathleen Morgan's previous books, but she has brought inspirational fiction a gift. The reference to intimacy (physical, emotional and spiritual) is realistic and powerful, although not graphic. Imagination has it's own rewards. The story line is great! The characters seem alive! Keep writing inspirational fiction, Kathleen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian Fiction???","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed by this book! Yes, it is religious if by that you mean the author talks about going to church and talks generally about God. But the morals are totally unbiblical! The main character falls in love with a proclaimed atheist who visits the whorehouse. All through the book you hear her Christian friend encouraging her to marry the guy. The message I got out of the book is this: if it's love it can't be wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this.....","review":"I read this story based on the reviews and I wanted to like the story.

I was worried that it would be too \\"preachy\\" but it wasn't. It made me cry on multiple levels- for the characters and myself. The reader can truly appreciate the struggles that the characters face as similar struggles in our own lives. I will gladly read more of this series. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like at all","review":"I read christian fiction all the time, but I hated this book! The main character knows not to be equally unyoked with her love interest, but it doesn't stop her from accepting his marriage proposal. I felt like while the main character had strong faith, the author was sending mixed messages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner.","review":"Nothing exciting to write home about in this book. The story has been done before so there was no suspense. In fact, throughout the book I kept getting the feeling I'd read this book before. I love books set in that time period though, so finished it even though I wanted to quit half way through. The characters were boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter of Joy","review":"This was an inspirational book with many twists and turns.

Wish I could be as the women in these books!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtle as a Neon Sign","review":"I don't think Kathleen Morgan gave her readers credit for much intelligence at all. We weren't allowed to draw any conclusions, but were beat over the head with everything. Including the heavy-handed religious messages. She even had to add an epilogue with the main character writing to a friend about how she had learned and changed over the course of the book. Uhh...we got it already. Several times.I agree with other reviewers that sometimes characters did things quite out of character. I cringed when (brave, strong, manly) Connor sent his farmhands into the burning building to rescue Abby's stuff, instead of going in himself. And poor Beth just disappeared from the story as soon as she abruptly stopped resisting Abbey.Many of the plot elements seemed contrived.And it was very preachy.The premise was interesting, and some of the scenes were quite good. I like the historical details.If you want more subtle Christian historical frontier reading, I'd recommend Janette Oke."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck . . . religious fiction should not be this crappy","review":"absolutely horrible . . . I have truly enjoyed some religious romances that provided unique, intricate characters whom the reader loved, grieved with and routed for . . . this tale however was not one of them. The only redeeming factor was that the text was free. The characters were shallow and the text could have stood alone as a christian treatise concerning Christ and God . . . the author did not provide the reader with an incentive to understand or commiserate with her characters - the prose was peppered with trite modern/historical slang . . . 'hill of beans' is what stuck with me the most and I associate such terms with '50-'60's old west films . . .Utter Crap! Please don't waste the freebie . . . Buy some Jeanette Oke if you're looking for religious/historical/romantic fiction!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit over the top.","review":"I was put off by the religous references, especially at the start of the book.

I loved seeing the main characters faith in good tested throughout the book. Each time a new problem arouse she trusted her God and truly lived by the saying \\"give it to God.\\" There was never a dull point in the story and it can truly be enjoyed by Christians and non Christians alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iffy","review":"This book made me feel uncomfortable. The way the love was being described from a far (third person) made the whole interaction between Connor and Abby just awkward. I couldn't really get into it. It felt flat and redundant. The couple would make progress and then regress just as quickly when some unexpected thing was thrown at them. Easy read though. Not a favorite or a life changer to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read","review":"Good inspirational book.

Kindle download","review":"I'm an avid reader and this writer is NOT comparable to Jan Karon, Lavryle Spencer, or any others that I currently read. I found her writing to be \\"not believable\\", conversations between characters over done (no one talks like that). During the same day I was listening to an audio book while working around the house..by Lavryle Spencer (That Camden Summer) and the difference in their writing abilities \\"BLARED\\" out at me. I was hoping I had found another writer/author who I would enjoy, but I'm sorry to say, it's not Kathleen Morgan. Her story line was very similar to \\"Letters of a Homesteader Woman\\" which is a non-fiction book,(WONDERFUL!!)but Ms. Morgan's content came up short of an interesting, believable book. Maeve Binchy, Rosamunde Pilcher, Anne Rivers Siddons, Adriana Trigaini, and so many more are great, NOT in the same league with this writer. Since the e-book was FREE, at least I didn't overpay for it. I will delete it from my Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good readable story","review":"The storyline is nothing new: The two main characters being in love, the male difficult and inaccessable, countless ups and downs in the relationship and one misunderstanding every ten pages.

The plot was disturbing and complicated. The book was worse than a never-ending Sunday sermon. This was just plain in-your-face proselytizing, the kind that makes your skin crawl because what is being said is, \\"If you don't accept Lord Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior, you will go straight down to the fiery pits of Hell.\\"I only really purchased it because the Kindle version is free. Is it any wonder it's free? It is a bunch of Christian Propaganda labeled as Historical-Fiction/Romance. Be warned readers, if you don't like Mormon's showing up on your doorstep and asking you if you have found Jesus Christ then you should not even remotely think of getting this book. Yes, even if it's free.People who rated this book more than one star, I wonder what they have been smoking, they probably shouldn't take it on a plane."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I have enjoyed this series of books by Kathleen Morgan, have read the first three, can't wait to read the last of the series number 4.

I loved the storyline and the characters are very believeable. Best of all, I loved the way this book encouraged me to stay true to God's plan for my life. Abby faced many difficult situations yet she remained true to her Heavenly Father first, knowing He would work it all out for her. I was also touched by the author's own story of loss (which she mentions at the start of the book).

She goes to the general store and gives the proprietor her shopping list: 5 pounds of flour, 2 pounds of sugar, a tin of baking powder, a half pound of salt.The proprietor says, \\"Oh, you must be planning to do a lot of Christmas baking\\". Yes. So she goes home and \\"spends several hours\\" and bakes five batches of cookies, a fruitcake, and 3 pies.

Bringing God into what is little more than an overly-long, rambling Harlequin romance-type novel seems, to me, to be somewhat sacrilegious. This is not a true Christian romance story IMHO.Sorry to be so nit-picky, but a couple of glaring factual errors jumped out while reading. First, biscuits are not made from \\"batter\\" that is ladled into a pan, but dough that is rolled out. Second, I do not believe flour was sold in 5-lb. packages. With almost daily baking of bread loaves, biscuits and flapjacks, along with her seasonal Christmas cookie-baking, she would more likely have needed a 50-lb. sack of flour.

I was surprised to see that it actually is copyrighted a year earlier, so it must represent the quality work that gave the producers the license to turn out the later schlock. Not that this is of high quality; the cartoons are still incomprehensible, and the Henry character is still annoying rather than hilarious. But the nature segments were longer, more educational, and also of a high quality, although the subject of insects may have had something to do with it. The storyline between Henry and the narrator is diminished, and rightfully so. This is still far from a quality show though, with lame jokes and an insensitivity to footage that might be scary to toddlers (such as a seemingly giant tarantula squeezing into Henry's house, with the explanation that mini beasts love to live in our homes)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"Unless I was shipped dead batteries, these things give out next to no light.

I upgraded my software to SP2, but the maps have major issues. Finding addresses that are located on routes is almost impossible. The problem is that most stores/shopping centers have a route address. There is no option of avoiding a specific road or highway. The worst part (possibly fixed now) is that this unit will tell me to do two u-turns one right after the other for no apparent reason. It made me do two u-turns while going from NYC to Boston on 95... I like the hardware, and if I could get it to work with other software - I would be fine with it.

Since this thoroughfare MUST be taken in order to get to my neighborhood, anyone using Navman's routing would never get there.I also noticed that the Navman routing seems to avoid highways when they are both the fastest and shortest way to get there. I inputted a local airport as my destination from my point of departure, and Navman on either \\"quickest\\" or \\"shortest\\" settings, always maps through a maze of local streets, when anyone would know the quickest route is a particular local highway.I have used Hertz Neverlost GPS when I have rented cars, and I never had this problem with whatever mapping system they use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to make use of an older iPaq","review":"I had shelved my iPaq since buying a Smartphone.

I strictly followed their instructions and sat happily outside for about 45 mins. as the Navman waited for GPS, which of course never happened. So I called Navman Support and they e-mailed a small program to me that was suppose to resolve the problem. Question number 1, why is there a separate fix program available - why not fix the problem within the installation software? Anyway...I installed the fix and received a communications error. After another call to Navman, they determine the unit was defective. Having it in my possession for all of 24 hours and the best Navman could offer was a RMA # and a promise to repair the defective unit. I thought they might just send me a new one while I shipped the defective one back to them. No such luck. So I don't trust Navman reliability, support, or service.

Also, the directions don't tell what side of the street the destination address is on! I'm switching to CoPilot.

I would echo the positive review previous stated and recommend this disc to the lover of Baroque music - even those who are weary of yet another concerto. Everything about it is superb - the unique compositions, the playing of Elizabeth Wallfish and team and the Hyperion sound quality. It is a disc that is easy and enjoyable to hear often.

It is a poorly made paperback, and the publisher has not reproduced any of the original photographs with the one exception being the frontis, which in my copy looks like a cheesy Xerox. This book is still available in the 1920's Blue Ribbon reprint, in hardback with photos for less than this \\"new\\" paperback. I am VERY dissapointed with this edition.

The gung-ho climbing aesthetic is also questionable, given the authors' own backgrounds.

Spread over two CD's as opposed to the flabby 'Elements' package, you get the classic short instrumentals ('Blue Peter', 'Guilty' etc), the best songs ('Moonlight Shadow', 'Crime of Passion' etc) on CD 1. CD2 brings generous snippets of the early full-length works - 'Tubular Bells' & the seminal 'Ommadawn', but these are supplemented by four live tracks, from a 4-year period ending in '84. Listen to 'Mount Teide' - LOUD - and tell me straight you don't believe in the power of live music - even in a recording - to move the soul and send shivers down the spine. Awesome.

This is kind of good, because then you can read any book in the series, but not neccesarily in order. The books explain what happened before (in the previous books) so it all makes sense.

An excellent piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the tradition of Star Wars Dogfights","review":"This book and the other three that I have read pointed out a lot of things I missed in the movies for example I completed didn't notice the A-wing that entered the seconded Death Star's exhaust port until I read that Tycho flew throught the Death Star to keep several Tie fighters and Tie Intercepters off of Wedge's and Lando's bask so they could destroy the Death Star. And the detail the Stackpole put in to the dogfights is the reason that I went out and bought Star Wars Rouge Sqaudren for Nintendo64. For those of you who watch Return of the Jedi just to see the Dogfights this is definetly the series of books for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Wing Series, Smash Hits!","review":"This book, X-Wing Rogue Squadron, is just the first of 3 books I've already read in this series. Stackpole does an excellent job in keeping you in an excited state starting with this first volume! I couldn't put them down! You will love this series if you are interested in flight combat, are curious about the warriors of Star Wars and, the Star Wars aliens & their unique contributions to the films. I loved how I could watch the movies and pick out the pilots that are in the books! So awesome! A bit of background on the planets, their associations with the films and what the aliens look like is helpful to bring your reading adventure into full HD, but it is truly, not necessary. Stackpole does a great job providing description for you, so sit back and enjoy because he'll keep your fighter engaged with every turn! For the fans...you GOTTA get this series. Start with X-Wing: Rogue Squadron and move into attack position!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun book set in the Star Wars Universe","review":"This book reads a little bit like military fiction. It focuses on a completely different part of the Star Wars Universe than most of the books out there. Instead of being all about lightsabers, Jedi, and the Force, this book is about a starfighter squadron, led by Wedge Antilles from the movies. It is an excellent book, full of excitement and interesting plots and subplots. A great read for Star Wars fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stackpole's Best Effort (It goes downhill from here)","review":"The first 3 books in this series are really just 1 very long book, since nothing gets resolved until the end of the 3rd book. None of the first 3 books in the series could stand alone, and the 4th book would be very difficult to understand without reading the other 3. This first book is Stackpole's best effort. At least there is some action, but the author describes it in such a cumbersome manner that it slows things down. Stackpole's characters are like cardboard cut outs compared to Allston who writes books 5 and 6 of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good but i've read better.","review":"I liked the originals all alot, same with Shadows of the Empire, they all get 5 but this wasn't really as good or deserving as they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this was the best in the X-Wing Serises","review":"This was a very good book.

Micheal Stackpole successfully mixes a story of action, love (sometimes true and sometimes not), and a Rebellion's fight against a falling Empire.

This book contains discussions between characters and situations, and twists and turns in the plot that keeps you guessing and makes you think. It provides multiple perspectives on the same story with incredibly detailed descriptions of situations, people, and the descriptions of the space battles are awesome!!! The plot lines are well thought out, and the elaboration on all things in the star wars universe that are un-force-related is fascinating. I am reading the subsequent novels in the series and so far, they are all equally exciting. This is the beginning of the story that stretches across 10 novels so its the best place to start.I highly reccomend this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This is the first book in the X-wing series, set 2 years after \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" It focuses on rebuilding the legendary Rogue Squadron (by, the way, in Star Wars: A New Hope {the book} there was no Rogue Squadron, it was known as Red Squad or Blue or something like that) rebuild after the fall of the Empire.

The author discusses his encounters with elephants over the course of his life in South Africa. Lurking beneath the surface is the possibility that the elephant's existence may go beyond the physical level. Elephants appear where they have not been seen for years. Lyall Watson encounters men whose life seems strangely connected on the spiritual level with the elephant.At times I was not sure whether Watson was sticking to non-fiction or whether maybe he was twisting the facts a little to make a better story. Perhaps, as is often the case, truth is stranger than fiction. Nevertheless, the case is made that elephants are sensitive, social, and mysterious beings who deserve a place to thrive on Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Like It","review":"This Is Only For Steroe Systems Not Studio To Light And Small I Would Rather Use The Ones From Technical Pro"},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable & easy to Use","review":"I'm a person who suffers with severe lymphedema!

No, you're not going to be able to read by this tiny single-LED light. What these marker lights are great for is precisely that: marking people, pets and objects you want to be able to locate in the dark. There is no spike on this item. There is instead a little clothespin-type clamp (and tiny tie-ring) that allows you to easily affix them to backpacks, tent peaks and guylines, your dog's collar or kids' beltloops. We use them to mark the stakes of our mess fly, so at night members of our party don't trip on the staked guylines, or worse, like stepping on a stake in bare feet. (Ouch!) In the woods, clip a few to the tops of your tents to help find your way \\"home\\" in the dark.The picture in the description is close to life-size. These things weigh almost nothing, and so are backpack-friendly. They are visible from a good 1000 feet away, line of sight.

I think they would only be of use for campsite marking if you attached them to the top of your tent or the car antenna of a nearby vehicle. Of course, if you have something as big as a vehicle near your campsite, you probably don't need these.However, I could see them being useful in a group of people, if you were hiking late at night and without any headlamps.

So this is the one to purchase. Many of the performances are worth the Set price by themselves. Number 48 is a great symphony for cheering up a blowsy day or attitude, and the others contain tremendous passions - literally in one case - normally not expected when listeners think of Haydn. The sound of the original LPs has been transferred reasonably well, with a degree of fidelity far more acceptable than many modern original instrument performances.For this price you will have several of the most glorious symphonies of the entire repetoire, and again, 48 is the crowning glory, if I may be allowed a small pun."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth trying","review":"this book was worth spending to buy. great advise. not just training for our family dog, but for the family as well. thank you again"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY DOOGIE","review":"THIS BOOK IS A GREAT HELP SO I CAN UNDERSTAND MY PUPPY AND HELP ME BE BETTER WITH HIM.

However, even though yes, I do understand that this is a child's book, it still fell a little flat. These are heroes that kids may look up to in the wrestling ring, and I did not feel that the average child would be able to relate to them drawn as children.

Therefore, any humour misses its mark.This book may be helpful for teachers who teach native speaker children (very young because the jokes and characters are so lame they'd insult an older learner) the finer points of English but it's worthless for ESL or EFL teachers.Lastly, at just 64 pages the US$10.95 plus shipping cost just isn't worth it.

In each chapter Cyndi gives you a reason to change a particular habit e.g. drinking water or eating chocolate (yes, eating chocolate). Each habit in and of itself is easy to incorporate into a busy lifestyle and once it has become a habit, well, then you don't have to think about it and you can move onto the next habit to change.This is a lifestyle book and I have enough patients that have been grateful for the change that I can't help but recommend the book.

The only down side is that this collection only covers up to Heavens Open, which means all Oldfield between Tubular Bells 2 and The forthcoming Millenium bell is nowhere to be seen. Heres hoping they will plug that gap for a future release. As for the competition, dont even consider The Complete Mike Oldfield, it does not come within 50 streets of this far superior release, even with the unbelievable running time, 4 Cds worth of Oldfield at his best, the excerpts are longer than on any other collection, and everything is more or less here in one form or another.

Cutler is hysterically funny before a live audience, telling these tales of his childhood (which ultimately evoke the quotidian brutality of Russian folktales as much as they do the slums of Glasgow) with their humorous evocations of dire poverty, constant family violence, and the helplessness of children as an almost supreme representation of reality -- heavy stuff, to be sure, so it's nice to hear him cracking up at his own jokes while he reads and fondles his wheezy old harmonium. The truly appreciative audience doesn't hurt either. Cutler's is a world like no one else's, and this particular glimpse into that world has not made as many roommates curse my very existence as, say, \\"Velvet Donkey\\" or \\"Prince Ivor\\" have, but it comes damned close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative and easy to read.","review":"Foaling horses is definetly a very long process especially if you intend on being there for the whole delivery.

Unlike a lot of games that require you to review the last two hours that you played and also require a substantial time contribution just to make some progress, this allows a person to pick it up, have some fun and put it back down. That being said you'll likely want to keep picking it up again and again because it is genuinely a nice distraction from anyone that has to think for a living.

Mario Galaxy is patiently waiting to play but I can't stop playing this. You use the remote to control what direction you shoot...like Tempest, and the nunchuck to control the direction you go...like Asteroids. There are so many dimensions to this game with drones, collecting geoms to help you score more as you shoot enemies, and a bunch of planets to unlock. There are even black holes that suck you, your enemies and even curves your line of fire.

Whoops. Unsupported.You can perhaps use a classic controller, if you're one of the three people who bought one, I guess.In addition, the actual gameplay is pretty uninspired.

The poor music choices, awful writing and Tim Allen's hammy voice work really wrecked it for me and my family. I'm tempted to replace the film's audio track with some classical music to see if that solves it.What's good? The photography is fantastic.

It is really something to see how smart they are.My one gripe about this movie would have to be Tim Allen's narration. He just didn't do that great of a job, some of his jokes, if you want to call then that, just fell flat, and kind of interrupted the story.Overall though you have to see this movie!

Not! I can't tell you how disappointed I was by this Disneynature Chimpanzee film. The narration by Tim Allen was dull and slow. His comments were stiff and overly-orchestrated. Not in sync with what we were seeing. The comments lacked substance and did not complement the scenes. As to the scenes: the majority of the shots taken of the Chimps were veiled by the trees and shadows of the forest. There were no sustained closeups of the Chimps' activities and daily lives.

I have seen other Disney Nature films and have continually been impressed with the quality of the film but also the quality of the story as the director and all others involved always do such a great job at telling the overall story itself that you are drawn in and do not want to leave until the movie is over. They have done it again in this film as you see the amazing tale of Oscar. This was a heart-warming tale that you will not want to miss, and not only is it entertaining, but it is educational as well. Tim Allen does a great job at narrating the story, and you will be amazed that the Disney Nature crew were able to capture the amazing journey of this chimpanzee, I know that I was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"Video quality was terrible on my high speed cable connection,I will never order another video from Amazon..I will stick with VuDu..

This beginning was a rambling about a woman waiting in an airport to fly on a junket to Jamaica. There was no ending.

All the five star reviews must have been from friends of the author.On my last novel, al-Qaeda Strikes Again, based on early reviews, I completely rewrote the beginning so that a body was discovered on the first page.

The end result was a blob of glass with two wires strung around it.While I was able to get 8 out of 10 lights to work after jamming them into each mount, I'm not certain they wont just pop themselves out while I'm driving.

Basically, if you really like malt, this doesn't taste like it. The only upside is that it's a little larger than most energy bars and it's filling but the taste is pretty bland.

Unless you know what package a class is in, you are going to spend lots-o-time looking around. And even when you find the class, it is not very helpful. You might as well use 'javap'. Plus, it is difficult to differentiate between the different packages. I wish the author had included the graphical layouts of the classes from the previous edition...even if the text version is similar.

Freaky Faron was listed as Sci-Fi/Fantasy, but in reality, it's a movie that could have aired on the Disney Channel. The plot is ridiculously stupid and is played out by actors who have hardly done anything before! Halverson was funny and entertaining as the freaky girl, who seems to be psychic and smarter than every one around her. Aside from that, this movie is not worth the reel it was recorded on.

They both worked more than adequately even in the rocky ground where first used. Remainder of the items are really not worth the price. Broom/pan are really small and cheap plastic. Stake puller may be OK in softer ground, but easily bent the first time it was used pulling stakes.

The mallet is on the heavy side but does the job; the stakes worked well enough, but the stake remover is on the cheap end for quality purposes (it bends a little too easily); the broom and dustpan help in a pinch, but the mesh bag is on the small side and kinda cheap.

The tent stakes are much better than the small ones the tent comes with (those bend, brake, and sometimes are impossible to get out of the ground). Everything in the kit is useful. The only complaint I had was with the stake remover. It broke the plastic part on a couple of stakes. I found it more effective to just use the tent to pull the stakes out of the ground. For the price, though, this can't be beat. I almost bought two of them just to get more stakes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Coleman Tent Kit.","review":"I say mini as it only has 4 tent stakes, which I guess is just what you need to secure just your main supports. The rubber hammer is perfect weight to be effective but not too heavy. The little dirt broom/pan is nice but hard to get into mesh bag as bristles keep getting caught in bag! The puller is great with my other tent stakes, but when I used to pull out the included stakes it broke the plastic tops off the stakes. Heavy duty stakes- cheap plastic tops. This puller works perfectly with the cheap plastic type stakes that have a round puller hole to insert into, no breaking, sure grip as well. overall for the $$ a good little kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really worth it.","review":"This kit seems like a decent idea. While some of it is, the stakes (specifically the tops) just don't hold up.The spike part of the stakes is fine. However if you're just a hair off the cheap plastic tops will snap off in a heartbeat. Whether staking down or pulling out.To be honest, the generic, full plastic stakes that came with the tent held up better. They may not last real long, but for how quick these can break you can buy a couple buckets of the general plastic ones.Naturally if you are camping in more rugged environments, you'll be spending the extra money for the really good stakes. However for the general use car camper, I'd look past this set and load up on the cheaper, heavier plastic ones. The lack of quality in the hook/eye portion of the stakes with this kit just aren't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coleman tent kit","review":"This might be useful for someone who has never camped before and doesn't have a broom, a claw hammer, or access to a Wal-mart store.

Needed more heavy duty stakes for my Coleman Sundome tent. Stakes will hold your tent down like a rock. Unfortunately, the stake puller is too weak to pull them out of the ground. The plastic top of the stake will also break when trying to get these out. The stake puller is simply a metal (aluminum maybe?) rod bent to a W shape with a handle on one end. It will get a stake out of soft wet ground, but will bend in drier harder soil. I'm not talking rocky soil, the stakes went into the ground with the help of the rubber hammer that comes with the kit.

Sure, I'm envious that he spends 200 days a year afield. With that, any decent dog should be good. Williams' text is thin on substance and speaks in generalities that common sense tells one. His voice has no flow, a point which is worsened when the editors make breaks between the paragraphs. The editors also have other faults which shouldn't be shouldered by Williams (\\"chuckar\\" and \\"chukar\\" listed on facing pages).Save yourself the time and money; Williams summarizes the topic as: the quality of the dog all comes down to genetics. He then changes that to 95% genetics and 5% training. He also says training approaches are individual based on owner and dog personalities.

His method centers around running experienced and novice dogs together so the youngsters will learn the game of hunting; good when you already have a string of trained dogs.However, upon bringing my 2nd pup home, this book really hit home. I ran the pup w/ the older dog ~50% of the time afield and had him searching, pointing, and backing at 7 months w/ little work on my part. His tips for working dogs together were invaluable and have really helped my pup come into his own as a bird finder!In addition, this book is loaded w/ great tips on hunting w/ pointers in general; it is well written and comes well recommended (after you check out the Smith and West methods)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best training book I've read","review":"This is the first book I would recommend for someone wanting to train their pointing dog. Ben Williams is an excellent writer. He takes the confusion out of the training process that so many beginners feel by keeping things simple. His philosophy is that a good bird dog is the result of 95% genes and 5% training. So let your dog just be a dog and do what it was bred to do. A trainer really doesn't have to be too hands on, he or she just needs to provide the necessary requirements of love, exercise and plenty of time out in the field which is the dog's classroom and favorite place to be. Good breeding will compensate for many training mistakes.I wish this book had some extra components in it such as an index, a first-aid contents list, and a problems section.

It really makes you think because no matter how much you love someone they can always turn out to be your worst enemy. It also shows that no matter how much you think you know someone they can always keep secrets from you. I think what made the book so good was because every minute someone would get a phone call or there would be a knock at the door and turn up the climax so you just couldn't put the book down. Everything that you expect to happen never happens. This book went along with real life and all the stuff that could acually happen in life. I definitely recommend readind this book but pay attention or you'll lose your place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled!","review":"Don't confuse this book like I did with We All Fall Down by Brian Caldwell. Same title, different authors. Having accidentialy ordered Cormier's, I read it. It was Ok, a descent enough suspense novel, although honestly, nothing much more than that. Caldwell's novel, though is a brutal, wrenching, disturbing exploration into evil and the end of the world. It's the kind of book that'll keep you up nights and stick with you for the rest of your life. Cormier's novel is good for passing a Sunday afternoon, Caldwell's is the kind of book that makes you look at who you are and the way you live in a totally different light."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was great!","review":"The book We All Fall Down by: Robert Cormier was very interesting. I enjoyed reading it. The book had a lot of surprises. Some things seem to be unbelieveable. How the law could drop such charges and not question more about the trashing. The book kept me suspious about who The Advenger was and I liked that the most. There was a lot of stalking going on in the story which made the book seem spooky and anticipating. All in all I enjoyed the book and recommend it to those who like to be challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"I read this book for school last year, and i was pretty excited to start it because it sounded like it would be good. By the time i got past the first chapter, however, I could tell that I was going to be disappointed. The author introduces a lot of issues into the book that he never really follows up on. For a book that is only a little over 100 pages, he shouldn't have included so many tangents that never seem to have any closure, and leaves you wondering what ever happened. The build-up to the climax, to find out who the \\"avenger\\" is, is the only good part about the book. I got a shock when i found out who it was, but the climax ended way too simply and way too early to keep me from being disappointed. It took me much longer to finish this book than it should have because I never wanted to read it. If i hadn't been forced to finish it, i probably wouldn't have. It's not worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is another bad book by Robert Cormier!!","review":"This book is about a girl who moved to anotherstate, and her house gets trashed. Mr. Cormierstretches the plot to the point that you want tothrow the book away and never see it again.I believe that all of Mr. Cormier's books are bad,and he is not a very good author in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read.","review":"This is by far the worst piece of 'literature' I have ever been unfortunate enough to read. This book is supposed to deal with 'real life' issues of young adults when in all actuality is nothing more than a shameless attempt at hack writing. Remember how R.L. Stine wrote crappy horror stories for children to make money... this is worse. Not only does it have nothing to do with adolescent issues, it in some ways promotes rape, drinking, and violence. This is by far the most horrible story I have ever read. This story is also not even written very well. Worst Book Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Children","review":"The book was given such a low rating from me, because how can this book be advertised as been appropriate for children under 15 or so? It's readily available on middle-school library shelves, where unsuspecting children, expecting a book in the vein of \\"The Chocolate Wars\\", pick up this book, and are left with more questions than answers.How many parents have been forced to deal with the issue of rape with their child due to their unintentional reading of the subject. Not to mention drug use, vandalism.Ugh. The system should be ashamed of putting such a book in the hands of children unprepared for such adult topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"From a house covered with a black shroud, arises a boy who was pushed off the edge of innocence by enviromental circumstances. Out a slowly crumbling house comes forth a girl who because of her fall from innocence she realizes who she truly is. \\"We All Fall Down\\" by Robert Cormier is the gripping tale of a boy struggling to better his shattered life and a girl whose whole life gets destroyed in one night. This book is a beautifully written tale of falling from innocence, growing up and self-discovery. I especially liked Cormier's writing style. He wrote this book in such a way that you could not help but get immersed in the rich story line and all too human characters. The only downside to this book was the curse words. If you are a teen or anyone who has fallen from innocence this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cormier Does It Again","review":"How does Robert Cormier manage to delve so deeply into all of his characters private thoughts, both good and bad, in just several hundred pages? Stephen King can't manage that in less than 1000 pages. I love this author! His books are not always emotionally easy to read (or listen to), but they are always thought provoking and written so well. This book is no exception. I continue to be impressed w/ Mr. Cormier"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sad Story of Loss","review":"In the smoldering flames of tragedy and violence, a love blooms and grows strong, but secrets and lies are eating away at its foundation.There came a point in this novel where I said to myself \\"If I stop reading now, I won't have to carry in my mind the burden of what is surely to come\\". But I eventually read on, and am now paying the price of Cormier's relentless, uncompromising ending. I feel a loss and and an ache that will fade in time, just as love may fade. Sometimes it is hard to be human, to feel, to love.Here we encounter a strong love between two teens, a love that is both uplifting and exciting. A doomed love, but is there no hope that somehow, someway, Cormier will provide a happy ending, a love regained? Cannot love conquer all? Buddy Walker, as you will see, will provide you with the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could have seen the future..I wouldn't have rented it","review":"I did not expect it to be great, but I like Nicolas Cage as an actor, so I took a chance.Wow.....it was bad...Hey, Let make a movie where the Actors mumble all the time and sulk. A movie where all the biblical clichés are fit into the plot somewhere, and ...yes we need that special surprise at the end that just rounds out a good movie.First 10 minutes were good...then I had to suffer through the rest. I think the most suspenseful part was when I paused the DVD to answer the phone... (My mistake...I should not have bothered to pause)I still like Nicolas Cage, but man did he get roped into a stinker or what?Don;t buy it or rent it..you'll lose 2 hours of your life you'll never get back.I can't say too much without giving spoilers away ...but there is not much you can't figure out and on your own..

So you can skip this or read it later I guess.I remember the first disaster film I saw, Towering Inferno, about a skyscraper going down. Now there are so many movies about the entire planet going down!Some people say this is Hollywood, using their frequent device of \\"predicitive programming.\\" Interesting concept.I just \\"love\\" how the aliens look with so much compassion on the human beings that they know are in imminent danger of obliteration. 'Course with all their incredible technology they don't bother to save more than two of them, children they place on another planet that is obviously meant to be a sort of garden of Eden, complete with what must be a Tree of Life.If you want to believe that aliens are your gods, & that they are going to sit back and watch while the planet is destroyed, wow, what fun. Bring extra popcorn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start to a bad ending","review":"A mysterious paper that ends up predicting all major catastrophes catches your attention. The movie starts out enjoyable, fun, and suspenseful; too bad the ending spoiled the film. The ending was weakly tied into the storyline, and really killed the plot. I won't go into details so as not to ruin the experience, but don't expect a blockbuster hit ending.I have no intention of purchasing this film. Rent it first before making it an addition to the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Cage plays the same character in every movie.","review":"Length:: 1:41 MinsThis is our review of Knowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Childish but not a children's film","review":"Nothing hung together! Watch it to see some Cage high anxiety facial expressions and a couple of scenes of him running. But then once you have the idea that he is stressed, fast forward to a couple of good disaster scenes. Then maybe look for another film to watch.I won't bother to list all the ways that the various parts of the film did not hang together LOGICALLY because with hundreds of reviews and comments before me surely these must have been covered and I don't want to be here all night just to defend saying that this was a silly film. I am pretty forgiving about big-buck films and small-buck films. But this one was a bomb across the board however one want's to classify it. Even seeing it largely as a religious film it falls quite short of the average ones that make the big screen. Of course it is above Bibleman, even though Bibleman does actually does move some viewers and get a few high ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Exciting film","review":"This film is probably one of Cage's best in the past few years. As his films have taken a downward spiral. However, Knowing is an exciting, mysterious, suspenseful film that puts two opposing theories against each other. Reguardless of your personal beliefs, Knowing is an enjoyable film that will leave you wondering. Watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great outing for Nicholas Cage","review":"Many famous actors start out in the action genre and then try to branch out into other types of movies such as comedy, drama, romance, etc... Many fail; examples include Sylvester Stallone, Keanu Reeves, and Bruce Willis. Nicholas Cage however, has done a decent job of doing movies outside of the shoot-em-up action. This under-rated sci-fi drama from 2009 is a good example. Heading a cast of mostly nobodies, Cage plays a widowed scientist whose son comes into the possession of knowledge of the future, including the end of the world. The movie then revolves around them figuring out what to do next. There are some action scenes, but the movie is really a sci-fi drama. Overall, great story with good dialogue and a great ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good special effects","review":"I bought this movie because (1)I am a Nicholas Cage fan,(2)The idea of the film is great and (3)The special effects in this movie were outstanding. That was the good part.For the most part I was bored with the story hoping that it would pick up. The actors (Cage too) were dull. The worst Nicholas Cage movie I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEJA VU","review":"I've only just got around to seeing this film/movie (March 2010). A competent film of its type. The CGI was not too cardboard and generally realistic. This story is not an uplifting one but then it could never be. I haven't read all the reviews - too many - so someone else might have picked up the flavour of Childhood's End by Arthur C Clarke. I read it years ago so I can't remember if there was the prediction element, but I certainly remember being very depressed by it for some time. But, hey, if we expected every film/story to be jolly, we'd all be deserving of deletion from the planet.Stevie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent B movie.

I liked the beginning when it showed the classic 1950's. It was kinda scary a few times with those 'Whisperers' The things that got to me were seeing the people burn after the plane crash, dying in the subway, and the depressing ending. Nicolas Cage did a really good job, as did everybody else, and thought the special effects were pretty cool, but toward the end seemed silly, involving some kind of alien/angel/demon thing. It was confusing toward the end. I probably wouldn't recommend KNOWING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie... prepare to be bored and little intrigued","review":"This movie was intriguing in the beginning, but the whole movie is rather monotone. There isn't any real action and the plot develops really slowly. Nicolas Cage gives us a rather boring performance with emotion that doesn't make you believe it's reality.Skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"Just not a great movie. The characters' actions and motivations often don't really make sense and the overall message is about as subtle as a sledge hammer. There are too many good movies (and books) out there to waste an evening on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preview was the best part","review":"This movie was bad on so many levels. Poor acting, bad plot, improbability, mythical, cheesy soundtrack. Best advice skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a good sci-fi film","review":"I just watched Knowing and was actually relieved when my dvd started skipping at the end.This movie was just bad all around. The acting was sub-par and there was no character development at all. Situations happened in the movie where there was no explanation given at all. An example was that the leading lady (I can't even remember her name) shows up at Cage's house, yet he never told her his name or how to get a hold of him.I felt no emotion for any of the characters and was actually happy to see the almost ending (I saw up until the last scene and figured it wasn't worth it to try to get my dvd player not to skip).I do not recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy FX, uncomfortable Cage, & goofy script","review":"I gave this 2 stars only for the depiction of pandemonium towards the end and the fact that it's mildly entertaining. Otherwise....spoilers below......Most of the FX are incredibly cheesy, the woman turns out to be an idiot, Nicolas Cage seems very uncomfortable the whole time, the dialogue is mostly pretty bad, and the script is definitely on the goofy side. At least there isn't a total deus ex machina, but where the kids end up--with the implication of a new Eden--is just plain silly.Good thing I had this one as a free rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"Basic idea behind this film - believe in god, go to heaven; don't believe in god - burn in hell. Not that heaven looks all that appealing, if it's inhabited by sinister non-talking angels who frighten you half to death. The production budget must have been high, but the acting is flat, the premise is incredibly flawed and unbelievable (not to mention boring), and you're left at the end wondering if that's all there is - a scary Eden. If you like fire and brimstone and the idea that nonbelievers, despite being fellow human beings and decent people, all burn in hell, you'll probably like this awful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepy and poor","review":"As someone who does not enjoy scary movies much, I would normally pass on watching this movie. However, I went to the movie with my boyfriend at the time (he persuaded me enough), and I sat with my eyes closed the majority of the time. If you do not like scary movies, poppy scenes, religion, or sci-fi, you probably won't like this movie. It was a very disturbing movie to say the least, but I will admit that it definitely makes you think. Had I been a fan of scary movies, I would say this is a decent movie, however the ending is just absolutely dredful. Both my boyfriend at the time and I walked out of the theater absolutely disgusted by the ending. Definitely not one of Nicholas Cage's best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicholas Cage tries to Channel \\"Signs\\" - fails","review":"Nicholas Cage tries to Channel \\"Signs\\" - fails, \\"I tried to make sense out of it\\" - but he didn't!Odd music and strange happenings do NOT make a movie, I used to want to see anything he did, no longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming, anticlimatic, and dull","review":"I won't give anything away about the movie because I don't believe in spoilers in reviews.

In the last fifteen minutes.it's yet another end of the world, we're all going to die, movie, with very little to recommend it.

I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Perhaps I was expecting too much. I thought this would be a good science thriller, and I really like Nicolas Cage. Instead, I found aliens and an ending with an idea that's already been done sooo many times. And a tree of knowledge thrown in at the end to make sure we knew what was being portrayed, in case we could possibly have missed it. I found Cage's acting to be stiff and equally disappointing. Actually, the entire movie seemed stiff and contrived to me, a hodge-podge of ideas from other movies, and totally predictable about half-way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What utter you know what this movie was! What happened to Nicolas Cage? He used to make great movies (Raising Arizona, Vampire's Kiss, etc.). Recent years - he's choosing horrible scripts and bringing nothing to these awful roles. But for Knowing - nothing and nobody could help this pointless movie. It's a ripoff of the movie Signs. Except Signs was well done with compelling characters and an interesting (and simple) story which let the characters be. Knowing has so many completely unnecessary plot twists which destroy the possibility that this film could have been a good story about a man's loss of faith and recovery in the face of apocalyptic circumstances. It just tries to do so much. The dialogue is so cliche - it actually makes me cringe. I just can't imagine who in Hollywood writes and supervises these scripts? I know there are capable folks though because the new Star Trek movie was fantastic. Story and dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Special-effects movie, nothing more, move along","review":"The movie would have rated 3-stars except for the silly ending.

These must be the same people who invested with Bernie Madoff or who bought stock in AIG. This end of the world film has only about 10 minutes of special effects. There is a passenger jet crash, a subway crash that looks like it was done with miniatures, and some quickie scenes of cities being consumed with flames during the last 7 minutes. The rest of the film is a total bore. Some people HATE Michael Bay, but at least when you watch a Michael Bay film, it's not going to be boring.

And, when it tried to shake things up, I though the storyline disappointed.It seems like it didn't know what type of a movie it wanted to be. It started by trying to be a thriller/drama that turned into an apocalyptic Sci-Fi movie (and a not very good one at that). It failed as a drama because it never developed the characters enough to make you care about them. The sci-fi elements were predictable. I believe that the scene at the very end of the movie was added only because they wanted to add some special effects.

I was compelled to write this review (my very first one) because of the varied comments about the final scene. Most reviews gave a favorable comment about the first 90 min. but were sour, disappointed, or enraged about the end. I thought it was refreshing to see a new approach on how,why, and where we might end up. This movie is fiction. It was all it was ever ment to be. A reminder from and old song \\" Well God only knows, and God makes his plans, the information is unavailable to the mortal man \\". Any instituion or anyone who thinks otherwise has been drinking too much Kool-aid. The movie itself was, I thought, well written and well directed. As for what I thought about the final scene I can say it was good to see how it brought up a wide range of emotional responces in people.

THIS MOVIE SUCKED. And those words don't even come close to doing it justice. This is like a bad Steven Segal movie, except that its Nick Cage, who is probably the only person on earth who is able to be an even worse actor. Honestly, you should be being paid to endure this movie, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. This was just....awful","review":"The premise wasn't bad really. A time capsule buried by a middle school and then dug up 50 years later contains a mysterious page filled with numbers. The child who discovers it in the capsule shows it to his father, who starts to see patterns in the numbers. Patterns that aren't real nice.Lately, we've seen a lot of movies which have 'surprise' endings that make you think 'Wow, never saw THAT coming!'. This tries to be one of those but not in a good way. After moving along one path, the movie suddenly turns into 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'. It's jarring and frankly it gave me a headache.When I was a kid in high school creative writing class, one of the things we learned was 'Never write yourself into a corner that you can't get out of without pulling a rabbit out of your hat, because that's cheating!'. Too bad the writers of this script didn't take that class. They even included the rabbit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"Terrible! Total piece of crap!

I like most of Nicolas Cage's movies and I think he's a GREAT actor. And I like disaster movies. It kinda looked a bit like the \\"Mothman Prophecy's\\". When the movie starts out it is pretty good and kinda erie. And all and all it was pretty good..... until the end that is. This is one of those rare movies where the ending CAN and DOES ruin the whole movie! I mean honestly Nicolas Cage coulda just sat in a chair the whole movie and the end result would have been the EXACT same! This movie's ending makes the ending the \\"The Village\\" look fantastic! And anyone who has seen that movie knows what I'm talking about. Honestly when i left the theater i actually felt that i had wasted two hours of my life that I'll NEVER get back. Save your money and time. DONT watch this movie!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"aliens will not save you","review":"I gave this movie 2 stars; but if it wasn't for the decent special effects, I would have given it 1 star. Why? Because of all the false teaching regarding Creation and the End of the World. Aliens did not put us on Earth; aliens will not save any of us when it is destroyed. Jesus is the beginning and the end; the Almighty, the Creator. There is much evidence from the Bible that Jesus will return soon. Unfortunately, movies like Knowing and 2012 are spreading lies about the End and other matters.Read what the Bible says about the End. Make no mistake; you will know when it happens, and you will know that God is bringing the End (it will not be some natural or man-made disaster). Take a moment and read 2 Thessalonians 1:7-10, and Revelation 6:14-17. View my profile; visit my website.

Fear, anger and irrational behavior are typical when dire prognostications are believed.It also points to 2012 solar storm and what happens leading up to the apex of the event and how it would look on Earth as it occurs, how the media reports and how government agencies respond all the way to the end.The cast works well with nic and his portrayal of the central character, they add to his emotioal portrayal in subtle ways that the audience is always able to follow what is going on in his world and his current and future choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky sci-fi thriller like X-Files","review":"I liked this movie. It's sort of a spooky sci-fi thriller like X-Files. The music, settings, etc. add much tension. It keeps your interest, and may blow your mind at times. Although, it also leaves some unanswered questions and inconsistencies.Great special FX and interesting visuals. A sequence involving an airplane crash stands out because of how real it seems, and it appeared to be all done in one shot. However, the scenes can be somewhat disturbing. My only problems are the ending gets a little hokey, and the movie should be a bit shorter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rental","review":"I read some reviews prior to renting and was hesitant to get it. I forgot I had it in my Blockbuster cue and it was sent to me. Maybe it was a sign? ;^)I finally watched it and it was actually not bad. Good popcorn flick. It is a little over the top, but it is a Nicolas Cage movie, after all.Some people had problems with the ending, but I found it appropriate for the plot, since life isn't always about happiness and victory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Without Going Overboard","review":"I was really pleased with Knowing. The first half was really interesting, and the characters are not only believable, but we can understand their pain and how they live. From the aha moment the code is revealed, we are thrust into wondering what will happen on the predicted day. I know some people were wanting to see more accidents and predictions, but I think there was a limited amount of time available to do so, and the movie gave just enough to verify the future was known. I won't go into too many details to spoil it for you, but I thought the end of the movie was really good. If you like science fiction movies regarding the end of times, etc... then you will enjoy the movie.Bottom Line: I was happy with the film, it was a bit longer than many, but wasn't boring at all. The ending was a bit of a surprise, but in a good way. So, if you enjoy Science Fiction or Suspense, Knowing is worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd Known","review":"The movie begins reasonably enough. A primary school class prepares essays for a 50 year time capsule. One little girl is seen busily writing a stream of digits onto a page which is snatched from her before she can finish and goes into the capsule. Enter Nick Cage 50 years later whose son becomes the recipient of this seemingly incomprehensible missive. The rest of the movie is a discovery of what this mysterious writing means and how the principal characters deal with the implications.A great hook, to be sure. However, if you are looking for an uplifting movie, I'd recommend you'd pass. The special effects are disturbing, graphic, but not necessarily gory. There is a certain detachment throughout which mollifies some of the impact of the concluding, fantastic ending.Not quite as big a downer as Kubrick's AI, \\"Knowing\\" probably merits at most one viewing. Wish I'd known."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, wrong number","review":"has the feel of a movie that might have been based on a really good scifi story, and then thoughtfully developed....instead, knowing has far too much difficulty deciding what it is about, and leaves that onerous task to you....oh yes, i regard it as the beginning of an explanation that k had no less than 4 writers; and what is infinitely worse....cage was one of them....actors are almost equally infallible at ruining movies they produce and perform in....dude, this just usn't your metier....ciao."},{"rating":"1","title":"minus 5 stars for stupidity","review":"I'm glad I'm not the only one that felt the EXACT same way.

The previous hours of the movie are COMPLETELY meaningless. That is what I realized when it ended. The whole numbers thing and their philosophical and religious musings were useless.

I'm trying to recall the names, but I can't. Anyway, a lot of biblical references, but I would say that it definitely isn't a bible-inspiring movie. It appears to have supernatural and demonic feelings in the beginning of the film, but as the movie progresses, while having you at the edge of your seat, you begin to see the whole picture. It went nowhere near where I thought the movie was going to go. I thought it was going to be a kid movie, in fact! I recommend this movie. I thought it was really awesome because I couldn't figure out what was going to happen next.*Estarr*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you something to ponder concerning the nature of reality.","review":"Personally, I found this film to be a worthwhile effort. I did not feel like I had wasted a couple of hours of my life. In fact, I felt that something whorthwhile had been added to my life to contemplate.Without giving anything away, there is a big concept at the heart of this script- it takes direct experience of the so called impossible to break through the modern materialist mindset. That is what astrophysicist Cage must contend with- the absolute shattering of his preceived image of how the world works. You can't get much more dramatic than that.As for the secondary theme of the end of the world, it is more than mere sensationalism..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject, poor writing.","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. I purchased it based on the commercials I saw on TV, and because Nicolas Cage was the main actor.The story line was good, but it lacked a good ending. Obviously, the writers didn't know what to do with it.This is not a good movie for Nicolas Cage credits. I expected much more from it.Too bad DVDs can't be returned - this is one that I would have returned post haste.Before I purchase another DVD I will pay Brighthouse for the money first to see if it is worth it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the end a whole lot of nothing","review":"This to me was a film that aspired to be many things yet ultimately left me feeling indifferent. I liked some of the concepts the director was playing with yet it all ends up falling apart into a sort of occult mish-mash, which is poor form given that the film is an attempt at science-fiction.

This movie just was plain weird. You can probably tell by most of the reviews that the movie is pretty cool, yet predictable up until the last half hour. Cage plays a good role, but the script is crap! You might recognize Chandler Canterbury from Benjamin Button, or that really creepy episode of Criminal Minds; He plays a naive boy that can't figure out that the voices that are whispering in his head are aliens. Overall the movie sucks, I only give it two stars, because Nicholas Cage did a pretty good acting job in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What sci-fi used to be","review":"While not a perfect film, I really enjoyed how this film hearkened back to the science fiction of old. Modern science fiction has simply become action/adventure in space (or wherever) and when you find a classic sci-fi film being made (i.e.Contactor Knowing), it's a good bet that most modern audiences aren't going to enjoy it.This isn't a bad movie, it's a great movie (poorly marketed) looking for an audience. If you enjoyedClose Encounters,Contact,2001, or similar flicks, I highly suggest you at least rent Knowing and give it a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Determinism wins; all human effort is irrelevant","review":"\\"Knowing\\" is a movie that starts out telling one sort of story, and ends with a different type of story. Without giving away any significant details, at the end of this you'll have realized that you spent two hours watching a story about striving to fight destiny -- and in the end, it's all futile; no humans can change anything. (Only creepy/helpful aliens can do that, and only for rare, special humans.)There are also quite a lot of annoying goofs in the movie, many of them having to do with being filmed in Australia but supposedly set in the northeastern USA (Massachusetts and New York).I'd strongly caution against watching \\"Knowing\\" unless you can handle an ending which has nothing to do with any actions taken by any of the characters. I found that quite unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad video in DVD ...","review":"I think that the industry should stop to make DVDs. This film is good, but the video on DVD is bad.

I had to watch it to the end out of morbid fascination. What is WRONG with Nicholas Cage?? How could a guy who did Raising Arizona allow himself to be in such garbage?? (don't answer, I know-- money)This was a jaw-droppingly stupid film, even the computer generated imagery was poorly done. Cage looks like he is undergoing a painful dental procedure throughout the entire film.Maybe it was made for kids? I don't know-- I don't have kids, but I think they may get scared by some of the scenes (not to mention the idiotic dialogue and plot).I don't think it HAD to be this bad, even though the plot frequently snaps temporary disbelief suspension. It certainly didn't have to be this schlocky! The ending was so sugary it was actually vomitrocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nic Cage used to make good movies","review":"What a pile this thing is.

The Spielberg/Rapture ending is unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope!","review":"This movie seemed to entertain Roger Ebert and so I gave it a shot even though Nic Cage's acting hasn't been worth anything since \\"Birdy\\". In any event, the story and logic behind this film are both quite lacking. Things just don't make sense on so many levels. And more than this, what is up with Hollywood's love affair of the end of the world? Its seems to be a very common theme these days. Perhaps they sense that their civilization is coming to an end when this is the quality of art it produces? The ending, and its aesthetic beauty and meaning was probably the only interesting thing about the movie. That and the minimal parallels to 20th Century Boys - a much better film and interesting read.

I think this is destined to be a sci-fi classic. That did not occur to me until the end. This film is a blend of thriller-horror-sci-fi under the rubric of apocalyptic. Though it's certainly not my favorite sci-film ever, it is worthy of the genre. The ambition to be a great sci-fi film is evident. Whether greatness was achieved is open to discussion, as is evident from the other reviews. But at least they tried. I don't think it's great but it is good and know this: it's never dull. It would be particularly unfortunate with this movie to think you know how it ends before you begin. If you like sci-fi, I think it's worth your while. If you hate sci-fi, it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather not.","review":"I may just be getting older, but it seems that recent movies have all, well, sucked. I honestly cannot think of a recent title which I have not been annoyed with. \\"Knowing\\" is no exception. I can't believe I used to think Nic Cage was kind of cool. Now, apparently, he selects work solely on the paycheck. It's no surprise, however, that the bigger the budget, the worse a film usually turns out. Anyway, I tried to tolerate \\"Knowing\\" as best I could, but the ending is so bad I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Aliens. Aliens are responsible for this crap, not Michael Bay but aliens. The movie is so cliche that it almost makes sense.

There is nothing new as far as the plot, the special effects were decent, and the acting was decent. The movie overall was a total waste of time and effort.

The characters reach out and embrace you from the very beginning, something that is often hard to do & lacking in modern pictures. Nicholas Cage was perfect in his role as MIT professor John Koestler and I doubt any other actor could have played this particular character any better. Chandler Caterbury was incredibly engaging in the role of Caleb Koestler, and again was perfect for his role!

The beginning is interesting and a great film with interesting relationships. The father/son relationship with the father being an alcoholic who tries to be a good father is well worth the watch. The end of the movie gets a tad convaluded and turns crazy, I also question why the movie had to turn biblical. I just don't really understand the purpose. It seems that for some reason these disaster movies always have to turn to religion to explain - this movie wants to use science, however, in doesn't in the end.I think you can enjoy this movie and the end of it if you can realize that it is pure fiction. Not science fiction. Just fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ideas seem to be stolen from the Bible just not as interesting.","review":"I watched this movie without \\"knowing\\" anything about it. If you don't know anything about the Bible you may like the film. It was very predictable in that it steals ideas from the Bible, and twists them with SCI-FI wierdness. If I was going to see an end times movie this with themes close to the Bible I would rather have seen it be more factual. Maybee Nickolas could have done his finger thing from Gone in 60 seconds, at least then I would have laughed at it more. If you were going to steal ideas might as well be from your own work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good apocalyptic SciFi","review":"An overlooked SciFi gem. Creepy and suspenseful. I think one of Nick Cage's better roles. Good screenplay, special effects and cinematography create tension and a sense of foreboding. I liked this story and would recommend. Other favorites: Red planet, Phenomenon, The Hidden, The Forgotten, Dark City, Starman, Screamers. If you saw and liked any of these you would like Knowing, too.

I wish I could believe that it was an off night, but it looks to me like they did not even rehearse for this gig. Spinal Tap's \\"Free Form Jazz Odyssey\\" sounded better than parts of this DVD. The transitions between the songs are sloppy and fumbling, West keeps fiddling with his settings on his guitar which he seemed to have problems with. This is probably a matter of taste, but I didn't like Richie Scarlett's bass playing on most of the set. The great Mountain comes off like a bar band not the great powerhouse that they once were.That being said, Leslie is in fine voice on the set and he can still scratch out some sparks. I wish he would go back to his signature sound though. He has mucked it up quite a bit.The real crime here is that the group put this thing out. It's a sub par product, that will probably only be watched once by Mountain fans (of which I am one).

I have seen Leslie about a dozen times through the 70's and he was one of my all time favorite guitarists. He got all kinds of sounds out of loads of wattage and minimal effects pedals. I loved the clean gut-wrenching cords and middle neck leads. Definitely the best as a live band. What happened??In Sea of Fire he's fiddling with all his effects through the whole show. He had a totally different sound than he used to. Every once in a while he would hit a cord that would make you flash back to an old show, but then I would snap out of it on his next cord or note when his digital delay crap kicked in. The show looks like it was taped in a Jr. High school gym with about 50 people in the audience. I have to agree, about the only good thing was some of the pictures of the Mountain of old.

For two weeks I hailed it as the best product ever made. However, I did notice it had trouble once in a while continually raking. My cat always utilized one side and pushed most of the litter to that side (that's what cats do). I purposely filled it well below the fill line and this seemed to help. The problem is the self-cleaning system does not appear to recover when the cat pushes most of the litter to one side, because of a design flaw. The system continually rakes back and forth, never able to reset, instead of passing over to recover and re-raking. Thus, in three short weeks the system has already broken; the motor continues but the rod and wheels do not. Worse off, the rack was stuck in the middle of the box, motor running, leaving my cat no where to go, expect on the floor next to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great ....unless your cat uses it","review":"This is my first review of any product that i've purchased online, hundreds of things, most of which came close enough to their intended use that it wasn't worth saying negative things about them.

The machine operates 10 minutes after the cat leaves. Just enough time for the urine to become a gooey mess. which sticks to the tines of the rack before the day is through. My cat seems to always urinate at the one spot, the same spot, which will make this machine inoperable by days end. the rack can't complete the circuit and has to return with nothing emptying into the containers.

It worked great; we had no issues at all but the motor finally gave out after 3 years of service for our 2 cats.We replaced it with this newer model and have had nothing but trouble since. It constantly jams, collects small pices of waste behind the rake, and the plastic waste container gets snagged by the rake on a regular basis causing the unit to stall. Also, if the power goes out or even flickers, the unit turns off. If we are traveling when the box turns off, it fills quickly due to the smaller box design and the cats begin to leave little surprises outside the box.Our cats became use to a clean box and now they are very unhappy.

Unfortunately, it would typically only run for a half day or so before jamming.Cons:- Not built to last. Very weak and poor construction. One of the rollers broke off after 8 months, making my box just a box.- Jams constantly. Even with light usage, expect to have to manually clean the box at least 2-3 times per week. A regular litter box will require much less work.- Not thorough with its cleaning. Mess will quickly build up within the box in the form of small chunks, especially behind the grill.- Really, really noisy motor.- Poor design for the waste containers section makes it very difficult to change containers without touching filth.- Exceptionally messy. Will toss litter all over the floor around the box.To summarize, I hate this product and would be unlikely to buy another item of any kind from Littermaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money if you know it is not going to be perfect.","review":"I got tired of cleaning my 2 cats paws when they step in their own \\"left overs\\".

I have not had to clean one dirty paw since I bought this.It is NOT perfect, you still have to scoop out the little pieces. But it's nice not to worry about it if you miss a day.The recepticals are expensive, so I highly reccomend buying liners for them on ebay instead.I do not like the Kabana it comes with, YES, it LOOKS great, but it is a pain to clean the box with that on there.I trid using different litters with this and honestly the best litter is called \\"Worlds Best Litter\\". It is worth the extra money, ONLY if your litter box is not in your living space because it tends to smell worse than regular litter. My litter box is in my basement, so I dont mind it.

I read up on this and there are 100s of complaints about the same thing happening to MANY MANY people. Plus, half of the litter falls all over the floor and even under the box and when you go to clean it out you have to touch way more yucky stuff than if you where to just use a scoop and a regular every day litter box.

With Steve McQueen heading an impressive cast (Karl Malden, Arthur Kennedy, Martin Landau, Brian Keith, Suzanne Pleshette, Janet Margolin, etc) you could almost see it as a last-gasp attempt to be the classic American Western as its narrative sends its hero from Texas to California via a chain gang in the Louisiana bayous. It could have been tighter and you have to question how merciful his final act is after putting that many holes in someone, but its an entertaining ride and the eternally under-appreciated Henry Hathaway makes it look particularly great in Scope. No extras, but at least the 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"We miss you, Stevie","review":"What more can I ask for on a lazy Saturday afternoon? I caught this film on TCM and wasn't disappointed. This was my first Steve McQueen western and as with all of his performances I've seen, everything about his acting is authentic and natural. I've never seen an actor so comfortable in his own body.

The original classical music is wonderful! However, the animation and overall \\"look\\" of the video is quite disappointing. It bears no relation to the beautiful illustrations in the book (other than the colors!), and has a very \\"computerized\\" look to it.

I finally gave up and went back to Bar Keeper's Friend, which does work. Americast may work for a bathroom sink, which gets little use.

It really does not last more than 2 days.The main reason for the poor review is the actual spray nozzle and \\"spray gun\\". The 'gun' is just a holder, it does not actually have its own nozzle. The product - even after shaking for literally minutes - does not come out even. It will either come out in large droplets or in a very fine mist with almost no color. Therefore, it's all but impossible to get an even coat.If the nozzle actually put out a fine mist all of the time, it would be worth the low price.

I have absolutlely no idea how the same product with the exact same packaging can be so different. Each cartridge I purchased after that was never even as close to the firsts quality.

After shaking the can real well i began to spray my arm and just like other reviews said, i got little running spots that i had to wipe away. I tried spraying closer and that just gave me a big droopy glob. Anyways i found the trick to this, you must spray this from a good enough distance in order to not get any dripping.You must have someone spray you because your arm is not going to get further enough to achieve this. When spraying the formula it needs to feel like your just barely getting sprayed with a mist, but dont worry your body will catch on tot he formula. The end result is a very beautiful natural looking glow.

This allowed the camera man to do close ups and still be out of the way.I've got news for those fools that don't think about when this concert was filmed...

The length is only 1 hour whereas the actual show was likely over 1.5 hours. I bought a bootleg of a concert for this tour (recorded in Glasgow May 1978). That show ran over 1.5 hours, and included lengthy, interesting solos from Bill Ward and Iommi. Every song on Paranoid was played, albeit not each one in full. Why the entire show cannot be put on DVD is beyond me. I really hope that in future a full length concert DVD of Black Sabbath will come out. Hopefully this would come from the Sabotage tour which is Sabbath at their peak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proven to be historically inaccurate!","review":"I was thrilled to purchase this book, only to find-straight away-inaccuracies in its claim of Tudor history.

The set includes not only the more familiar myths such as Greek and Roman, but pretty well succeeds in its goal to include all of humanity. The text is extremely detailed but very readable; none of the turgid prose so often associated with academia. The volumes contain numerous illustrations, both in the text and as plates (mostly black & white.)One of the most useful parts of the set is the final volume, an extremely detailed index, which allows the reader to pursue a theme, or even a topic as specific as the significance of belts, across all the volumes.

As a life-long reader of poetry from age 16 to 62 who especially prizes the uusual greats, e.g., Keats, Shelley, Yeats, Eliot, Herbert and of course Shakespeare, his poems compare favorably with these poets and are far better than virtually all poetry/fiction written in the last 50 years.

The main character's best friend, a tiny dragon with poisonous venom, exists to make sarcastic wisecracks that only the main character, Vlaad, can hear. On the whole, the chracters are uninteresting and flat. Vlaad is supposed to be an assassin, but he doesn't assassinate anyone in this book. The book also falls into the amateur fantasy novel trap: consant allusions to previous events and/or other people and locations that sound infinitely more interesting than the goings-on depicted. Brust's world is hardly as interesting as the multitude of other post-Tolkien fantasy universes; there is little to differentiate it from all the rest.Badly placed because it seems like the fifth or sixth novel in the series, not the opening.I give him two stars for effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Alot of people have given this book glowing reviews, and I really can't understand what they see in it. The characters are bad stereotypes, conflicts are resolved too easily, and the dialogue is flat and awkward. The humor that so many of these readers have raved about consists mainly of uninspired wisecracks. One thing that I particulary disliked was the way the author would continually allude to and explain events that had happened before the story took place. He did this ALOT. It felt like this was the 3rd, 4th, 5th book in the series and the author was trying to remind you of what had happened in previous books. But this was supposed to have been the first book in the series, the first book set in this world.

For the first hour and a half you could be fooled into thinking this is De Palma bringing us a superstylish, technically brilliant product that is at its heart rather cold and hollow but no.

This film though is a disaster. First, he falls into his old trap of trying to do Hitchcock better than the master. He clearly isn't up to the task. On top of this he has pasted on every cliche of French art film. But the real annoyance is the numerous times he resorts to cheap tricks for his suspense. You will not see the twists coming because they are so painfully illogical. And then the final insult...The \\"Dallas\\" trick. It was all a dream.Or a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the ending already!","review":"I tried to enjoy Femme Fatal, I really did. But this movie seemed to just drag on and on. Not only that, the plot of the movie was not really made clear until the end. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and the other woman making out at the first of the movie was just plain nasty. Rebecca's good looks is why I give Femme Fatal a second star and I would give it 2.5 stars just to be nice. I don't understand why so many people raved over this movie unless they just liked seeing Rebecca almost nude. Still, I would recommend seeing Femme Fatal at least once to see what you think of it but don't watch it if you're feeling sleepy or just not in a good mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Maybe it's just me. But I found this movie's plot very hard to follow. Only after it was thoroughly explained to me (as thoroughly as possible, since it leaves room for ambiguity) did I realize how truly awful and dumb it was.I won't give away any plot points here, but in my opinion, it relied on some cinematic devices that aren't clever - they're outright cheating. There are no likable characters, and I still don't understand what motivated them--nor do I care, anymore. The visuals were fine and there was some eye candy (excluding the pedestrian and plot-unrelated voyeurism, whose effect was more boring than beguiling), so I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.

It was very boring, much of it not even in English (subtitles). I finally fell asleep. When I woke up, it was right in the middle of another strip scene!!

THE ENTIRE HEIST IS BASED ON THIS ASSUMPTION! It turns out that everything isn't as we were led to believe, but it's still true that most of the crooks were willing to plan an entire heist based on the assumption that a beautiful woman can lure a complete stranger into having sex with her in a public toilet stall!

I have been looking forward to this for quite some time, but after sitting through this, I felt [gullable].I can agree the De Palme is an incredible director, and has many hits under his belt. This movie, however, will not be one of them. Rebecca Stamos acting and line delivery is terrible. Antonio Banderas wasn't given the chance to show his talent except for a small part in the hotel room, and no, I don't mean the sex scene.The movie dragged on and on and was not the least bit suspenseful.

In fact, I can say that some of his earlier efforts like Dressed to kill, Blow Out, Body Double, Carlito's way & Untouchables....just to name a few are examples of fine motion picture making. But, what we have here in FEMME FATALE is an absolute mis-mash. The opening sequence has got to be one of worst ever. The dialogues are lame. The camera work is similar to De Palma's earlier work Body Double...so nothing new there either. Critics say that the first 15~20 mins holds the key to a film's success. Femme Fatale loses it in the first ten minutes itself. Until a better effort....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess a bad movie has to be made every year or so....","review":"I haven't seen many downright bad movies in my lifetime and if I do I usually don't comment on them but this movie just gave me absolutely no choice. It had a very promising title and with Stamos on the front how could I resist it. Halfway through the movie, I was thinking of all the other things I could be doing with my time. Plot is horrible, acting is horrible, and the cinematography made me feel like I was seeing double the entire movie. Don't get me wrong, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is a work of art but I just don't think her acting can fill a lead role.

After that it was filled with all the charm of a second rate French Film, brought down even more with a \\"Pretending to be Gay\\" performance from Antonio Banderas.

His newest venture is very much a return to his old approach of style to burn. Working from his own script is certainly liberating for this filmmaker; this frees him from being hamstrung by profiteers like Cruise, who committed another crime against art when he put a straightjack on John Woo.Floating camera, split screen, etc. allows De Palma to get back to the basics as to why he started making films in the first place. If it is a matter of style over substance, so be it.Femme Fatale is well worth seeing if you have admired previous efforts like Blow Out, Phantom of the Paradise, etc. Welcome back, Brian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Femme Fatale","review":"At last I can watch this very absorbing and twisting tale (uninterupted by adverts on TV)"},{"rating":"2","title":"rebecca saves it","review":"I think it is fairly obvious to everyone who watched this movie that the plot is not very original at all. What I do not understand is why people complain about it in their reviews??? For those reviewers who crave for complicated story lines, I suggest Agatha Christie. For the rest, there are enough number of details in Femme Fatale for an erotic-thriller that almost anyone would like to watch it for a second time to absorb what is really going on. Also, Rebecca Romijn Stamos' performance is outstanding. It is worth to see this movie to witness that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one scene worth watching.","review":"One great striptease scene, but even then you won't see any full flesh.Rent it if you have to watch don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the Worst Movie Ever Made?","review":"Boy, Jeff Shannon is really off with his editorial review here. This movie is a real stinker, and fails on every possible level, beginning with the acting, the characters, and the story. Here's the catch: you have to see it to believe it, so how do you do that? Buy the DVD? Rent one? You've already lost by giving the filmmakers your money.IMHO, Brian DePalma lost his mind around the time he directed Bonfire of the Vanities. The most amazing thing about Femme Fatale is that anyone financed it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"little hit&alot of miss","review":"this film was interesting for a minute then it lost me.the story writing was a bit under developed on a whole&after a while the pacing of the film got fragged down.it had a few moments but not enough to maintain my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Wake Me Up - This Movie Put Me in a DEEP Sleep","review":"I had very high expectations for this movie, especially given a great Director, Robecca Romijn, and Antonio Banderas.Way wrong!

The plot is confusing when DePalma plays with backflashes (it needs more structure) and at the end theres is a twist. Some scenes are too hard to believe, the script is weak. Antonio Banderas needs to transform into the character he plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch it in Black and White","review":"This is a good 'un. With it's intricate plot and Hitchcock-ian detail/score I was thinking that it could possibly even be a BRILLIANT film if it was shot in black and white. So I turned off the color on my TV set and what I had now was a modern film noir masterpiece. Seriously. This is an incredible film. Do as I did. You'll only appreciate it even more.The acting is sloppy and the dialogue approach seems off. I would have said that Anthonio Banderas was miscast but, in truth, his character was written a bit too comical/campy at times. That's just my two cents. Get it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting on the way through, but bad ending","review":"Exciting in the beginning, real suspens in the middle, but ending to nowhere.

Despite what all people say in their reviews, there is only one reason the opening sequence is watchable (I'll leave it to you to find out, but you'll hardly notice the robbery taking place). The film develops, and develops, but the end is one of the corniest, most contrived ones I've ever seen. Are we supposed to BUY this (as in, accept the ending, not buy the movie...although it still applies)?

It doesn't work as good trash or as high camp. Edward Dmytryk directs Harold Robbins' source material with a lead foot. George Peppard made a larger artistic contribution when he was on \\"The A-Team\\". Alan Ladd, who had the misfortune to have this as his last film credit, essentially sleepwalks through this picture. It's equally unfortunate that talented actors like Carroll Baker, Elizabeth Ashley, and Martin Balsam are associated with this swill. Heck, I even feel bad for former boxing champ Archie Moore in his having to play the thankless role of houseboy. The film's lone redeeming quality are the costume designs by Edith Head(the women's lingeree in particular). If you must waste 150 minutes of your time it's better spent watching paint dry or grass grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the novel","review":"I'm a huge fan of the harold robbins novel but i've got to say that the film is every bit as good and probably better.

They lasted long (none of my prev. headphones lasted more than 2-3 months) and I'm still using them.I wear spectacles and at first they were a little uncomfortable around my ears but now I got used to them. One major irritant is the v-shaped frame. It doesn't sit properly at the back of the head and frequently touches the collar of my shirt.

These are not good for jogging. They get really uncomfortable to wear after about 30 minutes. Also the cord is way too long. I had to loop it several times so that it wasn't hanging ridiculously low. I thought perhaps if I used them when I wasn't jogging that they wouldn't be so uncomfortable. But I find that even when I am just sitting on the sofa with these on that my ears get tired from the weight within about 30 minutes. They sound ok (decent amount of bass), but since I can only wear them for about 30 minutes before they get uncomfortable, I don't find them worth owning.

They clean easily but like others have said the tops do come off the stick part so may not be the best idea to put them in the dishwasher. However, I think in a way the tops coming off is good because food might get inside there and it allows you to clean more thoroughly. I also like the different sizes they come in. Obviously I probably would have chosen a different color selection but hey, it was a great deal and I really don't care.

At $2 a spatula, they are worth a try. I like the pastel colors, and they are four different sizes. The handles seem sturdy, but reading another review, I know to keep them away from the heat. The handles easily separate from the tops, so they will go in that way in my dishwasher. I use spatulas every day, so if they don't hold up, I'll be revisiting this review.September 12, 2011 update: Well, over time, these did not hold up. Although they appear to be warranted for high, cooking heats, mine fell apart. I do not have a single one left. It is possible, however, that back in 2007 they were not made to withstand high heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Germs get in and never come out.","review":"I'm satified with the funtionality of these spatualas.

I had hoped to avoid this problem.From an everyday cooking point of view It's not really a problem but if you are at all concerned about food born illness, then you might pass on these. It's arguable thoguh that because you can remove the heads so easily that one can clean in the crevices thoughly. For the record I have never gotten sick from using any spatulas of this type but the point is made nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"I loved this book as a kid and it was over 20 years old then and this one was just like I remembered.

Yeah, there's \\"The In Crowd\\" and a few other hits, plus his version of \\"Hard Day's Night\\", which is the best cover I've ever heard of the song. Dare I say, I enjoy it more than the original Beatles version! But the rest of the mostly instrumental tracks on here are also contagious; running the gamut from lively jazz to more soulful, if not funky takes on standards like \\"Wade in the Water.\\" Ramsey Lewis is a big name in music, but yet I don't think he gets enough critical acclaim, not only for his piano playing, but especially for these early recordings he made with his trio. Classic, timeless music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone For Chess?","review":"Ramsey Lewis recorded a great body of infectious jazz for Leonard and Phil Chess on the Chess, Cadet and Argo labels. Much of the music is soul-jazz without the lengthy impovisations often found on jazz albums. This music had mass appeal and resulted in a fair number of hit records. e.g. A Hard Day's Night (Beatles hit), Hang on Sloopy (McCoy's hit), Wade in the Water, and The In Crowd (Dobie Gray hit). It would, however, be a mistake to view Ramsey Lewis as simply a soul-jazz player. He has an abundance of talent and creativity and can play quite effectively in more than one style.This collection represents an excellent value. Almost all of the hits are here at a very reasonable price. It's a great introduction to his music. Definitely worth five stars. I also recommend, among his many other releases, Maiden Voyage, written by Herbie Hancock. The title track has an ethereal quality and Ramsey Lewis' interpretation showcases his versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colleen Shannon Playboy DVD","review":"Well done, high quality Playmate DVD of one of the most beautiful and accomplished Playmates.Playboy Video Centerfold - 50th Anniversary Playmate"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"This little player provided my family with entertainment while we drove 2300 miles on our vacation. Our player worked fine hanging in its case, running off the car jack. Additionally, it works very well hooked up to a television. I was reluctant to buy Cyberhome, because I've heard horror stories, but out of the box this unit has impressed me as a great value.

My revised one should be here shortly. THIS ITEM IS CRAP!!!Foolishly I wrote:I've read all of the bad reviews about this product and must admit there are too many of them for there not to be some validity. However, I purchased this product for my husband for father's day and we both LOVE IT!!! He uses it daily and to date we have not had any problems.He doesn't mind removing and recharging the battery after each use. The picture quality is brilliant. The sound is awesome and it is a great bargain. Got it at target for $217 with a $20 gift card.I've read that I need to give it time to live up to it's bad reputation. I will post an update if I need to, but so far....GREAT!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Value","review":"We bought this portable player and travel bag for a great price. It worked great for our first trip. Second trip the battery, which was fully charged, ran out after about 1 hour. Since then it will not power up or run unless plugged into the wall or car outlet. Also, was unable to hook it up the our home television. The audio worked, but the video didn't. We've only had it 2 months, used it 2 times, and I'm returning it asap! Too bad Consumer Reports doesn't have more info on portable dvd players."},{"rating":"1","title":"bought two units, neither worked","review":"After the first battery charge, the first unit I purchased would not recharge the battery again. Not sure if the failure was the battery, the charger or the unit itself. Returned it and replaced it with a second unit (same model).The second unit failed right-off the box, as it would not read DVD's. The unit would start to run and within seconds would stop.Do not buy this brand. To have two units fail consecutively and in different ways is more than just a coincidence. Target should pull this brand off their inventory and not do business again with this irresponsible vendor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"beware!!!","review":"We bought this product to travel from Georgia to Maine for the summer, 2 months later it will not even charge.... we tried to go the cheap route, but our advice is to go ahead and spend the extra money!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of JUNK!!!!!","review":"I have returned two of these players in the past 2 weeks....Buy another brand.

I tested it and put it away for a month. Next time I tried, it didn't run from the battery and didn't charge it either. Soon it didn't even worked from AC when the dead battery was in the unit. I returned it and then learned from the CyberHome website that the battery should not be left in the unit. But they don't say if you leave it there then it will never work again. Having read tons of complaints about battery problems I decided not to give this model another try."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"I tried to buy this unit on sale and ended up waiting 3 weeks with a raincheck before finally locating one.

I then thought that maybe you need to charge them the night before you are going to use them. When we got to our destination I was going to charge them to make sure they worked. Well....it wouldn't charge them. A horrible product. I am back now trying to figure out a decent dvd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Charger does not work","review":"I bought this for my 19 month old daughter for car rides.

I am returning this to Walmart tomorrow. Buyers beware-price looks good but you are not going to get a lot of use out of it. Also gets very hot when plugged in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great - for a month","review":"When I purchased this DVD player, I found it a great combination of low price and excellent features. I used it for a couple of weeks and the picture was crystal clear, and the sound delivered. I was not thrilled with the quality of the car kit, and would recommend that you buy one separately. There are several good ones around. All of a sudden, the picture just went dead on it, and that's when the trouble started. Despite repeated calls (which always went to Voicemail) and Emails (all unanswered) to the technical services people at Cyberhome, i was never able to get an answer for either technical support or customer service. I finally gave up, swallowed the loss, and bought a polaroid. I have another Cyberhome product, a DVD recorder, and I am very pleased with that. I just hope it never needs warranty service."},{"rating":"1","title":"was not happy","review":"I was very happy when I got this dvd player home pluged is in and the player worked just fine but when it made to the car It worked for couple seconds you can hear the sound but no picture when i final got it to work it for 15minute then no picture again and it was like that for rest of the night I end up taking it for another but the store did not have any more so got another brand but i will say this it great price and it perfect for a small child on a road trip if you can get it to work right"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems!","review":"I plugged it in and charged the battery, removed the battery after full charge and put the machine away for our trip.We watched 1 movie on it and the second movie had trouble getting started.

Forget the battery - use the cigarette lighter adapter or power outlet in the vehicle. Get a headphone amplifier, because it's not really loud enough, but otherwise it works fine for what it is.<br /><br />If you want something durable with a long life expectancy that can survive being dropped by a child, then be prepared to stump up a few hundred more dollars for a name brand. But if cheap and cheerful is adequate for your needs then this should fit the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Please stay away from this DVD player!

The battery does not hold a charge (and removing it every time it is not in use is a major pain), the sound and video was often out of synch, black and flickering screen, and poor quality buttons that are unresponsive.It's unfortunate that this player has such terrible build quality because it does have a very nice picture for the price. The list of problems and issues make it impossible for me to reccomend it to anyone though."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is junk","review":"Do not buy this horrible product.

It also had a difficult time reading our dvd+r and kept stopping in the middle of the segments. I used the other machine and it died about 20 minutes after I started it and did not work properly even after I plugged it in.

It seems they had 'upgraded' (that's a laugh) the new one so none of the old bits (including a spare battery) worked. The second one came from K-Mart, and is a bigger load of crap than the first one. After charging the battery as instructed, it lasted exactly 10 minutes. This company should be closed down selling junk to innocent consumers.

We've had pretty much every problem imaginable: no picture, no sound, won't read discs, delayed sound, battery life nonexistent, bad picture, all of which have been sporadic. The last straw was the power jack in the back of the unit failed. We haven't used the unit much since our vacation in August and the warranty ran out two weeks prior to the power jack problem. Cyberhome wants over $99 for labor and $5 for parts--and they would cover the cost of parts IF they decided the unit was not abused (it wasn't).

After a week of use, the unit started to freeze up. Forget trying to use it with a car adapter as it acted very erratically to the power on/ power off situation you will encounter with the cigarette adapter.

My complaints with my previous units were that the controls were difficult to work. This product is vastly superior in that category. The controls are well placed, easy to read, work wonderfully and the picture is better than my laptop and several of my televisions in my house. However, the battery is woefully inadequate. The charge will last 30 minutes, if you are lucky, even when I recharge it between flights at the airport. It is just horrible. If you are using this in the car or plugged into a socket at home or in a hotel, this is a terrific unit and the picture is phenomenal. However, if you ever want to watch it using the battery, you are better off buying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"BETTER OFF SPENDING A BIT MORE MONEY","review":"I bought this unit and loved it. The image quality and ease of use were terrific. It was easy to unzip the included travel bag and use it in the car for my kids to watch. I also liked that it came with a car charge, which most do not and that I could fast forward or rewind without using the remote. Unfortunately, when I had it for four days, it stopped working properly. It had trouble reading and playing discs. If I went to rewind or fast forward, it would freeze and I needed to remove the battery and unplug the unit in order to use it again. Needless to say I returned it and bought the Panasonic which I both recommend and love. The accessories that are included with this unit are great but they serve no purpose if the until itself is not reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I take it all back!!!

I guess all these collections are the best that classical music have to offer for anyone interested in getting to know these 3 classical giants.This particular one hosts 26 Cds (one cd is double)so that is why the product description of 1-25 is confusing.An excerpt of the content is of course on amazon for all to listen to, so I do not need to dwell on that here. All I can say is that Deutsche Grammophon proves once again they are the top of the line on classical music products. This is a beautiful collection, the best performers, the best sound quality and very affordable.

It was slow to start. I thought the story line was really good and the characters were likable but it lacked something......... I think it was the chemistry. You were wondering for more than 1/2 the book WHO the male lead was. Then at the end you're left with NO WAY a Montgomery. I was disappointed but I will keep looking for her books because I like her characters especially the Montgomeries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this THE Jude Deveraux?","review":"What happened to this great storyteller?She is still a good writer, but there is no story. Since the plot is outlined elsewhere, I will detail my problems with it herewith.I was not engaged by the heroine, Eden, I strongly disliked Melissa, Eden's daughter, and never felt I got to REALLY know either of her suitors. This plot drags and stumbles and leaves the reader asking more questions than are answered! Who in their right mind would NOT dig up the buried treasure, WHO?

In a few days I will also be using it for bottles too. I like how you have options on which basket to use. The bigger one holds quit a bit and I have 3 using sippies right now. Not sure about the round thing. I think you could use it for just about anything you need it to be. I haven't had a reason to use it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottle Parts Don't Come Out Clean","review":"Why use these baskets if I have to hand-wash all the parts again? I suppose you can load a couple of items at a time and then the baskets work. The oversized nipples do not fit in the appropriate compartment. If you use the standard size (which seem to be rare nowadays) you can load 10 at a time. And if this is all you have, 10 nipples, 10 rings, the basket will be great for you. But then why would you need the extra ones? The baskets' sizes are odd to me. They don't really fit well on the top rack of my dishwasher (Bosch), widthwise. The round basket was never even used. All-in-all, I end up with washing all the parts by hand to make sure they are clean. I was tired of taking out caps and rings with milk spots, as I use Born Free bottles, which happen to have \\"too many parts\\" (see my other review)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good!","review":"The baskets are good sized to hold most infant feeding items including spoons, bottles, breast pump accessories and more. My only complaint is that the valve container is a little misleading. The openings are still too big for breast pump valves but nowhere in the information on the product does it clarify that it is actually designed for the larger sippy cup valves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baskets for bottles and parts","review":"Agree with much of the positive reviews here, and wanted to add that the baskets are slender enough across to fit our standard dishwasher top rack without straddling wires, which I was a little worried about. Taking away one star because the nipples undertray is great but tends to squish the nipples a bit when you close it -- either I'm not loading properly or the nipples are too big (? because they're newborn) or it's just a bit shorter than it needs to be. Still, everything seems to get clean and I'd say this is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy","review":"I use Playtex DropIns bottles/nipples, which are larger than average nipples. These nipples do NOT fit well in the nipple compartment of this dishwasher basket. I can only wash 3 nipples at a time in this basket. The latches to open the different compartments are very snug, making it difficult to open them quickly or with only one hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Helpful","review":"I thought that this would be really helpful when it comes to making sure that I have clean nipples for my baby. Unfortunately, when you read the instructions for most latex nipples, they aren't dishwasher safe, and you are instructed to hand wash. So, having a dishwasher container for nipples is pretty useless. I use mine as a container that I can airdry my handwashed nipples in. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice","review":"I purchased this after receiving 4 individual knives for Christmas. I wanted storage that was big enough if I wanted to add more knives but didn't look strange if only storing my 4. This met my needs perfectly. If you have a larger set of knives or you need more space than this tray offers, I would consider actually purchasing two of them and placing them side by side. Just a thought. The tray looks great in my drawer and fits perfectly, even when holding my knives. I would recommend this to family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Item Now Defective","review":"I bought one in oak months ago that is a quality item. Perfect for a few knives in a drawer or for moving knives safely. The only drawback is that knives with a protruding lower finger guard do not seat correctly. However, another one I ordered recently in Beech was obviously defective: slats were not spaced correcly on the dowels and a jagged knot would scratch your hand (I sent it back). It is too bad that a company like Wusthof that has spent years building a good reputation would ruin it by putting their name on items sold with no quality control and that Amazon would ship such an obviously defective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wusthof Indrawer Knike Tray","review":"This Wusthof 7-slot in-drawer knike storage tray holds 7 large and small knifes safely and are easy to get too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sorter","review":"Works great, organizes knives in drawers.

Vanessa is whiney, immature, childish, annoying and selfish. The problems that she had with Parker to make her so scared are never clear. She never wants to talk about it or even think about it, so you never know what happened and what whe did talk about was not really all that bad to actually scare a woman. I though Nick was areally good guy. Why he stuck around for any of that is anyones guess. I liked Rodney. He was cool. And being that this is the first book that I have read by Linda, it does not give a good out look. The other reviews say that this is not her usual style and usually her books are not so crappy. I hope so. This wins the award of \\"Worst book read....EVER\\". Yep, its that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little light","review":"An exploration of the deeper differences between two men (ex-husband and new lover) who were externally the same (jocks and playboys) would have been interesting, but this book offered no insight and was very light on character development. As a baseball fan I was also disappointed that Ms. Miller did not seem to do any research. The sports press always identifies a major league picther by handedness -- it's as natural as breathing, 'Lefty Parker Lawrence' or 'big right-handed Parker Lawrence'; plus she had the press comparing him to \\"Hank Aaron and Pete Rose\\" -- both known as hitters which an American League pitcher would not be: How about pitchers like Sandy Koufax or the more modern (and American League) Roger Clemens, Pedro Martinez or Dwight Gooden? Ms. Miller, don't forget women readers can be baseball fans too."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst!","review":"I started reading this book earlier today, I thought it was going to be an enjoyable read seeing that I liked other Linda Lael Miller books, but this one was a total washout!

The next day they are joging together and are acting like lovers. This new man, Nick, is the one that is in controll of the entire relationship. Vanessa is shallow and has no charecter at all, all her friends seem to know what is best for her and she follows this, she has no backbone, or should I say brains at all!

It features Alfred Deller at his most idiosyncratic, which is fine in his best repertoire (lutesongs, etc.), but which can be quite excruciating in ths recording. It may not be helped by the way thay were all miked, as there is a lot of Deller and a bit of a mush made of everyone else. One plus to come out of it, though, is the voice of his on, Mark, singing alto and tenor at different times (made possible by transposition from the usual keys). It sounds like a lighter version of Alfred at his most lyrical and smooth. One wonders why he didn't make more of a name for himself as a countertenor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alvino is an acquired taste","review":"Alvino Rey and Stan Kenton are two truly fine big bands that I think you either love or hate.

His band is tight with lovely intonation, but its ruined by Mr.Rey and his screeching strings. After awhile it was banned from even being played in the house!

The episodes were not well thought out and extremely short, the animation was one step above stick figures and claymation, and the dialog was choppy. Each teeny, tiny episode had some sexual innuendo to it, even where there was no need or interest. I would not recommend this to anyone, not even to borrow.

She will tell you so herself within the very first pages of the book - and keep telling you how wonderful & Christian she is as she shops at Prada & Ann Taylor in her Audi TT convertible.I got very tired of the snottiness, hypocrisy, and very superior attitude of Ashley. She judges everyone in her life as inferior while she's God's Chosen One. So shallow and critical of others - what a great example of a Christian in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but...","review":"I like chick lit and I've been reading more Christian women's fiction lately, but this book just left me cold. I felt like Ashley's Christianity was just kind of \\"tacked-on\\" like that was supposed to be her quirk - some heroines are heavy, some are klutzy, and she's Christian. I don't think that a Christian has to wear sackcloth and ashes, but the constant name-dropping and looking down at everyone didn't seem very Christian to me. By the way, I don't think anyone in the Silicon Valley would be that surprised that her brother met a Chinese-American woman - last time I looked, Northern California is a pretty multi-cultural place. Some of the book was very funny, but overall it just didn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Book","review":"As a Christian who just also happens to be a person of color, single, educated, and Bay-Area bred, I found this book to be quite offensive. It's a slap in the face to open-minded and discerning Christians who can enjoy life without judging and proselytizing. There are definite racist overtones and an obvious antipathy towards anyone who doesn't aspire to be white, barefoot, pregnant (but legitimately so), underachieving, and bible-thumping. Don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking...","review":"Despite clever and witty writing, the story line lacks much to be desired.

It wouldn't even had mattered if she did redeem herself at some point in the book b/c I found this character so unlikeable that I couldn't root for her. It made my stomach churn with disgust as every sentene was complaint after complaint. Save yourself the time and money and skip this book and it's series as it will only make you feel depressed that this ever made it from the editing desk to be bought buy readers.

Very sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird racist overtones?","review":"I too am excited about the burgeoning genre of Christian Chick-lit, and I did enjoy Ms. Billerbeck's work.

But particularly not so for a Christian. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! This girl doesn't want this book.","review":"I purchased this book on Ebay and even though I only spent $4 it wasn't remotely worth it. I knew by the end of page 1 that I wasn't going to like this book but I forced myself to keep reading, hoping it would get better. I finished the 1st chapter and tried to start the 2nd but I just couldn't take any more. I was going to go back and count how many times she mentioned her religion or living in Silicon Valley but it would have been a waste of my time. Only read this book if the constant whining about religion is something that interests you. Me, it made me want to throw up. So freaking preachy. If I wanted to feel like I was in church I would go there instead of the beach. Waste of paper. I'm going to re-sell it but I feel sorry for the next sucker that falls for the description on the back which doesn't mention the holier-than-thou attitude of the character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seek ye first ... Prada","review":"Oh brother. So poor Ashley can't find a man. How surprising! After all, isn't every guy's fantasy to marry a self-absorbed, judgemental, obnoxious, white supremacist, shopping-obsessed clothes horse? File this one under unsolved mysteries of dating.If you can \\"relate\\" to Ashley, here's a clue: if you want to get married, become marriagable. That means devoting one or more brain cells to thinking about others instead of yourself. Become empathetic, learn to listen without judging, get involved, develop interests beyond tonight's reality TV show, really LIVE your faith instead of just yammering about it, and men will be lining up to ask you out on dates. Men know that you how behave prior to marriage is an excellent predictor of how you will be in a marriage, and they're *scared off* by women who strike them as selfish spendthrifts - like, say, Miss Ashley."},{"rating":"1","title":"Materialism, with a side of racism.","review":"Now, I love shoes and fashion. However, the fact that Ashley turns to fashion when she feels stressed (273) rather than depending on say, God, is a little distressing.And the racism? Blatant, rampant, and unapologetic. People like Ashley is what is wrong with Christianity today. I think I'd rather stick to secular Chicklit than have to put up with Billberbeck's propagation of stereotypes and prejudices.Save your money -- and check out Marian Keyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-Out-Loud Funny","review":"In this book, you will laugh alongside Ashley, a 31 yr old woman who is beginning to feel she's past her prime. Struggling with a demanding career, a not-so-ideal family, a church singles group, a married best friend, and infatuation, Ashley's life is anything but ordinary! An interesting mix of fashion sense, conversations with God, and the self-doubt all women have, this book is not to be missed!

I was oblivious to rainstorms, howling winds, traffic tie-ups on Interstate 90 in Chicago (just gave me more time to read) and food stops. Okay, I really did notice the food stops, but the book stayed with me!What a delightful read. Billerbeck handled the setting and story line with an ease that made Ashley's turmoils flow realistically. As a bridal consultant, I've seen Ashley's name-dropping nature countless times. Billerbeck and WestBow deserve a pat on the back for breaking the mold of Christian literature, giving an alternative to predictability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone, one major drawback","review":"The shine is a very good phone, definitely looks great, sound is clear as well as reception.

The shine effect, the signal quality, software, and batery lasting are very good. I first though than the battery would drain out in 1 day, but the phone with normal use lasts for 3 days no problem and 4 days if you don't talk to much.

I apparently had to configure setting with ATT before I could use the itnernet+texting. If you're buying this phone, I recomend talking to your service plan and making sure that it will be able to work effortlessly. Otherwise, it's kinda hard to use. Also, if you live in america, I'd suggest just getting the ATT lg phone. This is the international version and when you buy it, it costs around 130-140-150 dollars. Mine cost me 147 dollars. The ATT phone that you get from the store, without contract, is 160 dollars. I returned this phone right away because it just wouldn't work. Buyer beware I guess =["},{"rating":"1","title":"Very high expectations and was very dissappointed","review":"This book was horrible for what I expected. Almost an entire chapter was dedicated to calculating BA, OBP, and SLG. Come on!The author felt the need to spend an entire chapter on his mind-numbing strategy for betting on baseball games. Bet when you think the true odds on a team are less than the actual odds. Wow, that's ground breaking stuff! Also, bet against the teams that have a large following and you will get better odds. Ya think?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A purposeful introduction to probability","review":"This book perpetrates a wonderful trick. The author presents a number of engaging questions in the context of baseball and gambling. Then before you can put the book down you have been taken through some fundamental concepts of probability without being aware that the book is teaching something that looks suspiciuosly like math. The concepts are presented at a level that requires some focus but challenges the reader to come away with a real sense of accomplishment. I enjoyed the book thoroughly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Little Baseball","review":"Only about 20% of this book is about baseball. If the author didn't have his own agenda, it could have been closer to 80 or 90%. The best parts of the book are Appendix 1 (almost all SABR material) and the annotated bibliography. A good idea squandered."},{"rating":"1","title":"All you ever wanted to know about roulette","review":"Unless you can't calcuate a batting average, OBP, SLG, or OPS, this book has very little to do with sabermetrics or using statistics to study baseball. In the last chapter he glosses over some scholarly baseball/statistics articles but really gives them a poor treatment. But most of the book is about betting and probabilities in roulette.Interesting sections on clutch and streak hitting were discussed at a surface level. This would have been a great setting to describe the mathematics and methods of analysis to test the hypotheses that players get hot or are clutch hitters. But alas, no.Don't waste your $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"The way to think about odds","review":"This book gives a gentle introduction to probability and odds. It's not a statistics text and doesn't pretend to be one, though the last chapter discusses some questions that can really only be answered using statistical methods. The author makes it clear that the models he discusses, and often illustrates with familiar examples, are only approximations to real-world baseball (if there is such a thing). There's genuine math, presented in an engagingly informal style at about a high school level. Not enough to guarantee the reader will win at sports gambling, but enough to give a feeling for how the pros might do it. Along the way, there are tidbits of baseball lore salted with the author's frankly personal opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Although I believe there is no easy way to edit yourself, (because your simply to close to your own writing) this book is definitely a start.

The knives are made in China and are not the same kind or quality of knives I have bought from Sabatier before. The manufacturer's box (not the shipping carton from Amazon.com) came with a large hole in it and one knife had a rusted scratch on it.If you want or need inexpensive, this is surely that, and you may be satisfied with the set. But if you want Sabatier's fine knives, these are NOT them. In this, as in most else, you get what you pay for. A single fine Sabatier knife would you usually run the same price they ask for this entire set.To iterate, if you just want some inexpensive knives, you may be satisfied with the set.

But this product really deserves the worst possible rating.I started off cutting vegetables. The blade was so dull I applied more pressure than I was comfortable with, and was afraid I would slip and injure myself. Paring knife could not peel fruits at all. The handles were plastic and seemed like they were glued on. No rivets.I paid $14 for this product.

I made mine when purchased this item over a year ago here on amazon and paid $19.99 for it. At the time thought it was a good deal after reading the reviews.The shear was pretty good. The steak knives are sharp. The rest, however, is dull. If you are single and don't cook much and have a limited budget, then this set might be for you. But I cook daily, and it's just frustrating to cut my meat and vegetables with these knives. You also have to wash them right after you use them otherwise they'll rust.

The handles are atrocious-- slippery, awkward, uncomfortable, at a bad angle.2. The blades easily rust and arrive very dull. They require constant re-sharpening. Furthermore, they are at a horrible angle with the handle, making it awkward and uncomfortable to chop easily or fast.3. High maintainence. The only way to preserve the blades is to hand-wash them, dry them, and immediately oil them.4. These knives are too light and flimsy. The chef-knife is not full-tang and does not have a bolster. Therefore, it is difficult to mince and dice.These are not a decent set of knives. If you spend twice as much or more, you'll get far better quality. Definitely DO NOT buy these knives if you are looking for just one good decent set of knives for your kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"When I received this product I only received 13 knives instead of the 14 that I was supposed to.

The included knives don't even fill all the slots in the included block.

I should have heeded the reviews from others who said that these knives practically rust in front of your eyes. I am very conscientious about washing my knives in hot soapy water and drying them right away, but these blades are IMPOSSIBLE to safeguard from corrosion.Finally, as a further knife to the heart (so to speak...), their cutting properties are minimal.

Somewhere along the line, these companies need to realize that the street price is nowhere near the list.

Tetsuo's laugh, for instance, has to be one of the most chilling sounds on record, and there's some odd interweaving of different tracks from the *real* soundtrack that might've been promising given a little more time.

To date we have prepared about 6 recipes from this book. They are perfect. The are (generally) easy to prepare and taste exactly like those found in the many restaurants from San Antonio to Ciudad Acuna. The history included in the sections between the recipes is fascinating and makes a great read. I have read this book cover to cover and I intend to make all these recipes eventually. Kudos to Rob Walsh (and to Diane Kennedy, who's arrogance and exclusion of Tex Mex created a genre of cooking). Rob, you book dominates Diane's stilted, boring texts. Now, next time add Pericos and Taco Tapatillos and we will be in business!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"There are a lot of really great customer reviews for this book already.

Being able to get tips on improving my own home recipies and learning the ones I never knew how to make (barbacoa, tamales) has made me a popular chef with my friends.

It goes into detail on the food the cultural heritage and even the Tex Mex recipes. It also has old photos to some of the modern day photos. I think anyone wanting to enjoy tex mex cooking or open a Tex mex restaurant should buy this book and read it. I will admit I was skeptical at first but the more I read in the book the more I liked it. I believe we should have more books like this book and I am thankful the author of this book took the time and trouble to write this book and find these photos.I hope many more books can connect us to the culture of the people who made these recipes or in some cases the recipes were dedicated to.

Probably the best funk album ever recorded in Brazil, and certainly one of the best Brazilian pop albums as well. Features the often-anthologized \\"Umbabarauma\\" and the super-funky \\"Xica da Silva,\\" along with a whole slew of other great tracks, such as the James Brown/Sly Stone inspired \\"Hermes Trismegisto Escriveu\\" and other groove-heavy wonders. A couple of songs are too shrill -- less disco flirtations than just plain old pop-funk gone jittery. One such track is an unfortunate remake of \\"Taj Mahal,\\" the song from which Rod Stewart swiped the melody to \\"If You Think I'm Sexy\\"... Nevertheless, this is a masterpiece, one of the best Brazilian albums of the '70s.

However, i am not blaming the authors: I doubt I could have done any better at writing a book about poll results.The most interesting discussion involved the stories of ostracization told by some the Atheists in the poll. When they lost their faith, they did not desert their families and friends - their families and friends deserted them.The rest of the results paint a picture of the typical Atheist, who except for disbelief in religion, is not all that different from anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atheists, a subgroup of the \\"nones\\"","review":"This book should be of interest to people of all beliefs. The authors of this book have conducted a very detailed study into the viewpoints of American and Canadian Atheists, and compared them to Christian groups.

The geochemistry section is clear for those of us who are not specialists in the field. The history of research concerning the K/T event is interesting in its coverage of the progression from denial to cautious scepticm to acceptance. The elucidation of pre K/T extinctions was new to this reviewer and does give a different impression of earth history and the progression of evolution. Overall it is a good book for the lay public and those in the sciences who are not versed in extinctions and bolide impacts through time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Entertaining","review":"This book is an entertaining and informative explanation of how scientists posed the theory that an asteriod had caused the mass extinction of the dinosaurs at the end of the Cretaceous, found evidence that supported the theory, searched for the crater, and eventually linked the Chicxulub Crater in the Yucatan Peninsula to the extinctions.This book is also a wonderful illustration of how the scientific process works, what scientific controversy looks like, and how people from many different scientific disciplines can work together to advance knowledge. The author provides enough background information for the lay reader to understand the basic situation, but not so much that the reader gets bogged down in details. With a publication date of 1999, it is perhaps a bit dated, but it is well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, but a bit far-fetched","review":"This book is an interesting blend of fact and fiction. I recommend it for horror/suspense novel fans. It is well-written, in the same intriguing style as the author's true crime books, and I like the way it combines fact (Ed Gein's story) with fiction. However, if the reader is not already well versed in the true story of Ed Gein, he or she may have trouble knowing where the fact ends and the fiction begins. Still, it is an entertaining story, even if it is a bit far-fetched, as are most novels that try to mimic true crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not as good as his Biography works!","review":"The biographies Mr. Schecter has completed are far superior to this(in my opinion only) really bad fiction piece.

Musically their performance is fine, the mix is impressive, and the production is flawless - except for the frequency of the close-ups that show how old these guys really are.

Well I came here to Oregon for vacation and I saw this DVD in a store. I finally bought it a couple days ago, and I have watched it a few times already. I think it is a great live performance and an essential DVD for Slayer fans. The song selection is okay, there are some changes I would have made, but that is my only complaint.

Their is also an abundance of new soon to be classics such as \\"Disciple\\", \\"New Faith\\", \\"Here Comes the Pain\\", and \\"Stain of Mind\\" being played.

Slayer forever baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"War at the Warfield ok, but Still Reigning is perfection","review":"I first bought War at the Warfield in August of 2003. At the time, it was my first live Slayer video purchase. I fell in love with the band upon first viewing and thought it was the best metal DVD ever. But after a couple of months, I lost interest in viewing it because the live performance seemed uneven in places. For example, the opening number Disciple has a machine gun-style blitz beginning which Slayer has never done again. Dittohead also has a kind of compressed explosive feel which gives the song an unnatural sound. A year later, I bought Reign In Blood Live: Still Reigning and my love for Slayer has been more than reaffirmed. Tom's voice sounds more powerful and Slayer even plays with more energy. I guess this proves that Slayer is an their very best live when performing their best material, Reign In Blood of course. War at the Warfield is a good Slayer DVD, but Still Reigning is superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!!!!!","review":"Great dvd. slayer at their best,great 5.1 sound and the concert is raw from start to finish, straight to the point slayer!!!!!!!!! a must buy!!!!!also the camera stays on the band and doesnt veer to the fans which is a plus, and a must buy!!!!!!!!!ps,just dont buy the new \\"rush live in rio dvd\\" all fans, no band, it sucks ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"great concert, BUT","review":"the concert was great, with a great setlist.

In my quest to order the Meritline inserts I went directly to the Meritline website to order the product; however, they were out of stock (backordered) of these specific inserts. Thus I went to Amazon to complete my purchase. Not sure how well they work, yet. I am surpised that Amazon allows such sneaky tactics by the vendors they host.

Second the baskets and press dont fit snugly so a lot of the garlic just came up the sides making a big mess. Finally cleaning is simply not that easy as your balancing little pieces and still need to clean the main unit since the garlic smeared all over the sides. To me a good garlic press lets you load it with 3+ plus cloves, press, get a tbsp+ of garlic, use an attached cleaner to push out the skin, run it under water and hang it to dry, your fingers stay clean, your garlic is pressed and your meal is tasty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double the handles, double the fun!","review":"I love this!

I hope others have a chance to see the film the material comes from. I cannot say that (and the logical thing would be to consider this a souvenir of having viewed the film), but this was truly a valuable disc to have because it is Nena singing a lovely song. First the \\"radio version\\" (which is with strings and a little bit of rhythm accompaniment. Then an acoustic accompaniment. An accompaniment with strings in a \\"classical\\" version.

This mess was a huge nosedive from the previous storyDoctor Who: Horror of Fang Rock (Story 92). This was the beginning of the Graham Williams years as producer and it shows.

The story also became quite preachy at times.I wouldn't recommend this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought provoking, but hard to swallow...","review":"Unlike the review that Modern Berean gave, I don't think the book was total trash. It does indeed make a person go, \\"What?\\" a lot of the time, but, there are some definite truths to what Mr. Smith wrote.It did take me a while to warm up to his writing style. I'm sure that has to do with the fact that he's a lawyer. Its also difficult to understand exactly what he personally believes.His attempt to give an overview of Christianity for non-believers and believers both, leaves you scracthing your head at some of his conclusions. While I agree with him that we (as Christians) should take a HUGE step back from our belief systems and take a fresh look at the Jesus we think we know, I'm not sure that abandoning whole parts of the Bible is how to begin.All in all, I wouldn't recommend buying the book.

Were one to this book in conjunction with another, the arguments of which were equally biased yet well stated, one might have a decent basis on which to form an opinion. A good example of a similar pairing might be to read Lenore Terr's \\"Unchained Memories: True Stories of Traumatic Memories, Lost and Found\\" along with Elizabeth Loftus' \\"The Myth of Repressed Memory.\\" Neither are quite as unbalanced as this particular work but perhaps this may lend them more credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chillzanne Bowl Not Worth the Money!","review":"I bought my bowl a few years ago.

I went with this over the new Logitech remotes based simply on price and battery life. (Reviews of Logitech say battery life is as little as 12 days, and this model is available for less than $90 with free shipping on the net).It is true that it has cons: buttons are not backlit, it is large, etc... but it works awesome.

I am extremely pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after three months","review":"This remote worked fine until shortly after three months from purchase.

I found the advice in the book regarding cultural mores and appropriate behavior to be invaluable. The descriptions of places, restaurants, and hotels was accurate. I would have liked to see longer lists of accommodations. One thing I learned in Nepal is there are many, many more hotels than this book describes.Here's why I gave it a 4: if you are over 40, go out and buy reading glasses before purchasing this book.

It has a spooky setting that will leave you wishing you hadn't read it at night, but it's so good, you just can't resist the temptation. Carolyn is a sweet, innocent girl who is interested in the romantic stranger Joss. But is Joss all he seems to be? And what is the real story behind the murderous pirates. Carolyn must find out before it is too late. The ending will surprise anyone. I couldn't put it down and read it in one day.

The only think I had a problem with was the whole \\"ghost\\" story being told, and told, and told throught the book. I was kind of getting bored reading about the captain and his wife. Although the story about Carolyn and Joss were good, I was rooting for them! The end for me was semi-predictable...I knew some of it, but was totally thrown for the other half!

I have meticulously compared this CD with the original ones on my super-stereo that I built myself and that reveals every detail, and on my electrostatic headphones. Only to come to the undoubted conclusion that this so called remaster is a scam! No wonder, it is from a completely obscure label Acadia/Evangeline.DO NOT BUY THIS!!

Tres cool. Thomas Fehlmann's mix is slower and more in the spirit of the original. Again, this is good. Soul Catcher's remix is faster and trancier, but not dark like Kris n Dave. It's more upbeat and stuff. It would probably satisfy the PLUR-spewing raver kiddies.Order this now. It's great.

There isn't a single visual that shows you the scale/lick patterns used for the performances and the accent of the instructor is hard to follow at times.

The battery compartment on the remote control did not stay closed (there was a rattle inside - probably a small internal piece had broken off). We taped the batteries in and thought we'd still give it a try. Unfortunately, the car did not operate correctly. It would move a few inches and then stall out and not move at all, regardless of how we moved the remote control levers. When it would move, it only made left turns. Not a lot of fun.

It gets stuck fairly easily. It does float in water, but it is very hard to steer while in the water or even make it move. Be prepared and have something ready to fish it out of the water because it will not be able to climb out of anything by itself.The remote control is also hard to operate for small children. I was looking for something that my 4-year-old niece would be able to operate, but the way the controls are set up makes it hard to learn how to control it.
