The exercises offer a full range of motion and yes you can feel the burn afterwards. I have fibro, so I must be careful and I can't do anything too strenuous when I'm in a flare. That's where the height adjustment is so great...adjust it to what you can handle on any given day. This fits the bill perfectly. And as others have said, it's fun!

It does a great job of firming and toning your muscles. It is easy to use and the instructions are easy to follow for any level. The downfall is that it takes up alot of space and you are getting on and off to change levels and parts. The holes are hard to find with the pins.

How can you beat the price! It is perfect for beginners and intermediate workout plans. You will not get big and bulky from this machine, but you will tone up and fast. The number of excercises seem limitless. The fact of the matter is, this machine is way more fun than lifting weights and it does not get boring. Also, one of the main reasons I bought this machine is that you don't need a spotter as you would with heavy free weights.The initial set up for this machine is pretty easy. Transitioning between excercises is equally as easy. All in all it's a great addition to my workout plan. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This is a great product for the money. It's a very basic exercise machine, easy to set up - my son had it together in under an hour with minimal effort. It's easy to use, and if you use it on a regular basis you really do see changes. I think it's great for a beginner. For me it's easier to find a position and just leave it there for a while - constantly repositioning the pegs and sliding things up and down all the time isn't difficult, but it gets wearisome after a while. It's really no more difficult to use than going to the Y and using the weight room there. Except that I know who was the last person to use it! LOL It is a little longer than I expected, but just by a few inches. I would probably not be folding it and unfolding it all the time and storing it under a bed - that would be totally unweildy.

My favorite is the blower. One of the reviewers commented that the blower was more like a toy - I totally disagree. I have fall leaves that are everywhere - deck, carport, front yard, back yard, long winding driveway....it used to take me hours to rake and sweep. It now takes me 30 minutes to do it all.I have no problem with the batteries. They last long enough for what I need to do - and if one is wearing down, I plug that one back in and grab another one to finish the job.The hedge trimmer and weed whacker are great as well. Again, what used to take me half a Saturday has been reduced to less than 2 hours. The cordless capability is absolutely fantastic - no cords or gas - and the noise level is not even an issue. The tools are lightweight and extremely easy to use.This lawncare center is one of the best deals out there. I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I purchased this set under the recommendations of many of previous purchasers, and I regret it.

The weedeater gets tired after 3 minutes, and the hedger has a tough time with 1/8\\" branches. I do admit the blower is OK, and quiet, but that cannot make up for the other 2 items in this package. I am a new homeowner, and so far what I've learned in my first year...you get what you pay for... BUY QUALITY and you will be satisfied for years. Try to pinch pennies, and you'll regret it, and end up spending more for the top quality equipment later. And if you need power...electric can't do it, you gotta go gas.

The first set is over 10 years old and is still working but the hedge trimmer is getting dull. I tried to replace the blade but don't think they make a replacement (if they do, I couldn't find it). I then was going to just replace the hedge trimmer but since the weed whacker is used extensively and would probably need replacing soon, it made more sense to buy the set again and in so doing, get 3 new batteries and a spare charger too! I could no longer find the set in the stores and was thrilled to find it online. The fact that I don't have to mess with an extension cord or kill myself trying to start a gas model is a real plus!If I had a complaint, it would be concerning the leaf blower which works OK on hard surfaces (garage floor and driveway) but is definately not powerful enough for removing leaves from the lawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"I bought this cordless set along with a B&G; cordless mower. As with the mower, the set is very convenient. It is only for light work. I find that the batteries do not last long. Luckily, the set includes a battery for each tool. Since I do not use all 3 tools at any one time, I can finish a job by switching out the battery.If you need tools for light work, get it. If you are looking at heavy or frequent work, you are better served getting something else. I got what I expected and am pleased with the purchase, but I do wish the batteries would maintain power a little bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice yard tools, battery life could be better","review":"These are nice tools for maintaining a small yard. I like having the automatic feed in the trimmer; no worrying about string length and bump and go. It gives you the ability to do standard weed eating and edging, which is nice. The blower is handy for moving grass clippings off the sidewalk or cleaning out the garage. It's not a leaf blower, though... so don't expect a tremendous amount of power. I haven't used the hedge cutter.The only gripe I'd have is that the battery life isn't great. Another reviewer said a pack lasted about 7 minutes. That seems right to me. After having my packs for a year, they're losing capacity... and will probably need to be replaced after year two. These are NiCd (not NiMh) packs, so they already had that built-in disadvantage.Anyway, love the tools - and hope they make better batteries for them in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"The edger and hedgehog work awesome...the battery lasts on these.

By the time I am through doing 2-3 hours worth of yard work with this equipment, it will have taken me 5 days. I used both batteries to trim 1/2 of my backyard and the batteries had to go back to the charger. The second day, I used both batteries to do the second 1/2 of my backyard. The third day, it took both batteries to do my entire front yard, which is really small. I'm certain it will take both batteries to trim my hedges tonight and then I will be back at it tomorrow to blow off my drive and walkway. So far, everything works great when there is a new, full charge; however, that will last only about 15-20 minutes per fully-charged battery. REALLY BAD PURCHASE considering it should take only a couple hours out of ONE day per week to perform ALL yardwork at my home.If I find I just have bad batteries and I am able to get my yard work down to 1 day, I will be glad to amend my review and publish my findings."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dream Come True","review":"We have acquired this system piecemeal. I would also recommend the 24 volt weedeater unless you have a postage stamp yard. I applaud Black and Decker for figuring this one out. First, they are light and easy to handle. With all of the batteries (I have 4) there is always enough juice. Second, as a woman I needed something I could handle. My husband is thrilled as he finds the driveway blown off, the hedges trimmed and I've yet to sink my teeth into the weedeater but we trimmed all the area around our small orchard of 10 trees on one battery.

Plus the blower is a total waste, as it clearly states its not a leaf blower, but I found myself having a much easier time sweeping my garage than kicking up all this dirt/dust with the blower.

This should have come with 3 batteries, however luckily my brother had an extra battery which he gave us so we do have 3 batteries now. Love the blower which we bought to keep our new deck, the walks around our house and driveway clean. It's easy for me to use as I can't use our power blower with my pacemaker.

I'm sure for a large yard, it might be differently, but for mine, it is perfect.- The string trimmer works great, even use it to do simple edging around the lawn.- The blower is great to blow the grass clipping and other stuff. It's not super-powerful, but pwoerful enough to play almost anything...even moves small rocks.- The hedge-trimmer works pretty good too.

The lawn trimmer is good but not great. Most of the times it handles very well but once the battery runs low the lack in power makes the job a lot harder. Since I have a small yard this isn't a worry. I usually swap out a battery every time I edge and this leaves more than enough power to get the job done.

My arms were killing me when I was done from holding it in one spot while watching it slowly chew through patches of grass and then moving on to the next spot of gras, it is actually a good work out.

Easy to put together.Weed trimmer works great, even on thick grass, just a little slower and it works better for edging than my old gas trimmer. Would have been 5 stars except it takes 2 full batteries to do a typical \\"larger\\" front and back family yard. having 3 batteries was a BIG selling point for me, as I can do Edging one day, then blow away the trimmings and Hedge the next day.Blower works good, not as powerfull as our electric, but adequate for the job.Hedge trimmer works very well and 1 battery lasts long enough to complete all the hedges in front of the house.For the $ you can't beat this set. Very Light and Easy to handle everything. My only complaint is the lack of battery run time with weed trimmer and also the blower.I think as long as I don't let the yard work go too long, battery run time will work OK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what in product description","review":"I gave one star to this product for two reasons. First - battery life. Brand new, fully charged battery can't hold charge even for 10 min. Second, whatever is advertised on amazon.com and what some people claim in their reviews is not what I received. This package came with only two batteries and dual charger unit and not three as was stated in the product description. Even the manufacturer box itself shows only two batteries. I don't know if this this recent change or not, but paying for three pieces with two barely working batteries is not what I expected. Would not recommend this product to anyone. I would have returned it back, but I've already used it once only to find out that it was not worth the money and all the good reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Batteries kill a great product","review":"I've had these tools for a year now and I have already had to buy four more replacement batteries.

It came with 3 batteries and a 3 slot charger for $199. On 8/1210 I bought the same CCC3000 for $199 from Amazon, but now it has only 2 batteries & charger. I called \\" Matt \\" at B & D who said his notes said there should be 3 batteries I faxed him my receipt, but have heard nothing. Apparently this is how they make money, by ripping off buyers. I have purchased many B & D products in the past, but this the last !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was very excited to have found a cordless weed wacker since I am not strong enough to keep starting the gas powered one and I have too far to go to use the corded one. However, when I started using it the power was obviously sub standard. It took several swipes to wack a spot where the electric one had it to the ground in one swipe. Also the darn brand new, fully charged battery lasted less than 15 minutes! I would never recomened this to anyone who had more than a side walk trimming to do of less than 10 feet. This is the worst purchase I have ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY Light Duty/Not a suitable edger","review":"Had this set for 2-3 months now. The hedge trimmer is fine, 4 stars. But the weed wacker and blower are pretty weak - I wish I had more powerful tools. DO NOT plan on using the weed wacker for edging (when you flip it) unless you are either 5'1\\" or your back likes to bend over. Granted my house had not been edged in a while, but it goes through a battery in about 10 minutes. No problems with mailboxes or around light posts...it can handle the light stuff. The blower is about the same, 10 minutes and battery is gone. Granted I have a bigger corner lot, but expected these to handle my 1/2 acre needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short sell","review":"My 3 garden tools just got here whith only TWO batteries. The photo shows all three with batteries as well as some of the reviews but the NEW discription only says it comes with two.When I tried to order two weeks ago it did say that it came with 3.The 199.00 price is not not the value I was looking for.Greg"},{"rating":"1","title":"short battery life, broken weed wacker","review":"Extremely short batter life. Used with weed wacker and the battery (after being charged over night) dies in just 5 minutes.Weedwacker is not cutting the excessive string and now it constantly gets tangled. Very annoying.At least the hedge trimmer works great. Blower will only work on a paved or smooth surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built in Obsolescence","review":"Bought all 3 tools, storage unit & 3 batts for $200 or so. I was initially satisfied with the tradeoff - convenience and weight vs. power and endurance, but like all tools, time has been the true test. The 18v batteries are supposed to last 150-200 charges, but all 3 batteries died in less than 50 each (and probably closer to 40 charges). Replacement batteries are expensive and would only compound the unit cost (good money after bad). Even though I'm used to Craftsman tools being handed down across generations, I had realistic expectations for portable lawn tools. Even so, this purchase still fell short against minimal standards of quality. In 30 years as a homeowner, this was the worst tool I ever purchased, (but it IS convenient). Be prepared for built in obsolescence and needless replacement costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good products","review":"All three work fine. No where near as powerful as plug-in tools but they work as advertised. I am glad to see that Black & Decker did include an LED light on each charger, unlike our older Dust Buster.The Blower is good enough to clean grass off of the sidewalk. Some other reviews said that it was not powerful enough, but considering no gas and no plug-in, it works fine for me. The weed wacker is about half the speed of a plug-in unit. The hedge trimmer works with quarter inch branches and weeds, perhaps as fast as a plug-in. Having the same battery work on all three tools is a big plus.Most battery tools have the newer and higher capacity NiMh batteries, but B & D sticks with the lower cost Nicad batteries. You will totally run down at least one battery when using these tools.I think the package at the discounted price is well worth the money, but I would not pay full retail price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain if you are starting out","review":"OK. Bottom line, this is a great deal. I just bought my house and needed all the tools to go with it. Every thing worked as advertised. I trimmed and edged, then trimmed the hedges and \\"swept\\" up the mess with one battery. I agree the blower is not that powerful but it is not a leaf blower, but a sweeper. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Set of Tools","review":"This set is surprising good. All are very light and easy to use. It should be noted that the edging feature of the trimmer is good for maintaining a nice edge to sidewalks and the like but you may have to borrow your neighbor's gas edger to create the edge (groove) to begin with. Also, you have three batteries so unless you use all of the tools equally, you can always swap out if you run out of juice."},{"rating":"2","title":"impressive product","review":"I just got this product and used all 3 tools in the package. The most impressive tool is the trimmer. This trimmer just ROCKS. The motor is powerful; the trim line is auto-fed!! I can do both edging (bed not sidewalk) and trimming in my yard. I just love the trimmer so much that I weeded my neighbor's yard too. Cordless just rocks. I have a corded one and i just WOULD NOT go back to it. The trimmer does drain a lot of power. I used up all 3 batteries in an hour.The hedger is nice too. Not as powerful as i would like it to be but good enough.The blower is not bad. Again not as powerful as the corded one i have.Overall, I still lover all 3 tools just b/c they are CORDLESS. So I highly recommended this product over any other. No cord and no exhaust!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Very Impressed!","review":"I wasn't sure at first about the battery powered hand tools but they are light weight and easy enough for me to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tools are ok and can handle the work but battery is WEAK","review":"I bought these tools a month back and can state that tools can handle the work on 0.25 acre yard, but i never was able to complete the work within the same day because all 3 batteries go out of charge with in 30-45 min.I wish the betteries were better :(I still thinking if i should return the tools or keep them. If I find alternative on the market with better battery life I'd return these tools and buy another ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Love the trimmer and blower. They both do an excellent job. Haven't had to use the hedger yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough power, battery life","review":"I just wanted to add my voice to those who felt that the battery life was insufficient. After moving into a new home and using this set to catch up on a significant amount of neglected landscaping, we just felt that it didn't cut it. We were swapping out the battery every 40 minutes or so (the saving grace was that there were 3 of them, so there was always another one ready to go--so long as you were using one machine at a time). Also, I felt that the hedge-clipper and the blower were fairly weak at their intended purposes. The hedge trimmer kept stalling and getting caught on the hedges. The blower blows grass around--do not even think about using it on leaves. I cannot speak for the weedwacker, as I was disappointed enough to return the set without even bothering to test it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yard work made easy!","review":"I love 'em! I got so tired of trying to get the gas hedge trimmer started I wanted to scream. Then the darn gas lines cracked on the weed whacker I'd had enough. After doing some research, I discovered the line of lawn tools by Black and Decker. I have used their cordless drills and sanders for years now so it was a natural progression. The power center has made it so easy. I even use it to charge my drill battery packs. If the battery goes low, grab another and keep going. I now trim and clean up with my weekly mow and my yard looks great. It sure beats pulling cords and $4 a gallon gas!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate","review":"The weed-eater trimmer is adequate, but the blower is underpowered. I'd suggest purchasing only weed-eater if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, worth the price","review":"Great tools from Black and Decker, a good price combining all three items together. We use each of these tool and they work well into their second season of use. They look good and store well and are effective tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"need more batteries","review":"received the package few days ago and used it once so far, the trimmer / edger and the blower. the trimmer / edger are very easy to use and powerful enough for some tall grass. the blower is quite powerful as well. haven't used the hedger yet.the only downside is that it comes with only TWO (2) batteries. the product description above gives conflicting numbers. the top portion said it has TWO (2) batteries, but the bottom says it has THREE (3) batteries.I have a corner lot and long side walks, the two batteries were not quite enough for both trim and edge. i had to wait for half an hour so that i could finish the edges and use the blower to blow the clippings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Definately a good product. Saves time and hassle not dealing with cords. Products are well made and will probably last for years to come. Blower strength definately weaker then its \\"corded\\" sibling (I've used both now), but the convenience is worth it. I'll have to wait-n-see on the batteries. The specs say they won't get a \\"memory\\", but I've had bad experience with re-chargeable products. If they work as advertised, I might have to bump up my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Trio!","review":"This threesome is EXACTLY what I was hoping for! I had purchased a \\"Power Glide\\" set, available through Ace Hardware, a couple years ago, but the batteries would not stay charged for long, and the chargers burned up easily. But, I got the \\"bug\\" for having cordless tools that could travel over my one acre, without having to lug a cord along, or to smell like gasoline! These Black & Decker tools have powerful batteries that last through most jobs, but the advantage is, there are 3 batteries that are interchangeable! Odds are, you won't be using all 3 tools extensively at one time! I like having the blower handy, in the house, for quick cleanups outside the front and back doors! I love 'em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap qualities","review":"I've had this set for about 6 months since we moved to our new house. The batteries now die in about 10 minutes. And of course 3 batteries give a run time of about 30 min. Which is still not enough to finish the job.The battery run time keeps getting shorter and shorter. I am not happy with this at all, I wish I could return them and get the gas ones instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"b-d batterys suck","review":"I bought this set based on the reviews.They are just plain under powered.The batteries are very cheap and short lived.Did you notice the new litium tools dont interchange batteries because they are 20 volt? This company is not the old black and decker.Dont buy these tools !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best tool set ever","review":"this is not a heavy duty set but if you know what your getting it is perfect and I love it. The three batteries allow for about a good 1.5 hours of use depending on the tool. The blower uses the battery power the fastest. The power of the weedwacker is deceiving near that of a much heavier gas powered edger. But the best of the lot is the hedger ultra sharp blades help the efficiency of this tool but one battery can slice through numerous shrubs and bushes and this gardening task has never been easier. No more slicing electric cords for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second set","review":"I bought one for myself 2 summers ago, Liked it enough to buy one for my son-in-law for their new home as a housewarming gift.

After several uses of all 3 of these products I can now say they work great. My lawn is about 1/2 an acre with a fence to trim around, and quite a bit of edging.

In this game, you can do the same thing, however instead of Bullet time as in Max Payne, in this game, it's called Tequila Time. Also, while in Tequila Time, you can jump over tables, etc, but it gets really annoying when doing so, b/c the character in the game makes this really irritating sound, like he's dying or what you. I just could not see what the big deal about this game was. Another blatant rip off of this Game was, in Max Payne, towards the end, you have to fight a helicopter in Nichole Horne's building. In Stranglehold, you do the same thing-different setting, but still, same idea.

My children soon became frustrated and gave up. I have taken it out over the last two years several times trying to get them interested and they always start off excited and end frustrated.

I don't know if the other reviewers here were lavishing praise over something that they heard was supposed to be so good, but knowing this going in and thus prepared to love it I found myself thinking, if I didn't know this was supposed to be good I would be thinking it was terrible, and therefore I thought it was ... fine. Certainly not a classic. Mildly amusing. Not at all memorable. Perhaps it was significant re historical era in which it appeared and its place re Spanish politics etc. etc. but I wouldn't know. Standing alone, it was nothing at all special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildly funny","review":"Love, sweet love, what some people will go through in the name of love! In this fleet-footed comedy a woman (played by Carmen Maura) learns that she is pregnant by her married lover (Fernando Guillen) and spends two frantic days and nights trying to contact him with the news. This sets off a madcap series of \\"adventures\\" - each one enough to cause anyone a nervous breakdown - involving Shiite terrorists, her lover's wife and son, the police, and a mad chase to the airport. At the end Maura saves Guillen's life (his crazy wife was going to shoot him) but decides to throw him over.The camera technique here is flawless: with quick cutting and constant movement we feel Maura's anxiety. The maddening missed connections are handled brilliantly. Writer and director Almodovar has a sure comic touch. This movie reminded me quite a bit of A FISH CALLED WANDA, which also has madcap humor and a very fast pace. Both pictures even have a stutterer in them. Definitely worth a watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must disagree...","review":"with the other reviews. I bought the DVD based on the glowing superlatives I read here, and was totally disappointed.

I think this book should be read, however, by Protestants and Catholics alike, just as I have read Protestant material on similar subjects.C.S. Lewis is admired by many Christians including myself, but it is interesting to see, as a high-church Anglican, why and where he drew the line between his religon and that of Roman Catholics. Looking at his literary work and that of his close friends (including J.R.R. Tolkien, the staunch Catholic), Pearce carefully and honestly examines Lewis' beleifs and clarifies his positions.It is interesting to see how Lewis really was just a breath away from Catholic beleif, but how very important that breath is.This book is well-researched and quite enlightening. I enjoyed it and will ceratinly be reading more of Mr. Pearce's work in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"C.S. Lewis and the Catholic Church","review":"Amazing book. I loved reading this, it was an education on why C.S. never made the jump and Joseph Pearce provided the final answer with terrific writing!This book provided an incredible exposure on Lewis's life,relationships,education,upbringing, and his passions with the best that his biographers had to offer on his account, which is all included and footnoted.C.S.Lewis was a great writer but a lot went into the movement of his pen.I wanted to know what that was so this was the book which settled that hunger for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dracula and Frankenstein Are Friends","review":"I am a school librarian.

I tried to bathe a horse by using the long tooth curry attachment and had a hard time moving it through the long coat. It would be easier if the attachment could rotate. I found the whole thing awkward to use. I'll try it again when they shed out.My horse now has a summer coat and this curry is awkward to use. It also goes through a lot of shampoo.

We may never know who these people were, but that they were there is hard to argue. I enjoyed his little vignettes of imagined life at the time, and especially his rather epic-echoing compound words (\\"first-footers,\\" for example). For anyone whose attention was caught by the ice facts in \\"Smilla's Sense of Snow,\\" or the thrills and chills of Heaney's new translation of \\"Beowulf,\\" this is the next book for you.

The mists of time have cleared just a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intensely depressing","review":"The author, a fine scholar and archeologist, is a bit verbose. He delves into the minute details of the lives of every tribe he mentions. So, the book needs editing. However, it is clear by the time you are a quarter through the book that this is a very important and interesting theme for our time. The descriptions of the ways and means humans have behaved is nauseating. The massive numbers of animals and humans our ancestors have dealt a painful death are horrifying.Read this book if you want to be depressed, and want to see how humans behaved before, oh say fifty years ago.

If you already write a lot I would suggest not to spend the money. I write for a band that's been around for a while and figured I would try to spice some things up. The only things that seemed to be of any use to me were just reaffirmations of things that we all know. Having been written in the 80's the content is not very current. Essentially, this book could be condensed into the following ideas: Have a strong control of language and vocabulary, REALLY know who/what you are writing about, Don't write poetry and expect people to connect, Have a strong lyric you build around.If you are planning to just start writing lyrics... it's a good book.

Yeah, good luck with that. For the those of us who are more interested in getting ideas and guidance on writing songs that we want to perform and record ourselves, the book is less useful. Sure, it does contain useful information on form, rhyme etc., but it is all very pop-oriented.

It is a bit of a primer, so it will probably not appeal to old M&A; hands; however, any MBA can tell you about discounted cash flow analysis, but few CEOs have mastered the art and science of integration, which is the focus of this book.The glamor is in the deal making: late nights with the lawyers and bankers. But most (most!) mergers fail to yield their expected value because the unglamorous job of integration is largely ignored during the deal and often mishandled afterwards.Schweiger's theme is that integration is paramount to ultimate success and it must begin at or before valuation and due diligence, and it must be integrally woven into every step and every process.The book is readable, logically organized and helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam always has great live performances but this one...","review":"Pearl Jam always has great live performances but this one...really is awesome.

Very few templates that were near impossible to make anything useful from, and a struggle to figure out how to do even that. After purchasing this one, I remembered another Magix product I purchased years ago, and it was a piece of trash too.

Like so many others I fell for it. This is not a website creating software, it's a scam to get you to buy webhosting with a subdomain. Sometimes it loads very slow, but that's not all, if it loads, it comes with all kinds of mistakes making the layout unreadable. Stay clear from it, just like all other software from Magix. It's incredible that people are still trying to pull scam off the internet when it's not that complicated to be honest. Well, I'm mad and I should be. We should be passing laws making it possible for the return and refund of scam softwares like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"SWING-A-DING-DING!","review":"Yeah, baby, YEAH! Man oh man, this platter delivers, and then some. The arrangements swing to high heaven, as does the chairman of the board, at full voice and at his peak. Vintage Sinatra in every way, on a par with \\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers\\" and \\"Nice and Easy\\". Makes me want to swill a double martini (very dry with two olives), and, if I didn't loathe the vile things so much, smoke a pack of cigarettes or two (but then I'd start coughing and stink up the whole house, so no deal on the cigs, baby.)Anyhoo, this recording is a must, but only if you love classic American pop music at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ring A Ding - Ding","review":"There will never be another Francis Albert Sinatra.don't get me wrong there are good singers out there,but as they say there's only one Frank Sinatra.I rate this CD a 5 of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Mandel's helper, Dick Reynolds","review":"As strong a record as this CD is for all the reasons cited by the other reviewers, the reissue is also valuable in its correct attribution of the arrangement of \\"I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm\\" to Dick Reynolds instead of Johnny Mandel. Or at least valuable to me since Dick was my uncle. The original LP and CD did not have that information. It is thrilling to hear his work sung so well by The Voice with those fabulous musicians backing him up. Dick was better known for work with Ray Anthony and the Four Freshmen, and his multi-harmony work served as one of the inspirations for the Beach Boys and Manhattan Transfer among others. But this one song is my personal favorite enduring souvenir of his craft, and it fits in well at the end of the collection of Mandel's superb arrangements in the rest of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, YES, YES!!!!","review":"What can you say, except that Mandel's sax writing is unique and Frank's in top form. If only Frank had spent the 60's with Mandel and Ogerman (I'd have also paired him with Francy Boland or... Lalo Schifrin) rather than the usual gang, then My Way might have stayed in the bottom drawer and we'd all be celebrating FS for the great jazz performer that he was, rather than the casino belter that he became."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Frank's first and second best (behind September Of My Years) for Reprise. His singing is very inspired and energetic, and the arrangements are outrageously good, probably the best Johnny Mandel ever did. This is the Reprise equivalent of \\"Songs For Swingin Lovers\\". Frank seems to be having a blast with these great arrangements and he sings the songs with a permanent smile on his face. There are no dud songs here, every one's a winner, even \\"The Coffee Song\\"!. \\"In The Still Of The Night\\" and \\"I've Got My Love To Keep Me Warm\\" are standouts. If you want a cd to put on during those special moments with your lover, when you feel like you just want to get up and dance and celebrate your love, this is the one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Sinatra, Masterful Mandell, Curious Packaging","review":"This 1961 session, the Chairman's first for his own company, Reprise, is sterling Sinatra. But you may wish to spend a couple of bucks extra and pick up the 1991 CD version as opposed to this 1998 edition that omits the 3 bonus tracks on that earlier version. Moreover, despite the \\"20-bit digital remastering\\" claim, the sound quality of this more recent recording strikes me as overdoing both the treble end and the stereo separation. To my ears, the 1991 CD version is more natural, more satisfying--perhaps due in part to my memory of the original vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra's only meeting with Johnny Mandel","review":"In his premiere recording for his own label, Reprise, the Chairman of the Board scored a direct hit. From the swinging title tune to end, Sinatra swings as well with Johnny Mandel's arrangements as he did with Riddle's. In fact I'm surprised that they didn't follow with more albums together since in a way, Mandel's charts are jazzier than Riddle's. My pick of the tracks here would be Porter's \\"In the Still of the Night\\" but Frank also reprises \\"A Foggy Day\\" which bears a nice comparison to the Riddle version on Capitol. All in all, a triumph for Old Blue Eyes!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have album for the Sinatraphile","review":"Sinatra's first album with Reprise, with some superior remakes of classics. \\"A Foggy Day\\" rivals or surpasses the Capitol original from Songs for Young Lovers/Swing Easy. \\"The Coffee Song\\" is much more fun than the Columbia original. \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\" finds the Chairman swinging at the right tempo, in the right register and obviously enjoying himself.The Reprise 20-bit remaster is worth buying, even if you must trade your older CD. A personal favourite of this listener, even if several of the Capitol albums are regarded as having loftier status among Sinatra's legendary discography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad remaster.","review":"I bought this cd with great expectation. It was lauded as the best sounding Sinatra album since being re-mastered. I am an audiophile. As a music lover this album represents some of Frank's seminal work. It is a powerhouse of hits! What better to be taken from master tape to the digital domain in modern fashion. Well if this is what the master tape sounds like WHOA! they liked highly exacerbated treble! The cd starts with the title tracks trumpets blairing. And me running for the volume knob. Meanwhile I read forums where this is extolled as a most wonderfull music experience. Maybe I got a bad cd?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK","review":"Unless you just like to waste money, do not buy this book. It was a complete waste of time. I went through every chapter, completed the practice tests, and went into my SAT Literature test feeling confident, and came out wanting to kill myself. In my opinion, there is nothing you can do to study for this test. You are either good at analyzing literature, or you're not. It is impossible to study for this test within a two-month period. Maybe I would've been more successful if I had started studying when I was seven, instead of seventeen."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY COOL!","review":"Great quality poster!

For the aspiring tourist, it would be an entertaining and useful sneak preview of Burkinabe culture; for the consummate sightseer, it would remain a valuable mnemonic on art and life in Burkina Faso. The short running time (thirty-minutes for each film) gives tourists, scholars and viewers in general an overview of Burkinabe culture as well as a comparative experience how three closely related African groups employ traditional performance and art forms in the contemporary sphere. Moreover, it is unobtrusively instructional, a quality associated with most of Christopher Roy's work in the fast growing subgenre of films that truly explore art and life in Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"the real deal","review":"A thoroughly enjoyable saga of danceable latintech-encrusted funk groove.

He dispels common myths promoted about supposedly how \\"bad\\" Cholesterol is.

I even opened it to see the wiring and saw only two wires inside (ground and signal) instead of three (ground plus left and right signal). I checked and found the other signal contact that is not wired. Do not be mislead by incorrect description. The adapter fits OK (with minor problems, you need to force it a little), but will give you a mono sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to see for myself","review":"Wow. This is pretty much a waste of time. I had to see it for myself. I bought this with I Spit on your Grave (which I already have 2 copies of) because I needed to know if the reviews were even close. Well I can now tell you they are spot-on. I have a fairly large dvd collection, and maybe for that alone, its worth owning. But I honestly don't know who I could sell it to even if I wanted to get rid of it. . . Yeah, its that bad...."},{"rating":"1","title":"what","review":"This movie is totally confusing. The plot is pretty easy to follow, no problems there, but you're left confused as to why any of it should be happening and especially who you should be empathizing with(the answer apparently: no one).That was my big problem. I never knew who I should like or hate wholeheartedly. Everyone was always being awful with random moments of shining redemption that made me like them before they rushed off to get back into being awful. Is it wrong to ask that I at least have someone to root for(or entirely against) in a movie? Everyone was hateful and annoying and stupid and then occassionally they'd do something that was beautifully humane but of course it didn't fit. At all.This movie is a mess. I got it in the two-pack with I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, so I'm not as upset as I would be, but yeah. If you ABSOLUTELY must have this movie get it with the two-pack. Otherwise, skip it, skip the two-pack, just get the nice version of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"somebody stop the pain...","review":"Irritating accents, implausible character motivation, and a script that is constantly pulling itself in opposite directions makes the viewer question how Meir Zarchi keeps a clear thought, let alone direct a 90-minute film... That's the feeling I got with \\"Don't Mess With My Sister!\\", a low-budget stinker that's riddled with bad writing, acting, direction, and just about everything else... Okay, Zarchi's previous (and only other) effort, \\"I Spit on Your Grave,\\" was just as confused but more well-done on a technical level than this piece of junk. The exploitation elements are sadly missing (a single nude scene, and action so poorly directed it's laughable) and the film's self-important 'message' (forced marriages will make men snap and sleep with belly dancers!) will leave you groaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER ONE FROM THE DIRECTOR OF \\"I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE\\"","review":"This is a very strange little film that will have glued to the television screen. Some may find it to be a little too off-beat for their tastes, but those folks who loved \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" by the same director will become instant fans of this film. Now I don't believe in giving away too much of the story in a film review so all I'm going to tell you is that this movie is about a very disturbing forced marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compilation, makes me want to get originals","review":"Best of bubblegum, no doubt. Beyond the single super hit (which is fine), my own favorites would be Love Beads and Meditation (aka Love, Peace and Medication) -- absolutely hilarious song, ought to be hit in its own right -- and cover of \\"I was not born to follow\\". Of and Jelly Jungle is great as well.Some of the songs sound pretty much the same (shoeshine boy vs shoemaker for example), somewhat less memorable but not bad per se."},{"rating":"2","title":"More \\"Unbelievable\\" Than The Original US Cut","review":"I'd seen the US cut of Varan several years ago, and it was terrible. Thankfully, Media Blasters brings us the original uncut version, over four decades later. Varan is back in all his glory, last seen in a brief clip in \\"Destroy All Monsters\\" in 1968. Extras include original Japanese trailers, a restored Japanese TV broadcast version, and a featurette on the creation of the Varan suit, all of which are worth a look. I might add, this DVD lacks an English dub, so those who watch dub-only versions may want to avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A QUICK COMMENT OF THE MYRON HEALEY VERSION.","review":"If you're seeing the image of Varan in red letters over a white background that's the Myron Healey version. Let's face it Varan The Unbelievable is not much of a movie, and Varan is not much of a monster. Yes the Japanese version is better, but not by leaps and bounds. It's not like they ruined a masterpiece like the Raymond Burr Godzilla gets unfairly accused of. I'm only glad this was made to keep the Japanese giant monster franchise going. My personal peeve is my dvd was sent in a CD jewel case instead of a standard dvd case."},{"rating":"1","title":"You want the U.S. Crown International Pictures version, NOT this","review":"Look for the much better (and in English) Crown International Pictures version.This version is in Japanese.Look for the better English version on ebay.

But I ended up disappointed. The special effects are pretty decent, for the most part comparable to those in Godzilla (with the notable exception of a laughable scene in which Varan glides like a flying squirrel). But, as another reviewer has noted, the film is just plain boring. The main thing lacking: very little in the way of urban mass destruction. The whole story has a very \\"by the numbers\\" feel to it, with nothing special to distinguish it or its monster."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the uncut Japanese original version","review":"If you're a lover of monster movies, and I sure am, there's nothing quite as enjoyable as finding A JAPANESE MONSTER MOVIE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN!!! And it is so much sweeter when it's a terrific, clean DVD transfer and it's *IN* Japanese without the nightmarish hack-job American dubs so many movies have suffered under for so long. THIS IS A TREASURE! That's the only way to look at it -- a real, true treasure to find such a thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might Have Been Good If It Wasn't Butchered","review":"In case you're wondering, here are the changes made: 20-30 minutes completely cut including Varan flying. New scenes with American actors put in. Main characters changed to Myron Healy and his wife. Akira Ifukube's score cut. Shots of Varan blurred. Poor editing.What seems like a good monster movie is chopped down to a somewhat boring yarn. The monster is cool looking, although he is sluggish. Varan doesn't have much screen time either. This dub most resembles Godzilla, King of the Monsters. The focus shift, inserted American-made scenes, and since the Japanese characters are just nonentities, they didn't even bother dubbing their dialogue. Real cheap... Anyway, get the movie subtitled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Thought This One Would Be on DVD","review":"A U.S. Navy Commander is on the island of Kunish Hiroshima to do anti-saline experiments in a salt water lake. The locals believe that the lake is the home of a monster which they fear and worship. As the experiments proceed, Varan is awakened and goes on a rampage.I recorded \\"Varan the Unbelievable\\" many many years ago from one of the local late shows and pull it out every once in a while when I in the mood for an old Japanese made movie. It is pretty much the remake of Godzilla with some elements of Rodan thrown in.I like these old \\"Godzilla like movies\\" and probably rate them higher than most other would.I never thought this one would ever come out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too many","review":"I've no doubt I'm one of many products of the baby boom who endured this dreadful flick because of fond memories of the original Car 54 series. The series, of course, was no intellectual banquet, but it had charm and fun.This film version's one-joke premise is that Gunther Toody, whose facial expression and manner would make one wonder if those with lower intelligence than Neanderthal man are candidates for the NYPD, cannot keep his hands off his wife. Dreadful bore."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was better.","review":"The movie considered to be the worst movie ever is Ed Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.

This is near the bottom of the barrell as far as it goes. Like others have said, Plan 9 From Outer Space was bad, but at least Ed Wood attempted to make it as good as he could and really thought he did make a good film. There was no attempt in this case.

But after getting right up next to the stage and getting an autographed copy of \\" I Don't Care...\\" I really got into them. This isn't as good as \\"The Gosts That Hanght Me \\" ( I borrwed it from my uncle that night) it still is good. This is more of a Brad album ( His picture is the only one you see in the liner notes) and you can tell the rest of the band didn't have alot to do with it. But all in all this is a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Ain't God Shuffled His Feet...","review":"And that isn't necessarily bad. But this isn't the dummies, with the balanced creative input that energized the Dummies at their best. It's a laid back Brad album, relatively uninspired, with other Dummies playing backup. If you just can't get enough Brad Roberts, buy this album -- but don't buy it to see what new creative heights the band as a whole has achieved."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do care that it's so bad . . .","review":"The other reviewers who have praised this CD must be friends of Brad Roberts or getting some kind of a kick-back, because this pretentious, self-indulgent CD is virtually unlistenable. I have played the first 2 CTD CDs more times than I can count, and found much to like on the third CD, but after listinging to \\"I Don't care . . .\\" I felt insulted. Roberts is just cashing in on the fan loyalty that has built up around the earlier releases to churn out sophomoric riffs and rants. No wonder most of the original band members have fled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Popylupyshoopy","review":"This new CTD album, or should I say Brad Roberts album, is decent. Not as bad as the messy and shallow (yet strangely intriguing) Give Yourself a Hand, but nowhere near as rich and emotionally charged as the first 3 CTD albums (all classics, especially A Worm's Life). My problem with the new Dummies image is. . .WHERE ARE ALL THE STORIES??? The earlier albums always contained Brad's quirky tales about household appliances, Biblical figures, garbage, scabs, ducks, pulling teeth, etc. I'm all for groups reinventing themselves, but these songs are just too cynical and commonplace to warrant multiple listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"What are you talking about?!","review":"This is an incredible album - great lyrics, excellent guitar breaks, another new Dummies sound - a melancholy 'Southern feel that works great, and is a sharp contrast to the funky hard rock of Give Yourself A Hand. Ellen Reid's harmonies are as beautiful as ever, and hear me now you - BRAD ROBERTS IS STILL AND HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CRASH TEST DUMMIES LEAD SINGER. A reviewer 'helpfully pointed out' that CTD had a new lead singer who tried to sound like the old one. Yep, looks like him too. And has the same name! Hey! Wait a second....could it be..? Why not check your cd sleeves before you make absurd claims like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"play it, please ...!!","review":"I'd really like to hear more of American Minor when I'm listening to the radio.

If you want the real deal, check out bands like Split Lip Rayfield, the Bottle Rockets, Kings of Leon, or a band in No Depression magazine.This EP kind of sounds like a bunch of young kids who dress in flannel shirts and listen to way too many John Mellencamp records.

Bob Nelson's latest in the series is little more than a non-stop string of industry stories and reader comments solicited from the web. This book does not aid in taking initiative because the \\"examples\\" are provided without comment or insight into how to apply this more generally; it's far too specific to be of use to anyone else.What remains, including comments from professionals and researchers, has some value but is insignificant for the size of the book.

Some shreds of 'advice' are included, almost seemingly as an afterthought. Save yourself some money and read these kinds of cutesy anecdotes in any number of magazines.A review of 2 or 3 stars may be defendable but the misleading title annoys me to the point where I took stars away because of it.

This might be excusable (it is, after all, an economic treatise) if Melman managed to turn his critique into a map for a society after capitalism but the book never quite seems to get there. There are vague and repetitive references to attempts by workers to \\"disalienate\\" themselves but Melman never explores the workers' efforts with the sort of detail he reserves for outlining the architecture of the Military-Industrial Complex.

I really think he is a genius (well, John Zorn is of the same opinion), but definitively the genius is not present in this record.

You know, the kind of CD they put on in a high-end hi-fi store to show you what that $5000 amp can do.Marc Ribot is great, but this album is too technically perfect for my taste.

Like most Garland efforts, the eight tunes are mix of originals and standards, along with the Miles Davis penned title track. This is a solid session, but Spann's role is a bit minimized, especially on guitar, and Gant's contribution leaves much to be desired.

Shelby was so classy, so likable - I loved how she improved everybody's manners at the Diner. Quinn was one sexy protector and their relationship sizzled! Secondary characters - Brandy, Gary, Uncle Alfred - were amazingly real. I kept imagining Somerton, the brother, to look and act like Niles Crane from Frasier.

Quinn Delaney (ex-cop turned bodygurad) is sent to watch over and protect Shelby, but not interfere with her great adventure. What ensues is a laugh-a-minute good time.

Much of the text quotes from two sources: Ron Goulart's \\"Cheap Thrills\\" and Will Murray's \\"The Secret Kenneth Robeson\\". Ron Goulart is a pulp historian and award-winning SF author; Murray is a long time Doc Savage scholar and author of several Doc Savage books.Since so much of the information in this booklet is drawn from these two sources, I think my money would have been better spent hunting down copies of the Goulart and Murray books, rather than spending my money on this one.In any case, what you get is very skimpy --- 89 pages of very large print and very wide margins, plus a brief bibliography and index.

It was a good set, great music. Not one bad song on the album. There probably are better tour bootlegs availible, but this is a good one, despite the lack of the symbol in the corner that marks the \\"best\\" albums.The show begins with a lively song, and doesn't slow down until Wishlist, and picks itself back up. While the band was obviously tired from the tour during this show, the music was great. The album features a notable performance of Do The Evolution (featured on the Touring Band Video) and a lot of interesting comments by Eddie. The vocals sound a little muffled on the first song, but they seems to clear up as the CD goes on.

The performance is quite vigorous and puts me in mind of Mravinsky's, but without all the coughing. At first I thought the string sound was a little \\"light\\" but I quickly adjusted to it. The sound overall is spacious, but quite detailed. All the small instrumental groupings come out nicely, and there are no annoying noises or musicianly huffing and puffing in evidence. One unexpected aspect of this recording is how much it makes me think that Shostakovich wrote his Tenth in response to Bartok's 'Concerto For Orchestra', so many affinities are there between the two works, (or at least between this recording and Solti's CSO 'Concerto' which I have and can't live without). Who knows? Anyway, this is a terrific CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This is a superb performance full of Shostakovich's very slavic brooding intensity, and properly frenzied and furious in the portrait of Stalin scherzo movement.

To maintain order, she retained Francis Walsingham to organize a network of spies and informers. The organization Walsingham created is the precursor of M15, the OSS and the CIA.2-How did Elizabeth maintain political popularity among her subjects.

This is not a totally comprehensive greatest hits collection as their earlier work (including two charted singles) for Cameo is not here. Notwithstanding that shortcoming and the somewhat meager number of tracks (14), this is the best quality compilation of this material yet.Sound quality is excellent with all tracks except 12 and 13 in true stereo.

There are a couple great songs on it, but most lyrics lack substance while seeming to try to tell you that they are imparting wisdom. Definitely music driven, but NOT lyric driven.

I am a huge fan. There is no doubt that their lyrics are inspired by the Holy Spirit and speak to me every time I hear them...this CD was no different. What a blessing! I especially loved the song \\"East to West\\". Like other Casting Crown albums, this one also has a theme- it calls Christians to get off the fence and chose to walk with Christ. We need to not lose our commitment to follow Christ somewhere between the altar and door. It is truly and inspiration!

Liege Killer is definately a groundbreaking novel. The problem occurs in that he completely changes the backstory (which was excellent) to a half-arsed alien novel, instead of a scientific breakthrough. This discontinuity is similar to the storyline changes between the movies Highlander and Highlander II.I cannot recommend either Paratwa or Ash Ock, as they are very poor sequels to a fantastic novel, solely due to the drastic change in the storyline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book, ending needs closure.","review":"I gave the first book a \\"9,\\" but this book does not get that high a rating.

I don't know how it got so many positive reviews. I was a teacher and school counselor for 30 years and know that kids like to watch DVDs that allow them to follow other kids.

So I'm sure as she reaches the recommended age of 2.5, she'll be able to interact with the whole thing.

I just can't get my daughter to pay attention to it at all, although she likes to watch me do yoga and to mimic me. The adult instructor and plain background do not keep her attention.

Turning the poses into animal names was a fun idea, but not enough to get her to pay attention at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Annoying","review":"I bought this DVD for my 4 & 6 year old daughters and they both completely lost interest.

My kids were bored and I couldn't stand the instructor.

My rambunctious 2.5 year old isn't capable yet of following directions too well with either of them (even with me doing the DVD with him- he gets excited and runs around me while I do this poses lol)but this one doesn't get his attention even for a second. The kids that \\"love, love love\\" this DVD must have been doing yoga since birth. Maybe that is why they love the austerity of it. The other DVD shows kids of various ages doing the poses at their own level, outside at the beach. Its nice to imagine we are a part of that.

It cooks even and leaves lines on the food. It also holds the food higher than the grease that might have dropped off your food. I just spray it with a light coating of Pam and then heat and cook. Clean up is easy because it is a heavy duty non-stick coating that is inside the pan and not just sprayed on. It wipes up with soap and hot water and a wash rag. You can fit 4 hamburger patties on it at one time if you want to do some inside grilling.Calphalon has done it again with great cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked well the first time","review":"I bought this grill pan after ignoring the previous reviews about sticking and difficulty of cleaning. I figured those users just didn't know what they were doing as I own other Calphalon non-stick pans and they all clean up great. Well, not this one. This is VERY sub-par for Calphalon. Food stuck in between the ridges even after soaking overnight. As a last resort, I used the scrubby side of my sponge to try to get it off and wound up REMOVING THE NON-STICK FINISH all around the stuck on food, but the food remains intact. So I now have a spot on the pan where the finish is gone with food stuck in the middle of it. Calphalon has started cranking out lower quality products at cheaper prices in an attempt to reach a larger target market and should no longer be considered high end cookware.

Nothing sticks to it, with just a little cooking spray. It takes a few minutes to fully heat up, but so do other pans. I have not had a problem with cleaning it. I would recommend this pan.

I give it 2 stars, however, because it is quality built.It doesn't seem to conduct heat well, steaming the meat rather than grilling it. And increasing the heat only burns everything. This pan is recommended for ceramic cook-tops, but I haven't found it works well on them because only a fraction of its (rippled) bottom comes in direct contact with the stove's cooking surface.This $50 Calphalon One is greatly inferior to my $15 square grill pan from Italy, which has a round plate on the bottom that comes in full contact with the ceramic burner.

My oldenst after escaping decided to show her appreciation by urinating on her sister who was curled up on the passenger front seat. Thank goodness for Nature's Miracle, but that's another review.

The top of the carrier does not zip completely closed. To close the top you zip both sides and then there is a button to close the other end (your zip the long sides, and button the loose short side). There is an 6 inch section of the top which is closed with a single button. This allows the pet to reach out of the top on either side of the button. once their paw is out they can just push the zipper down and open the top. Luckily my cat has only escaped indoors. I even tried to tie it closed but they still get out. the only thing you can do with this carrier is sew the top closed and only use the side door.DO NOT LEAVE YOUR PET UNATTENDED IN THIS CARRIER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with misleading description","review":"This microphone will not work with a wii.

With Indigo Swing you had great jazz solos and boogie woogie piano and upbeat shuffle rhythms which all made Boyd's slick vocals sould palateble, but here he just sounds like a weak vocied wimp.

Although you know the outcome from the start (her husband is the only man for her), Shapiro's knack for storytelling immerses you in each failed romance. Her honesty also makes this a compelling read, especially when a friend confronts her and tells her that despite all her talk about wanting to get pregnant, she hasn't shown the determination that she would have had it been an all-encompassing need.

It seems disingenuous not to spotlight the fact that this book is largely an imitation (not that High Fidelity is completely original in itself, but at least Hornby took the time to title his book, or shouldn't Lolita really have been titled: The Girl Who Ran Away With Me)---but then again, how much blame can really rest on Shapiro's shoulders for this literary affectation?

As a lucky reader, I was able to mooch off of all of her sessions! Shapiro has had more problems with men than J. Lo, but unlike Ms. Lopez, she's not all uptight about talking to the media about it. That's probably because Shapiro IS the media--a freelance writer, to be precise--and her book reads like one of those great, chatty columns in the back of Sunday magazines that always ends too quickly, forcing you to flip back to the cover story on Donald Rumsfeld. Luckily, \\"Five Men\\" is a whole lotta pages, and how quickly they flew by for me! All of the \\"official\\" reviews provide great summaries, so I won't go there. I will say, however, that this is such a fun, honest, and well-written book. Seriously. I'm really not that enthusiastic a person, I just really liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this what gets published nowadays?","review":"Certainly a readable if not exactly cohesive collection of writings...the author is fast and clever enough with words to keep a reader moving along...but all in all, not much here that hasn't been done better elsewhere. The author's compulsive, relentless personality probably makes her a good journalist but for this reader, that urgent, breathless, tell-all tone doesn't cut it in a book-length work. Plus the book is verbose, and padded (like her bras) with too many details (did we need to know the color of all those Pashmina scarves? or what size shoes she wears?) about food, clothing, music, parties, food, e-mails, and cars.

I could not find ANYONE but Susan Shapiro. This woman has an ego bigger than Lake Michigan. It's all mememememe.No wonder Susan has had such hard luck with men! Her husband must be a saint (or a masochist.) The whole raison d'etre of Shapiro's book is that she was enraged that someone would NOT marry her. She can't figure out why someone would not like her, when really she's just completely self-obsessed.Susan Shapiro should PAY OTHER PEOPLE to listen to (or read) this egomaniacal rant."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your moola...step away from this book!","review":"Ok, in theory this sounds like a great premise for a book. However, I didn't take into consideration the personality of the author which makes so much of this book excrutiating to read.

So, when I saw the Portuguese version of Five Men Who Broke My Heart in a tropical small town nook, I had to grab it and run for my life from the Brasileiras circling around the last few candy-red jackets.Sue's story is universal. It serves to empower those of us who need righting through example; and sends us on a trip in a relationship-Delorian to the core of what went wrong, and what could've been avoided. Sue does her teaching through a hands-on vivisection of her most bumpy landings on love's concourse, and in the process, she opens not only her own black box but ours as well. That's because as soon as you delve into this book, you'll realize, \\"Hey, that's ME in the Wonder Bra!\\" You'll see your mistakes and the snaking paths you could've straightened, or at least know how they went into making who you are now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Stopped Surprising Me","review":"This book really made me laugh. It just kept changing directions on me. I thought it was going to be about the boyfriends, then the narrator, then her family. Shapiro managed to pull off all three in what you realize is a kind of classic movie structure...Act 1, Act 2, Act 3. I guess that makes the book very cinematic -- giving us just enough of each scene then moving on. It's also kind of romantic where you expect it will be mean and full of getting even. And some of these guys are worth a little getting-even with. I couldn't stop laughing at them, though. What do you know, has the women's movement developed a sense of humor? I also read the new Carrie Fisher recently and Five Men was more fun. It reminded me of a book I loved a long time ago, Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen.

When I was on vacation recently in Florida I was reading \\"Five Men\\" by the side of the pool and had to swat away several other women who wanted to get their water-stained hands on it. (I directed them them to Amazon.) Shapiro has such an original voice -- she can be a tough, hard New Yorker one moment and a Michigan softy the next. The books is filled with great one-liners, but by the end she breaks your heart.

Everyone had KMET drawn on every Peechee folder in high school...right next to the tennis player with a joint drawn in, and very close to all the Zeppelin doodlings. KMET blasted from every ghetto blaster on the beach and was the bane of every OCTA bus driver to and from Newport Beach going down Harbor as the kids blasted it from the back of the busses.

Mystery, exotic locales, an ill-fated romance....this book has all the elements of a great thriller. I especially liked Alcott's clever use of foreshadowing.

It was very suspensful. Rosamond is a heroine, to be looked up upon by every female. The only thing that Alcott failed to dictate to readers is Tempest's pure evil. He was a horible person, and various characters tell us that in the story, but without reason. Overall, this book was very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"Gone With The Wind\\" But . . .","review":"I don't do romances. Picking this one up to listen to was out of desperation. After plopping it into my car's tape player, I was treated to a delightfully simple tale with an ending I wasn't expecting.No, it's not a prize winner as some moments seem not very realistic, but it's fun. Don't read to deeply into anything and just enjoy yourself. Heck, I don't think this is any worse than most day time soaps.If you want more character and depth, move along. If you want to get lost in a story for awhile, by all means have a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy (though somewhat fun)","review":"This is, presumably, a melodramatic potboiler that Louisa wrote to pay the bills and then thought better of publishing; too bad it's been revived now, as the utterly shallow characterization, cloying dialogue, and stereotyped plot might give some people the wrong impression of Alcott's skills. However, it can be a fun audiobook to listen to while you are puttering around the house and don't have to listen too closely to it, or it can be a good read for a rainy day. If you like the typical Gothic novel, you may love this book. If you are looking for the fine writing and good cheer of _Little Women_, or the detailed treatment of women's lives in _Work_, or an unconventional heroine (Rosamund is supposedly spirited and unconventional, but in fact she is depressingly shallow and dull), don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE CHASE - FOR JUVENILE MINDS","review":"This book by Louisa Alcott is beautifully written, but with a rather trite, banal and simple-minded plot. It, to me, was almost like a fairy tale, with stereotyped characters - the evil prince-charming and the beautiful princess swept off her feet. Unfortunately, I felt the character development was for juvenile minds - and the tale, also. I found it very difficult to maintain interest in the book due to it's simplicity. Comparing this book to, say, Thomas Hardy's JUDE, THE OBSCURE, one can clearly see that Hardy's book is filled with deep, penetrating philosophy and psychological development of characters, while THE CHASE, is very juvenile and not sophisticated enough to hold one's adult attention. On the whole, I would recommend reading something else. Try Hardy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Louisa May Alcott is known as one of the greatest literary figures of our time. This title is well deserved from her \\"Little Women\\" series, however this particular book was a very dissapointing read to me and other readers I have talked to. It is rumoured that this book was one of her very first novels (I don't know if this is true), and wasn't published until recently. There was proabably a reason for this. It is a very unoriginal story about a girl who is morally perfect, the typical herion during the nineteenth century, who must leave her husband because it turns out he never really married her and was a horribley bad man. So he chases her for awhile and the story ends tragically- typical of a nineteenth century romance novel. Symplistic, stereotypical, and the only really good thing I can say about this book is that it was funny in a quaint, overly dramatic sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and predictable","review":"I eagerly chose the audiocassette version of this book to keep me focussed as I drive long distances in my job. Imagine my disappointment as I listened to Rosamond play into Tempest's hands time and again. I could not believe that Alcott, a truly fine author, had produced such a simplistic story. I was very disappointed at the ending also and just thought the whole thing was a bit too melodramatic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtakingly romantic.","review":"Romance, thrilling adventure, and true, gut-wrenching emotion-- this novel by Louisa May Alcott pushes the envelope. Tempest: a man ruled by passion, cruelty and deceit. Rosamond: a young woman, innocent, beautiful, and strong-willed. Tempest seduces fair Rosamond (and the reader) with his devastating charm, mystery, and dangerous good looks. When Rosamond learns of Tempest's treacherous secrets, she vows to escape from his lies. Unfortunately, Tempest is intrigued and further impassioned by the chase as he promises to win her back, at all costs. Determined to break her wild spirit, Tempest succeeds in alienating Rosamond from others. Despite some slow moments, this book is overflowing with action and excitement. The chase is an interesting one and the ending is thoroughly satisfying"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"I found this book to be fascinating and incredibly intense.

But the pliers were strong for the size and the tool was handy enough.After using it for several weeks/months, the hinges really started to loosen, from squeezing the pliers (ie, using them).

One of the arms started to loosen up and then one day I noticed it had fallen off my keychain and the whole tool was gone forever. I think the tool has a tendency to work itself loose in your pocket.

Her dad encourages the relationship so his daughter will have someone who could take care of her after he is gone. Not long after, the young lieutenant discovers the girl's love for him and also the impossibility of breaking her heart at a time when she is mentally unstable due to her condition and might take her own life. Mixed in all this is the fear of what his fellow lieutenants might think of him dating a paralyzed girl. For me, this novel is was much more than a plain old love story; it is about sacrifice, guilt and, above all, how people are dominated by the expectations of other people and the fear of not being able to blend in society.

Perhaps if Hale had explained or shown why the 80's had had such a lasting effect or used more subtlty in setting up his argument, I would have believed him, but plot and subtlty are definitely secondary to the narrator's opinion that the media denigrated and continues to denigrate the \\"great\\" Reagan unfairly.

This product comes with an instruction manual that is in Chinese only.2. The LCD screen is very dark, making it difficult to see anything on it (i.e. even when set at max. brightness -- it either has no backlight or, if there is one, it is very weak).3. The audible voice pronunciations are very poor and hard to understand (both in Chinese and in English).4. The batteries that came with the product died within only couple of hours of use -- replacement batteries have lasted a couple of weeks, so far (i.e. the product doesn't drain the batteries excessively, but the included baterries are junk).5.

Lane Brainard has a plan and he will win this election, or he will if Judson follows his every command - what to wear, what to say, what to do. It doesn't matter that he is a 12 year old, As Lane states, there are ways around that.This story is equal parts cynicism, optimism and humor mixed together and what comes out is a hilarious story that will make you laugh out loud and hopefully make you think a little more about the political process.

I don't feel that she has any more insight into the life of Laura Bush than anyone else out there. Yes, she does go into meticulous detail in describing certain aspects of Laura Bush's life in Midland, but who most of those descriptions fall into the \\"Who cares?\\" category.

From the beginning chapter to the end she reiterates that at seven-teen she drove her car into another while speeding. I counted six times then stopped. She used words like terrible car accident, manslaughter, killed, and snuffed!

It was probably ripped from a TV broadcast late night cheapie print, with no contrast, wobbly picture, and tinny sound. The packaging has not one word of information about the film, like year, director, or even length. There's not even any identification on the wrap or the disc, apart from a suspicious-looking website and a barcode.

But I think only a lover of Thackeray and/or that by-gone style of writing would have stuck it out. Me, I loved it. Thackeray's last book, and it shows, as his digressions occur on almost every page. Lots of Latin and French phrases, not translated. But the English class system as it was in 1860 is set forth to a tee, as is also their racial prejudice. The portrayal of the marriage of the narrator, who is Philip's friend, was quite marvelously written.However, it must be stated that \\"A Shabby Genteel Story\\" was actually a novella written before \\"The Adventures of Philip\\".

Be patient this system works but for me at least it took these two weeks and not the four days it claims on the package. The reason I gave this four stars is that it can cause some annoying dryness. My neck became very dry and a little chapped after the first week. I simply reduced my application to once a day and put some petroleum jelly on my neck. It feels fine now. Please try this product. It is so affordable and readily available. I used proactive before and was put off by the contractual obligation to reorder. Besides that, it never worked as well as this Neutrogena kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is great!","review":"As an avid Proactiv user, I wasn't sure about trying another brand. However, Proactiv is very pricey and didn't seem to last as long as it should. Therefore, I decided to try this Neutrogena system. I love it! I just have to use about a dime-sized portion of each product for coverage, including the soap, so it seems like it's going to last awhile.I used both lotions at first, but it did really dry out my skin, so I cut back to using one at night and the other in the morning. The past few days I've actually just used one lotion at night and nothing in the morning and my skin still looks good! The only thing I miss is using a toner - I felt with Proactiv that the toner really removed any last traces of makeup. However, I'm getting used to going without that step.This is also a third of the price of Proactiv and came with a coupon for $5 off the next purchase. It's definitely worth trying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"It is too dry, but overall it is good. Because it is too dry, I do not use it sometimes. My acne still comes out. So it is hard to say if it works. Honestly, it is better than other products which has nothing to do with my acne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for adult acne","review":"If anything my acne was worse. I tried to stick with it, with hope, but....I was once told by a Dr to use Neutrogena clear bar or Basis for best results and I was excited to see this product by Neutrogena. I will save my money and go back to the bar. I had as good if not better results and no drying, AND its only $3-$4! I do love Amazon and Amazon subscribe and save, this product not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"I am a 24 year old female with combination skin. I had little to no breakouts during my teenage years, but at 21 I got pregnant and had my son and a whole new set of skin problems! He is now 3 and I still have breakouts. I just began using this product yesterday along with Burts Bees blemish stick. I have tried ProActive in the past but it was too harsh on my skin from the first application. So far I used this system once last night and then again this morning and evening, and I have a feeling I am going to be very satisfied. I will update here as the weeks go one, but so far, I think im going to love this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work...went back to Proactiv","review":"I tried this product as an alternative to Proactiv, which I've been using for about 5 years. I thought it would be more convenient since I can buy this system from the grocery store, instead of ordering online. I used it for about two months, and from the beginning, the acne that had been well-controlled on Proactiv came back. I never saw any relief while using the Neutrogena system. Clears acne in 4 days? I think not! I soon went back to Proactiv, which works perfectly for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Itchy, Bumpy Rash","review":"I started using this product two days ago, and woke up this morning with an itchy, bumpy rash! I had problems with benzyol peroxide 9 years ago, but thought it might be time to try it again, especially with the good reviewds on this product. I truly did notice the acne clearing up in just these two days, so I hate that I have to stop using it! Maybe, like other users, I'll have to use it every other day. If you don't have a problem with benzyol peroxide, this may be your dream product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works as well as the expensive stuff!","review":"We've been shelling out hundreds of dollars for ProActiv for our teenaged daughter for the past couple of years, and all of sudden, it stopped working for her. I did a quick \\"google\\" and Neutrogena products came up. We gave it try. It took about 5 days to see results - then her face was clear! For the price - you can't beat it!11/27/2011: Actually, it doesn't work as well as Proactiv. My daughters face broke out big time. Never happened before. Might have to see a dermatologist now."},{"rating":"2","title":"An affordable find that seems to work well","review":"For the price, I think this works very well. My skin does look much better, though it does dry. Definitely worth a try to see if it will work with your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't recommend this enough","review":"I have combination skin (oily in the T-zone) suffered from acne throughout high school, and enlarged pores since college. I'm in my mid-twenties, and I'm on my fifth set of this system. LOVE IT! For the first time, I no longer have to wear concealer or foundation - my skin is almost completely clear, and my pores are visibly smaller. And I no longer have to powder my nose in the middle of the day.The cleanser can be a little drying with twice a day use, but I find that extra moisturizer really helps to balance that out, and the results are worth it.Also, Amazon's price is significantly cheaper than any store I've come across, so will purchase from here in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"First impression: lots of perfume in the products. Dried the face, gave rough patches on the sides of my cheeks. Got rid of blackheads, but that was all. Did not prevent cystic acne. Got rid of average pimples by drying harshly, and many more returned in its place. I used for 1.5 months before giving up. I'm going back to a less harsh routine, which is probably better for my face anyway. I feel this product made acne worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alright","review":"I use another acne product, but after moving to CA I couldn't find it anywhere. Since I was busy packing and couldn't use the internet to order it online I stopped by my local Target and got the Neutrogena Acne System. There's a cleanser, day lotion, night lotion.The cleanser in the beginning seem pretty good, but after about a month's use it's okay. I probably will go back to my other acne system. I only have mild acne that doesn't break out a lot.The day lotion is useful since it also has 15 SPF. Perfect, since I don't have to apply two types of lotion in the morning rush hour.The night lotion is awkward...it makes your skin all tight and such. Probably the main reason why I won't purchase this system. Neutrogena products are great, but I this acne treatment doesn't do the job for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRODUCT-IT ACTUALLY WORKS","review":"I've been faithfully using this product for the past month, and I can honestly say that my moderate/mild acne has gotten under control. I still break out with a zit or two every other week; which is a lot better than when I was using ProActiv, which was about a couple of blemishes and dry, flaky skin every week! But with most acne products, this system can dry out your skin, so use moisturizer and sunblock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"I recently used this system and experienced immense irritation and drying of my skin. After 2 days of use, even foundation was painful to wear. Then, my skin flaked off in big chunks. I use Neutrogena products such as the On-The-Spot Acne treatment and several moisturizers with no problems. I think that using the 3 products in this system at once can be harmful for sensitive skin.I'm sure for people who don't have sensitive skin, it must work. If you do, try it on just a patch of skin first and not your whole face. The packaging is nice and attractive, so that's why I gave it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"fail","review":"So for the price it's a waste of money. The salycilic acid just doesn't cut it i guess. it's too soft but , then again benzoyl peroxide is too strong. I could get2 or 3 other products here for this price"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I had moderate acne on my chin forehead and nose area. With Neutrogena's background, I though my acne days were over but the whole thing backfired! Day 1 and 2 were nice, my skin seemed to be clearing but the next morning, my entire face was covered in pimples. Hoping this was just the middle phase and that after this terrible ordeal was over, I'd finally have clear skin. But no. It only continued to get worse and worse. This was a terrible product. Now, I'm dreaming of the way my skin was before I started. Complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst thing i've ever put on my face","review":"For me, this was a horrible purchase. I'm 21 and a female. I never had a problem with my skin until I was about 19. I purchased this product when my acne started to get aggressive. THIS MADE MY FACE 100% WORSE! The kit was actually painful (during the first week), it burned! The second step made my face dry and peel. After using the product for almost 2 months I noticed that it GAVE me acne. This product gave me HUGE painful zits.Now I use Clean and Clear Advantage Acne Control Kit (I occasionally buy the mark kit as well). Clean and Clear works so much better. It saved my face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but wear sunscreen!!","review":"I am a swimmer and so my skin is dry when I swim, but then gets oily from all the stuff I put in my hair to keep it looking nice. This causes me to break out around my hair line and all over my forehead. I picked this up at Walmart and found that it worked within a day. However when i went swimming that afternoon i forgot to put on sunscreen( I am really tan so I usually don't wear sunscreen), this caused me to get sun burned only on my face. So if you are going out in the sun even for a little bit wear sunscreen( the lotion with a spf of 15 that comes with this isn't enough!) Other than that I found this product to be excellent it does dry your skin a little but nothing some face moisturizer won't fix i suggest Neutrogena Naturals it wasn't to harsh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, but it will be better if sold individually","review":"I am one of those rare adults that keep having blemishes well in her twenties. I have more break out problems now that when I was a teen. I been using this product for several years and I am really happy with it. I haven't try proactive, so I cannot compare. This system works remarkably well because it cleans the oily skin without drying the rest of my face or making me look all red. I started buying it for my teenager nephew and he likes it too. Specially, because the presentation isn't \\"girly\\" (his words). The only reason that I didn't give 5 stars is that you need to buy the whole kid and I usually finish the creams much faster than the washer. The previous package's washer is almost new and I had to buy a new one to get the creams. Since is not particular expensive I've started using it as a body wash and it has been working really well, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for people with sensitive skin!!!","review":"I have always loved Neutrogena products, so I thought this one would be no different. Boy, was I wrong! After only 2 uses my face, especially my chin and jawline, is completely dried out and itches like crazy. I didn't even realize my skin was sensitive until I used this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best over the counter acne medicine!!","review":"This stuff works great, I have been using for a week and my face is almost cleared up!!

I have oily but sensitive skin and am prone to drying-out from products/severe redness. Because this product is effective at removing oil, it caused some dryness but most importantly it dries out and reduces my acne very rapidly. It is pretty effective at reducing recurring breakouts too, with the exception of the time just before my period. I've used everything under the sun, prescription topical meds and OTCs, even Accutane (caused permanent organ damage and didn't keep my skin clear either). This worked best for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only stuff that keeps my skin clear!","review":"This is the only acne stuff that keeps my skin clear. I had tried so many other products and this finally worked. The only thing is that the benzol peroxide (i think thats what it's called) in step 1 really dries my skin out, especially in the winter months. So, I just switched to using it every other day and it was fine. I definitely recommend this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stuff!","review":"Ever since I discovered this and started using it, my skin has cleared up significantly. I actually get complements on my skin, something that hasn't happened in over 20 years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Improvement","review":"Within one week's time, my acne has significantly decreased. I use the salicylic acid scrub in the morning, and the benzoyl peroxide lotion in the early evening, leaving a thin layer on rather than rinsing it off. This combo has really done the job, and the cost of this product is very reasonable compared to other brands (*cough* proactiv)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dried Out My Skin","review":"I have used this product for a little over two weeks and so far the results have been terrible. I did the entire system and followed the directions exactly yet after every wash my skin was dried out and stripped of it natural oils. I now have dry patches on my cheeks and chin and I still have acne on my forhead. I tought maybe it was the acne control lotiona that was the problem so I reduced my usage but the cleanser is just as bad, after washing my face and putting on moisturizer the dry patches did not subside. Do NOT waste your money, I am a young African American female with combination skin so I suggest for people in the same boat as I am to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"helps clear adult acne","review":"I'm 21 and have been using this product for about 4 days now, I can see significant change in the breakouts that I'm having, my left cheek always have a spot which breaks out more than any other place on my face and It seems that it has reduced this breakout spot by 60-70% which is pretty good.I have no idea how this works over a longer period of time but if the results keep coming as they are at the moment I will be a lifetime customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still got pimples","review":"I bought this product after reading all the great reviews.

I switched from Murad to this product after I continued to break out and was breaking my bank at the same time. I was really skeptical at first, but this works. I rarely have a blemish now and definitely don't break out anymore. It's worth the 20 dollars and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working great","review":"This product is working great for me, it has been about 3 weeks and everything is really clearing up.I am a bit worried about the part where it says to limit exposure to the sun while using this product, it may increase the possibility of sunburn. With spring and summer around the corner we'll see what effect it has for me, I work outdoors, hopefully it won't be an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but it may let your skin too dry","review":"I have been using this product for 3 days, I know it is pretty early to draw conclusions its efficacy, but I have to admit I have been quite impressed with the results. The product reduced the appearance of black heads and my skin is less oily and clearer than before. I have noticed, however, that the night cream leaves my skin dry and red. The cleanser and the day time cream are great. I will probably only use the night cream every other night from now on. The product is well priced and very much worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE moisturizer/product in general.","review":"I'm 16 years old and have been dealing with acne since I was 13, and have tried just about every product. This one was really terrible, I have only used it for 3 days so I'm not sure if it is actually going to clear my acne or not but it has dried out my skin and made it REALLY flaky and the moisturizer is so thin and light weight that it doesn't do a thing. I constantly have a really flaky face all the time now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adult Cystic Acne","review":"This systems works great. I've been struggling for about a year to find something that works. The first week and a half didn't show to much progress and I was breaking out still.

I still have a few small cystic problems about once a month but they are small enough that they aren't a problem.Not sure about the bleaching comments, I haven't noticed that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a bad experience","review":"I used these products for a few days when the skin under my eyes started to burn, turned very red and started to swell. Apparently I got the product too close to my eyes, but I always considered Neutrogena products to be mild.

Aside from redness and burning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this set, due to some negative reviews. However, I am so glad I did.

This product is worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEACH!!!","review":"It RUINED 2 of my favorite shirts before I realized it will bleach your clothes. What happened was I was sweating and the sweat carried the product to my shirts and bleached them. I looked all over each tube and could't find any warning about bleaching. I'm guessing it's the acne control lotion because the active ingredient sounds like it would bleach. Also my eye brows are almost white now.I thought I was saving money until it ruined my 2 favorite shirts which I will never be able to replace and those cost me over 50 dollars. From now on I'll stick to lab series products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Well to start with it didn't arrive for two weeks...

I am still on the origional color toner cartridges and I replaced the black toner about a month ago. The oil roller has been replaced as well as the opc drum. For the price of toner and parts it is cheaper to buy a new printer keep to old one and maybe you will get lucky and a different part that did not break on the first one will go first and you will have the part.

Well, it seems that Windows XP gets a case of indigestion when trying to print to the port which the QMS setup allocates....In short, we would never buy one of these printers again, or any Minolta printer for that matter given the quality of tech service.

Ouch!I just bought my first set of replacement toner (4) cartridges, one of which is still in the box. I'm real sorry that I bought this printer. It managed to print 3,491 pages. Most of them were B&W.I was hoping that this color laser could replace my deskjet and old laser printers, but now its time to dust off that deskjet and see if I can find my old Epson Action Laser 1500 (7+ years old) to keep my small office running.

It uses up supplies at an alarming rate, and toner and parts (all consumable, so warranty does not help) are VERY expensive. Printer is also very slow, and print quality varries from average to poor, especially when it comes to color matching and consistency.Worst of all, after only 8,000 copies my fuser part $$ went out.

Worse than this it offers no warning that the toner or oil roller or drum is about to cease functioning. Thus we have to carry a large stock of consumables. At present I have waited 5 days for an oil roller (weekend & public holiday). The machine is still not operational. There are no local stockists of consumables either. The printer is quite noisy in operation, and depending on the paper tray, where the paper is selected from, is dragging a ghost image from previous print jobs. This I believe could be rectified by myself if I had a spare hour to read the manual. This machine is still under warranty and I only use it if I have to and will replace it as soon as I can afford to.

In fact I don't see how you could even ship this incredibly heavy and bulky piece of equipment for under the $75 amount.The machine is too noisy to leave running all the time, yet it's time-consuming to boot up when you do shut it down.The numerous consumables (cartridges, oil rollers, drums, etc.) all wear out at a fast rate and they are VERY expensive to replace (as other reviewers have noted).Tech support was virtually non-existent.I'll never buy a Minolta product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't move it","review":"This unit worked well out of the box with a little more than I cared for setup.

Also had to replace waster toner 2x and roller once.Printer is lovely when it works, which isn't often..Most of the time it won't print..Gets stuck in energy saver, even with that function turned off, and generally just sits there doing nothing!

It alerts me to replace the black toner. Which cost nearly [money] (due to shipping and tax). If by only replace those four toners, you will spent almost the same price as the new machine with the toners.

On one recent morning near Tucson, when air temperature was around 40 degrees and a light breeze chilled the air, it took about 30 minutes to bring my coffee water to a boil, not more than a 1 quarts.Considering that I could have boiled that water in under 10 minutes with my old Coleman white gas stove, I'm ditching this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a wind shield","review":"This was a gift.

The vocals are smooth and easy on the ears, all-in-all making for a pretty relaxing sound.

It is better than nohing, if stranded, in the wilderness, with no hope of finding a shreds metal to be used as improvised tools. They are shiny though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is not as pictured","review":"I borrowed one of these little tools a friend had and thought it was great. So I ordered several as small gifts for friends. But the items I ordered were NOT the same as my friends.The image is \\"polished stainless steel\\", but mine came as a rough feeling dark grey. Color is not a big deal, but the tools working properly is. My friends swisstech had \\"made in usa\\" stamped on it and even though it was old - was still in perfect working condition.The Swisstech tools are now made in china and they feel like it. Hard to close, when you open it to use as pliers, the \\"arms\\" don't stay in place and make it very hard to use.I am VERY dissapointed.-William Donnell"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure if its 1 star or 5","review":"I was at a yard sale being given by a community-based provider where I purchased a suitcase set where inside I found this tool. I have been using this tool for everything including computer repairs and I cant say enough about it.The only problem is that the tool that I have doesn't match the tool that is being shown here exactly. The one I save is identified as being a \\"Swiss-Tech U.S.A\\". But the markings dont match the one presented. Furthermore, the one I have has a diagonal marking in the center of the rivit \\"LKL\\". The tool that I have in my hand wouldn't fall apart even if one tried. The tool I have also isn't shiny.Maybe what I have is a prototype because in my opinion, the engraving on the one shown here compared to the one I have looks cheep. I will keep mine thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of useless (and missing stuff)","review":"I just returned to Philly after 7 years away and am living in a new (to me) part of the city. I thought this would be a great book to refresh my city savvy. Nope! I learned more in a few days than this book had to offer. In fact, it was missing some really important info. (for example, a great part was left off the map and not mentioned in the text). I say \\"waste of money.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new for companies with a decent web presence.","review":"Unless your website is still being made by your cousin \\"who knows a little about this internet thing\\" there is nothing new for you in this book.Most of what is presented is common sense, heavy on the why but not the how, and very repetitive. Real life examples are limited and center around the finance industry. My search for a resource to inspire designers take usability to the next level continues and this book is being returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter and Cranky","review":"Mordden's other musical history books are so informative and entertaining. This one is angry, bitter, cranky, condescending, and not terribly well written. The book's organization is messy at best, his right-wing politics needlessly intrusive, and his opinion of current musical theatre offensive and closed-minded. In fact, the musial theatre is healthier, more exciting, more inventive than at almost any other time in history. At what other time did we have brilliant experiments like Urinetown, Bat Boy, Songs for a New World, The Last Five Years, Avenue Q, A New Brain, Euphoria, Dream True, A Light in the Piazza, etc.? Mordden is just a fuddy-duddy who can't see what a glorious time this is for the art form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really nice skillet","review":"I'm very happy with this skillet. I'm not sure if the description clearly identifies the lid as being glass. That's a really nice feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calphalon ONE","review":"This pan replaces an older one that was not hard anodized. It's the pan I use the most. Easy cleanup is a plus. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"versatile value that looks good too","review":"i bought this pan less than a month after buying the10-inch griddle. at the time i wasn't sure how much i'd like a pan without a long handle on it, but i absolutely love it. it is quite versatile and has nice heft. (by the way, it works great cooking for two; for more, something larger might work better.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coating easily scratches","review":"I bought this pan about a year ago. 6 months prior, I had also bought a much cheaper Analon pan. Surprisingly, the Analon pan has held up so much better. This calphalon pan has a bunch of scratches. I'm so surprised because I am VERY careful with the pan, only ever using heat-resistant plastic or wooden utensils. And still not a single scratch in the Analon pan. I wipe the pan clean and don't use anything abrasive or even soap.It's too bad because the size and shape is great. I still use it a lot, but I'm disappointed that it sticks more, especially in those crevices. I think I'll go look for an analon pan in this size as a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Inch Size Limited Use","review":"Regarding quality, ease of use and clean up it's everying it claimed to be. I'm very pleased with the purchase. I'm single and so cooking for one I find the 10 inch size to be adequate. However, if it were for a family purchase or cooking for two or more, I would recommend a larger size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I've been collecting Calphalon for over 10 years now. Being a cookware snob I've always stuck with the commercial line (regular, not the non-stick). This is my first non-stick and I love it! I also have the crepe pan (love it too!). What I like the most is that thee handles stay cool to the touch. The glass lid is great and fits some of my older models. I plan to add as Amazon brings out the special introductory priced items (only way to buy this stuff). If you are new to Calphalon and would like to try a really nice pan for a really nice price, this is the way to go!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite pan","review":"As soon as I saw this pan here on Amazon.com, I was hoping it would be my favorite pan........and it is. I've never had an \\"Everyday\\" pan, but it truly is that, and the size and shape are perfect to sit right on my glass-top stove and be out of the way but handy to grab. I've only had it for a couple of weeks, but I'll come back and edit my review after a few months. I use stainless Cuisinart pans for everything else, but a little non-stick skillet is vital for a quick breakfast sandwich, etc., and I'm used to having to replace them (even the expensive ones) every few months. We'll see how this one holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong movie","review":"This is NOT the Reygadas version, but rather a cartoon version of the Sleeping Beauty in Spanish. Will be returning and contacting Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated to put it down","review":"I am utterly fascinated by anything university and anything British. This book was the best of both. Oxford is one of my favorite places to visit in the world. The author is possessed of the requisite sardonic British humour and the information, as well as the entertainment, is nonstop. A must-read if you are at all interested in the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"True classics","review":"What an amazing collection of tales! Seriously, we're talking tiny, lil' stabs at horror from authors as wide-ranging as Washington Irving and Joe R. Landsdale, to Edgar Allan Poe and Richard Laymon, to Ambrose Pierce and Ramsey Campbell, to Mark Twain and Thomas F. Monteleone, to H.P. Lovecraft and Chet Williamson, to Nathaniel Hawthorne and Dennis Etchison, to Charles Dickens and F. Paul Wilson, to Rudyard Kipling and Ed Gorman.This is an absolute must have for both horror fiction fans and horror authors alike. Know the genre, its history and its legacy. One hundred stories you need to read..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate Title","review":"As Arthur Dent would not doubt say, \\"Ah, this is obviously some strange usage of the word 'horror' that I wasn't previously aware of.\\" And the only way this book could cause my hair to raise would be if I were to drop it on my toe."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Just finished forcing myself to read this book only because I can't start and not finish. Boring! There are only about 20 stories worth reading and out of 100 that's just not enough. Most of the stories are cliche and predictable, the title of this book (hair raising) is just plain a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like it!","review":"I really hate to give a low review, because this SHOULD have been one of my favorite books. I love reading about journals and seeing other's journals but just found most everything in here boring. I enjoyed the glimpse at Lynda Barry's pages, but it was all too brief. Danny Gregory's Illustrated Journals book is a much better choice-you get to hear from the artist's and get a good look into their journals. I turn to that book again and again...I only wish that was how I felt about this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"This book features photographs & a couple of sample pages from a select & varied group of people - some are artists, some are other professions. I thought the book would be an inspiration for journaling - I did not find it so. Many of the photo pages are unreadable and uninspiring. Felt it was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, pretty funny","review":"This movie was just about what I was thinking it would be. It was funny throughout but not just hilarious.There is a good bit of profanity along with f-bombs that are presented as \\"f(sound of a ping-pong ball hiting a hard surface)k\\". So I don't know if it is for younger kids. Many of the profanities are hidden but not completely.The story is good and kept me interested. There is a lot of humor though I don't think it is most people's type of humor and I felt like there were some aspects I didn't think were funny but felt like it was intended to be funny.I will probably watch it again sometime. There's a lot of ping-pong in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not finish due to racism","review":"We took it until we just couldn't take it. What funny parts there were in this movie were obliterated by white stereotyping. We couldn't finish it. So tired of seeing the same unimaginative, lazy, fallback theme of making white people (any and all white people) the villain. Especially the way this movie does it casually like its okay. This is a dangerous movie that perpetuates racism against a group of people because they are not the color of another group of people. We work too hard for our money and work very hard being fair to all people to be abused because of the color of our skin by a movie that disguised itself as entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy from this vendor","review":"This particular version of the DVD was not good. The quality was ok but it said, 'Not for sale' or some such wording on the cover and this message continued to pop up here and there throughout the movie as we were viewing it. I have seen the movie before, so I know it's a good movie. It's just that the version this vendor sent me (I picked the least expensive one which should have been a red flag I suppose) I could not recommend by any means."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting, bad ping-pong","review":"A generally horrible experience throughout. The lead character in this film was such an unlikeable, disrespectful, trash-talking punk, we were wishing there was some way that he and the sleazy villain character could both lose in the final showdown. The rest of the cast was humorous and talented, but the plot line of punk reluctantly being pulled into his ethnic heritage only to revert back to punk wasn't particularly creative or amusing. Also the quality of ping-pong by all the \\"playas\\" in the movie was unbelievably inept and fake. Add incessant rap music throughout to make the misery complete. If I didn't like ping-pong, I never could have sat through this dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail.","review":"Racist film. Chinese playing the victim against white oppression. Lots of comments against whites and minorities need to stick together. Bad influence for teen target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect blend of comedy, drama, action ... and ping pong!!","review":"A little (and pretty darned funny) movie with one of the biggest hearts you'll ever find, centering around a Chinese slacker names Christopher 'C-Dub' Wang, who dreams of one day playing pro basketball while otherwise just sleepwalking through life. Lazy at home, unable to hold a job, and with no real goals in life, C-Dub's life changes when a car accident sidelines both his ping pong champion brother, and his mother - who teaches kids ping pong at a local youth center. When C-Dub is forced to take over her ping pong lessons, he bucks every form of responsibility at first ... but eventually gets into working with the kids he teaches, and even starts wondering if he could possibly even defend his brother's titles in the upcoming ping pong championship games. Funny, charming, and with an undeniably lovable lead character in C-Dub (thanks to Jimmy Tsai), this is a sweet, funny \\"Little Engine That Could\\" story that will charm and satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"All red herrings, no meat","review":"It's a cute story with a circuitous trail of red herrings used to reach a different end to a non-mystery story. The writing is good, but the story is Dibdin-lite."},{"rating":"1","title":"REHASH","review":"A great book but only if you own no others on bead or ribbon work. This is NOT new material. It's a compilation of projects from numerous other books by a variety of artists/authors. I truly hate it when publishers do this, especially as there is no indication that this is merely a rehash and not new stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great wok for 2","review":"I wanted a smaller wok because the typical sizes are just unreasonably unwieldy when cooking a small stir-fry for two people. That said, I was a little shocked at how small it was when I first took it out of the box. However, I've found, during use, that this is the perfect size when cooking for two people. Especially if you need access to the other heating elements for side dishes. I think I'd now like a smaller spatula though to allow for easier cornering!Update: If they still sell this product, after 5 years of use it is still going strong and I've come to realize that sealing the surface simply amounts to a bit more patience in allowing the oil and pan to heat up nicely (i.e. shimmery, finger-like oil patterns on the sides, but not smoky)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Pan!!","review":"I purchased this small stir fry pan about 4 yrs and hardly use it. It's a beautiful size for small tasks but when stir frying meats, it's a nightmare. I have several woks including the Lodge cast iron and 2 carbon steel woks. I do prefer cast iron as knowing how to work with it, it can be non stick. I have several cast iron pieces, and my eggs do not stick. For non stick, I have and like the Anolon Advanced Hard Anodized Nonstick 12-Inch Covered Ultimate Pan, very well made. This pan, great size, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very satisfied.","review":"It is sticky and heavy. I don't think it's a worthy buy considering the price...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product!!!!!Very bad!","review":"In this product Features list, it stated as \\" ...with infused anodized technology provides nonstick interior...\\" It sticks! even sticks when I made omelet!!! This is a super stick!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent playing of these 2 comtemporary works","review":"This is a nice coupling of 2 less known comtemparary violin concertos. Perlman is at his usual best and is accompanied well by Previn/Pittsburgh SO. In particular, the Korngold concerto measures up to Heifetz's legendary recording. Moreover, the sound is clear and balance is good. A highly recommended disc for both collectors and casual listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading - brings life to the time period","review":"Joy Hakim's book, From Colonies to Country is part of a series of books on the history of the United States. Hakim whimsically calls the series \\"The History of Us\\". I have used this volume in my classroom to supplement the very dry (and sorry to say, boring) history text. The students actually love it! Some have even asked to borrow my copies of the other books in the series, because they loved this one so much. I find that Hakim is fair in her retelling of the American story, yet she always manages to instill pride in our country. This book is also a great way for adults to add to their own knowledge of our great land's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of the US","review":"As an educator, I found this book exceptional!It is written in a narrative format that isinteresting and easy to understand! I highlyrecommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mama's in the kitchen with tripe","review":"OK, \\"tripe\\" is a bit much, but am I the only Malkmus fan who doesn't like this record? I'm hoping it will grow on me, but as yet, I'd rate it as so-so. Of course any SM fan will appreciate the old-school dark jams of tracks 2 and 6. And I suppose SM should get credit for working with a danceable beat for once in \\"Kindling for the Master\\", but the balance of the record is either boring or just plain annoying. That \\"Mama's in the kitchen with onions\\" song is the \\"Carrot Rope\\" of \\"Face the Truth\\" - i.e., inexplicably bad, incongruous and irritating. I really didn't expect to be disappointed by this one, but I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Face The Truth...The truth about this ablum","review":"To me a five star album is Slanted & Enchanted, Crooked Rain x 2, and Wowee Zowee comes close. Standing this album up next to those three incredible accomplishments from the golden era of this genius song writer leaves one wishing that he'd try a little harder. Having seen his performance at sxsw in 2005 and having given this album a couple of listens I'm left only to conclude that Stephen Malkmus doesn't put much heart or soul into his music anymore. This guy is so good though that I'm sure he can come out with an album like this (which does have good song writing craft) without too much strain. What is missing from this album is the passion, raw energy, and the brilliant unpredictableness that his earlier works contained. The form is there, but I'm just not convinced that anything else is."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"This is not a good album folks. Yes 'it kills' me to say it. This is the weakest thing he's done yet. If you want great Malkmus solo, buy his first solo album, second buy Pig Lib, third, dont buy this album. The weird songs are horrible (1,3, 8) and the rest are boring except track 7. Did he call in Steve Vai on No More Shoes? Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mad awful","review":"What? Worst ever. This is so bad it's funny. 1st solo album = not too bad. Better than Terror Twilight. 2nd album Jicks= not too bad, but pretty bad. this is just like ...What? What are you doing man? finding any merit in this is difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crooked reign","review":"Whereas the first two SM solo albums were self-conscious, three-star compromises, \\"Face the Truth\\" is looser, weirder, wower, zoweer -- less burdened with one's own rep as a late-20th century slacker celeb. In other words, this sounds like Pavement. Great, twisted stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Goddess is ALWAYS good","review":"Even when she's bad, she's good.This footage may not be the best of the best, but worthwhile for any collection.

I could not find a position that did not cause pain and I was desperate for relief. I was skeptical when I ordered this product, but like I stated before, I was desperate. I bought the roll-on, which is the smallest size you can get, to try it out. All I can say is \\"I am hooked\\". It really works! I rolled it on the areas where I was experiencing the discomfort and pain and in a minute or two the pain was gone, I could relax and get some rest. Best product of this type. I recommend to every one I know who has had injuries from whip lash to broken bones and they all have experienced the same effects. I now order it by the gallon! Good stuff...Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gord the rogue is king","review":"Well what can one say, when the father of RPG's decides to write a series of novels? It is fantastic. Taking Gord from small boy in a large corrupt city and following his progression, as he goes from gutter snipe to monte banc, to a hero that can effect the world. Great novels and a great idea of what a good RPG campaign can be like. the only sad note is the last book a bit of Gary's bitterness over being forced out of TSR shows, but still a great read and a great romp of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor educational value","review":"I bought this toy to demonstrate the working of an automotive gearbox to my 12 year old daughter (she was doing a school project).I found the model very clumsy to assemble (or maybe that was just me!), and also realized that you could do only one ratio at a time! So once assembled, it was tough to show various gear ratios and how that change is done!Also, it was just too small -- very tough to use this as a demonstration piece as well. I am unable to understand how this is even called a toy!Anyhow, I ended using pieces of the model (gears separately, shafts separately etc) to create my own crude example of how things work in a real gear box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!","review":"My wife loves these earrings.The only downfall is that they don't have screw on backs.These are beautiful earrings.Thanks for a nice product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but usable","review":"I really wanted a bigger bag so its not serving the purpose that I bought it for.

I was using Cross and Blackwell but since they stopped their curry line the search was daunting but this is just as good, dare I say better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"The book was confusing and dreadful. The only thing I can say good about it is that it mentioned places in Minnesota I am familiar with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Steve Balderson crap","review":"Out of all the wonderful things in Wamego, Kansas to make a documentary about, they picked the one thing Wamego would like to forget. Making sure that I keep this review about \\"Wamego Strikes Back\\" and not the other abominations the Baldersons have produced, this \\"documentary\\" seems very scripted and over-dramatized. The composition is not \\"terrible\\" but not great either. If you haven't seen any of Steve Balderson's films, you could find yourself being caught up in this documentary thinking what a shame it is that Hollywood never picked up any of his movies. I would tell you to go watch \\"Firecraker\\" or \\"Pep-Squad\\" so you can understand why investors dropped his films, but I would never want to inflict that type of torture on another human being. The Baldersons can't write, can't direct and can't produce. Steve's new stuff is even worse than his old. If you receive any of Steve Balderson's films, throw them in the trash because that is exactly where they belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR BIGGER KIDS!!!!","review":"I bought this set for my two daughters, ages 4 and 7. It is cute enough, and comes with a lot of items, but it is WAAAAAAAY smaller than the picture shows. My 4 year old told me it was too short for her to play with, and she is on the smaller side. Plus, it is very flimsy. Overall, I think the Disney one at Toys R Us is a much better cart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"vehicle\\" for toddler boy or girl","review":"My grandson, a 21/2 yr old, enjoys serving tea to his dinosaurs. And when he needs to expand energy, he gleefully pushes the cart through the kitchen-family room-hallway \\"racetrack\\". The cart & teaware are reasonably sturdy. However, the pretend boxes of cookies, sugar & milk are flimsy. Also, the lid to teakettle did not fit properly & we removed it to eliminate frustration. The tea trolley can double as a shopping cart or stroller for wheeling around stuffed animals. The trolley is taller in height for older toddlers who no longer need to use it as a bottom-heavy stabilizing push toy. All in all, it is a good toy for imaginative play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolerable at best","review":"While this textbook vintage British mope rock can hold appeal for fans of nostalgia (as you can practically smell the encased atmosphere scenesters would have engaged at that time and place) in the here and now most material has a hard time escaping parody, let alone a plodding nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with trying to lower ph this way","review":"I've learned that if your water has buffering agents, that are meant to keep the ph stable, trying to lower with this product won't work. I've tripled the dose and still can not get the water near 7.0. Despite what the bottle says, that if you have very hard water you \\"may need to double\\" the dose. Just be cautious with this product. Big swings in ph can be harmful to fish, and keeping ph stable may not work with this product, depending on your water properties. Water here in the Southwest, is 8.4ph. If you have a smaller tank, it is better to do water changes with RO water you can buy from a water machine, that will have lower ph than mess with chemicals to make that happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frenchman's Farm","review":"What attracted me to Frenchman's Farm (1987) was the VHS-cover including the distressed expression on the aforementioned Frenchman's face.....or so I thought. As the story developed it turned into your strangely unsettling creepy mystery/thrillers; the chases, the screams, the gore and then the compelling ending. But this one film did not have your ordinary ending, a great twist on a classic tale.I only wish other films could have been so inventive. A true classic, worthy of all the praise it receives, if not for the sheer brilliant malevolence of the script but for the twist greatness of the end. I came across this movie whilst going through an 80's B-movie phase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should read this!","review":"Although Where the Hell is Indonesia Anyway is a work of fiction, it is actually the personal recollections of the author's experiences as a soldier of fortune pilot involved in clandestine operations for the United States government in the wake of World War II. Nathan Cannon, which is a pen name for the son of a famous World War II hero, was living with his dad in the Philippines in the 1940s when Muslim rebels in Indonesia revolted against their Dutch colonial masters. Clandestinely, the United States supported the rebels and Nat Cannon was heavily involved in the delivery of supplies and providing military support to the Indonesian rebels. This an excellent novel about a little-known aspect of American foreign policy.Sam McGowan, Author - THE CAVE, A Novel of the Vietnam War"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Good Places if You're Our Kind of People","review":"Another reactionary bewailing the loss of \\"community,\\" by which he means places where white heterosexual male Republicans can pretend no one else exists. No celebration of diversity here! There is an insulting prediction that a proliferation of \\"great, good places\\" would eliminate the horrible problem of the existence of gay people. People of color are not mentioned at all, so one presumes they have already ceased to exist. No religious, ethnic, or linguistic minorities, no immigrants, no poor people, just smiling happy faces greeting cronies over coffee. It is astounding that such insensitivity exists in this day and age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, if unfocused","review":"Oldenburg's scholarship here is a little fuzzy -- while I found myself agreeing with many of his points, much of his evidence seemed anecdotal. His cross-cultural comparisons were interesting: the French cafe and the Austrian coffeehouse are institutions that seem, well, very foreign to Americans.There are no substantive mentions of hair salons or bookstores in this work. I'm not sure how they slipped into the title.On the whole, this work raises interesting questions about the decline of public life and public space in American culture. Oldenburg throws a number of darts at the suburbs and poor urban planning, but seems to spend more time lamenting the lost innocence of small-town America than thinking about the future and how things could be turned around. There's a lot of thought-provoking material here, and I think this work represents a good jumping-off point for further consideration and research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for preschoolers","review":"I had this book from the library for as long as I could renew it. I finally broke down and bought it. We're homeschooling our daughter and have started preschool. My daughter's 3 years old, and there are plenty of age-appropriate, FUN experiments in this book.

I am a serious Christian and this book is an insult to Christians everywhere, painting Christianity as nasty, empty-headed, exlusionary biogtry. If this had been written in the 1950s, we could have excused its ignorance and foolishness, but today there is no excuse for it.

I did not feel he was \\"lamenting\\" his childhood as another reviewer feels. The sad parts made me feel very sad, but they are important. Bottom line, I believe, is if the reader is interested in the subjects of life after life and near-death experiences, he or she will enjoy this book; if a reader is skeptical about this kind of stuff, an understandable point of view, he or she will not enjoy it.

How you remind me that song is a joke I know it gets alot of air play and thats because it easy to memorize the word and sing along to but if you really listen to it its a horrible song and it the same way with To bad. I cant wait for the Nickleback era to be over. This isnt rock&roll buy any strecth of the imagination. This is called stealing your money.

Find it somewhere else. \\"Too Bad\\" is the nearest thing to another good song, and it still isn't close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well....","review":"Original? No, not hardly. Yes, it has been done before, and better. But catchy? Yes. The \\"hit\\" everyone apparently knows thanks to overkill play, \\"How You Remind Me,\\" is indeed very catchy. Admittedly it's a decent song, but yes it does become tiresome, especially when you turn to the rest of the CD looking for variety and instead find 9 songs that all sound the same. Some of the songs are done fairly well, but it really is quite repetative, not to mention wholly unoriginal to begin with. One song I do kind of like, if for no other reason than for it almost sounds different from the others, is the hint-of-country-music-influence trend-following \\"Good Times Gone.\\" Even that, though, teeters on the fine line between fun and stupid. All in all, not worth buying in my opinion. Of course, I didn't care much for \\"The State\\" either, so if you liked their debut cd, you'll probably like this one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this CD","review":"Nickleback proves once again how bad rock music can get. Now, I love rock, it's about the only thing I listen to, but rock and roll has really gone down the drain, and these Canadians only make it worse. Every song sounds the same, and that's not good if they sound like crap. Musical? I think not. It's loud and annoying, doing nothing that hasn't been down before. There's just no originality here. I mean none. A cover band has more originality than these guys. Meaningless hrad rock chords mixed with Chad Kroeger's annoying yelling voice and stupid lyrics about how life sucks (like that hasn't been done before) make this one of the owrst CD's of the year.

It isn't quite as good as their debut, Curb, but some great music and angry lyrics set it apart from many of the rest. The songs show a lot of diversity between tracks, with angry and high tempo songs (\\"Never Again\\", \\"Woke Up This Morning\\"), Creed-like songs (\\"Too Bad\\", \\"Hangnail\\") and, to be honest, a couple of below-par efforts (\\"Hollywood\\", \\"Just For\\") which all add up to a must-have CD for fans of this genre.

Just because their earlier cds weren't released in the US doesn't mean they don't exist) comes off as a rather mediocre rehash of their older material. No new ground is broken, and instead they move backwards. The song Just For is the best example. The original version (Just Four) which appeared on Curb is so much better that it is hard to describe. The emotion of the song is gone and it now comes off extremely flat. The single How You Remind Me [sounds like] Finger Eleven's Drag You Down. All in all, quite the disappointing cd. Not awful, but nowhere near as good as their old stuff. If you want Nickelback, pick up the State and try to get a copy of Curb. Silver Side Up isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barely 4 stars","review":"I pretty much would gave this album 3 stars for \\"How You Remind Me\\" alone. I think that song is that good. It's pretty scary when you've heard a song continuously for months, and you're still not sick of it yet. The newest single \\"Too Bad\\" is also very good, but it doesn't compare to \\"How You Remind Me\\". The rest of the stuff on here isn't bad, I just don't think it's good. I'm more of a rap/r&b kind of guy, so part of that is just my personal taste. If you are a rock fan (in particular Staind) you should DEFINITELY BUY THIS ALBUM.

There's this mixture of personal style and husky undertones. I could compare it to that of Scott Stapp from \\"Creed\\", who is also one of the great alternate singers of this time. I bought the CD for \\"How you remind me\\" but I ended up keeping it at the top of my pile cause it's one you can turn on and keep on listening to.

Other such examples are as followed: Puddle of Mudd, Default, and Staind. Like the aforementioned bands, Nickelback is very bad. Once again we have a band playing the same guitar riffs with virtually the same beats as all those other alternative bands. Accompanied by bland and uninspired lyrics. This type of stuff is pretty sickening if you ask me. And what's even more sickening is that people buy into this horrible \\"music\\". I want it all to go away, so take your nickel back. No one with any musical integrity should want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Crap Rock","review":"Nickelback does write about things that I can relate to like family problems and abuse but....this music sounds like crap.Its the type of rock thats so unoriginal and makes you cringe.Its like biting into a stale chip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated - Inconsistent and formulaic! 2.5 stars.","review":"I remember when I bought this album when I was 21. I was so excited to get this at the time. I liked most of the songs and some were so so or sucked. I used to listen to this album pretty often, but I realized that these guys are really not that good. They lack a front man with any range, Chad writes elementary insipid lyrics, and they stick to the same formula. Silver Side Up is not a bad album by any means, but is it not all that great either. If you are going to buy a Nickelback album, get The State and maybe Curb. Avoid Silver Side Up and the rest that come after unless you are a die hard fan. If you are still a fan of Nickelback, it is time to see the light and do away with the mediocre formulaic outfits of the current era."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good Filth!","review":"This cd is a bunch of shi_ it is no good Not even worth a penny only has one good songand and a bunch of cra_ it is bad don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives lamest band ever award a run for its money.","review":"These guys suck. It sounds like Creed only worse. I think it's funny that the little wimpy 'cowardly lion-esque' singer from canada thinks he's tough in that video for never again where he's saying \\"kicking your a$$ would be a pleasure\\" I laughed so hard at that line I fell out of my recliner. I would have severe depression if I lost a fight to that nerdario. Another little tidbit that blows my mind is that they are on Roadrunner records, which, at one point in time was known for putting out brutal metal records, that certainly isn't the case anymore (with the exception of a few, like KSE for instance). Bottomline is, this is bad soft rock with a lame attitude. you should avoid this like black friday at wal-mart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just pierce my eardrums right now...","review":"Chad Kroger sucks my more than any other 'successful' artist in the history of the music industry. He has no talent and needs to learn what real music is and stop feeding such horrible atrosities to our youth to drone over and accept just because some dumbass DJ plays it on a rock station. Just because its on the radion doesn't mean it doesn't suck my ass completely. Please never compliment this no talent hack, because he doesn't know sharps and flats from the smell of is own ass. Anybody giving him more than one star should be shunned forever from making any commentary on music ever again. Thank you for your time and i hope I have enlightened you to how much Nickelback sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickelback...a total disgrace to Canada","review":"Don't buy this or any other CD by Nickelback.

There is no rhythmand no melody to this music at all and yet you yahooslike it. It is just loud and noisy and that's all.

OK eh heh!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Yeah i used to like this band but...... now i dont its a little strange i guess but their posers trying to be like other bands by sayin F*** in one of their songs. AND WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY DOING ON THE BEST RECORD COMPANY IN THE WORLD ROADRUNNER RECORDS HUH!!!! It makes me wonder.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Record","review":"This album was basically the foundation for bigger things to come (The Long Road). An excellent album which would be a great introduction to Nickelback for any new listener. I think you'll find with Silver Side Up, like every other Nickelback album, the \\"hits\\" on the radio and MTV don't offer a complete representation of just how great this band is. I full recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!","review":"Usually, you can't get me to touch any kind of hard rock. After seeing all these kids driving around with their radio volume set on seismic boom, let's just say it really put me off. However, after listening to this CD, I found myself not only liking the music, but the some of the lyrics too. I especially like \\"Never Again\\" and \\"How You Remind Me.\\" In \\"Never Again\\" I applaud them. The line \\"Father is a name you haven't earned yet/ You're just a child with a temper\\" is completely correct! In \\"How You Remind Me,\\" I enjoy both lyrics and tune. Believe me, check it out. Like I said, I usually NEVER touch any hard rock. (though please keep the volume down. You should be able to hear it well enough without causing a 6.5 earthquake)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprise find from my son's generation","review":"I'm a 45 year old mother of a teenaged boy who finally asked him who sang that song that I hear as I'm tuning over to my classic rock radio station. I bought the CD and was pulled in by the bass line and the clear, hammering drums. I'm hooked on this CD. In a strange way, it reminds me of many of the bands that I loved back in the 70's and 80's and fits right into my hard rock library. You've got to try it. But, my advice is to try it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bomb","review":"As a fan of Nickel back this is the bomb, I wish more bands bunddled DVDs with CDs or put both video and thier tracks on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good cd - no matter how unoriginal","review":"So this band isn't original... who cares? Sorry to inform you all but pretty much everything has been done before. Theres no mix of metal, grunge, blues or anything else left; unless you want to start a country-rap band, then be my guest. I'm sure it will sound great....Anyway, like I said, this is a good cd, plain and simple. Some of the tracks are quite grungy, which is good in my opinion. My favorite tracks are \\"Look What Your Money Bought\\", \\"Just For\\", and \\"Woke Up This Morning\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickelback keeps on rockin'!","review":"I bought the CD \\"Silver Side Up\\" tonight. I had previously heard \\"Never Again\\", \\"How You Remind Me\\", & \\"Too Bad\\" through MP3 downloads, but WOW for 10 songs this CD is awesome.Never Again - Hard but keeps me entertained throughoutHow You Remind Me - Great catchy tune w/ a soft side too itWoke Up This Morning - Another great hard tuneToo Bad - Shows their sensitive side BEST SONG ON THE CD!Just For - Great Hard tune which shows their ability to rock!Hollywood - Catchy beginning riff that'll have ya singing it all dayMoney Bought - Amazing drums & vocals some high powered music!Where Do I Hide - Guitar just screams like hell! HELL YEAH!Hangnail - Fluid throughout the song!Good Times Gone - Softest tune on the CD still amazingSo if you haven't bought the album get it. The State, Hesher, & Curb were amazing but you ain't heard nothin' yet!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"only silver plated..","review":"As everyone else has already stated the CD starts off good with \\"Never Again\\" and \\"How You Remind Me,\\" not suprisingly the two hit singles, but after that there isn't anything else that really stands out. Plus, with the radio stations playing the only two good songs constantly they get old really quick. I was really dissapointed in this CD.. and the fact that there are now dozens of bands that sound just like this one. Theres no originality anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"God i hate song by song reviews","review":"There really is no point giving a song by song review of Silver Side Up because there are such minor differences between each song. Nickelback make generic made-for-radio angst rock. When it comes down to it, they're really just a heavier Matchbox 20, or is that 3 doors down? Anyway, if you swapped the members of Nickelback with the members of 3 Doors Down, the average listener wouldn't be able to tell the difference. It's all the same commercial radio fodder. There are better more creative rock albums out there!!, i swear it!!, please beleive me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"It doesn't take a genius to realize that Nickelback are unoriginal, derivative and simplistic. So why all the 5 star reviews? I think that most of the people who have written reviews for this album buy about 3 cd's per year, or they are just kids who blindly go out and buy every peice of trash rock anthem they see on MTV. \\"How you Remind me\\" is a likeable peice of pop rock, but you can't honestly say that this whole album is as good as that song. Every other track sounds like they have taken one song and rearranged it 10 different ways to fill up the rest of the cd. The lyrics are simplistic and blatant. Chad Kroeger trys so hard to sound morally upstanding yet at the same time so down and defeated. Its pathetic. Get some soul and some creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, though check out \\"The State\\"","review":"Face it, music today really is crap. Nickelback certainly isn't breaking ground, but they are talented and they put on one great live show, meaning they are better than most bands today. Whether that means anything ... who knows. But if you can see them live, run and do it.Anyway, this disc is solid, but if you liked it ... go get The State. It's much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a dump on their debut and put it in the C.D. player...","review":"... then you'll know what this sounds like. I mean, what the hell happened to the, they were already soft, but now??? Now it is a piece of modern rock bull[edit]. There songs are catchy, the lyrics (are bad), all it is is N'SYNC on acid sorta like [st]linkin park. This [edit] is really starting to (get bad)...-FM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes my day feel whole","review":"This is why i have to look elsewhere for good rocking music. This is the best album ive heard in ages. Its passionate, and really makes you feel lifted. If your reading this and dont have the album - get it now !!!!!One word for it - inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great combination","review":"Well, Nickelback has done it again. With a great combination of the slide guitar and bass, they have outdone themselves and elevated their status as true original rockers. Great solo in \\"Money bought\\". As a previous review stated, this band has easily distinguished themselves from so many others copycats who \\"clog our airways\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"If you like Nickleback, you'll like this. A few real gems like \\"Too Bad\\" stick out the first time, but it doesn't take long to realize the whole CD is a good listen for just about any occasion. Not for those who like to pick apart their music for neat compositional tricks and deep lyrics, but quite enjoyable nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no, another one of those bands!!!","review":"My God, another one of those bands! The vocals are all the same!! The CD starts pretty well, then after two or three songs things fall in the same category: noise, identical vocals, a mess of tracks badly mixed to cover the band's debilities!! IT's a mixture of grunge and nu-metal... well, whatever, this CD is junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This CD is very very good. I recommend it to anyone who likes staind, creed, Our Lady Peace, or any other good music. This is not a cd based just on How You Remind Me, it Has Many Other Good Songs, Such as My personal favorite, Too Bad. Hangnail and Never again are also quite good, and all the songs are at least Decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This R-O-C-K-S!","review":"My friend was talking to me in science and said his favorite band was Nicklback. I was ranting on about Duncan Sheik. I said\\"Who is Nickleback?\\" One day,I was surfin the net for lyrics and I found \\"How you Remind Me\\". Thinking it was a misnamed Usher song, I clicked. I found one of the best rock songs ever. I'm a die-hard N'Sync fan, but this is such an appealing album that couldn't be passed it up. Thank you Wes(friend) and Nickleback! Buy this CD! Even if you hate rock, this album will open your eyes to the wonderful world that is Nickleback!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two stars for the two songs I like!!","review":"I heard from some acquaintances of mine how good this album is. I decided it was time to hear it for myself and downloaded it. Hoestly people, this album is really nothing special. The only two songs worth replaying are \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Too Bad\\". I used to like \\"How You Remind Me\\" before radio stations everywhere overplayed it to death! The rest of the songs are just mediocre, repetitive rock songs with nothing special about them. Maybe I would like some of these new alternative rock bands if they actually had some substance!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Further Decline of good music","review":"First off I'd like to ask a question. What in the blue hell is a band like this doing on Roadrunner Records? Roadrunner is home to such bands as Misfits, Slipknot, Obituary, Soulfly...does this sound like a label that should carry a horrible Creed/Live want-to-be band?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what is this?","review":"This is VERY bad. It gets one star for one OKAY song. But all you need to do is listen to the first song and then you'll know the rest of the cd. This cd is so bad the first time i listend to the whole thing fully, i had already decided i would never listen to it again. If you want something that is really bad and overplayed, but if you want a good cd DO NOT GET THIS CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Hard Rock","review":"Nickelback's second album is a collection of generic hard rock songs. The Canadian quartet is the 21st century version of such 70's acts like Kansas or Molly Hatchet, faceless bands who play faceless music. The band's number one hit \\"How You Remind Me\\" is actually a good, catchy song with some stinging lyrics about a broken relationship. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is one derivation after another of that theme that aren't quite as catchy as \\"How You Remind Me\\". Silver Side Up doesn't offer anything groundbreaking or original, but if you like hard rock music, then this album may be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good but there are better bands.","review":"Silver Side Up is one of Nickelback's finest albums. However, I do agree with others that say a lot of their songs are repetitive and sound alike. If you want to hear some truly astounding music, just pick up Master of Puppets by Metallica."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all...","review":"Not a bad rock CD for anybody's collection. Although \\"How You Remind Me\\" get's too much airplay (see Staind's \\"It's Been Awhile\\") for my taste, the other songs are quite good. If you like your rock a little hard, and full flavored, this one is worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"You guys are too up and down!","review":"Contrary to the ignorant people who either give this 1 or 5 stars, I know that this CD actually is not half as bad, or good, as they state it to be. I feel people with personal hatred of this type of music should not be able to write reviews, and those too narrowminded should not be allowed to rate anything with 4-5 stars, as they lack the capacity of giving suggestion to anyone else. This CD, Silver Side Up, by Nickelback is a mediocre album. It lacks originality in all but two songs: \\"Two Bad\\" and \\"How You Remind Me\\", these two, any pop-rock band would be proud of. As for a 'return to rock', this band does not have the ability of bringing 'rock' back as much as uncreative 'pop'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistent and yet diversified","review":"For those who enjoy the style of Nickelback's music and lyrics, this album will not disappoint. True to their musical journey and unique style, this album will fit in to your expectations on a platform of good quality production. With a blend of upbeat tempo and slow content, the group expands on their musical path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"I'm a big Nickelback fan and this is one of my favorites! I have all of the CDs and love a majority of the songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"some people like Justin Wittenmeier, who's alias is 'Slipknot dude' don't appreciate good music. Slipknot has one or two good songs, but there boring, I'll they do is 'bark' and scream at the top of their lungs, yeah, great music, can't even understand their lyrics.Nickelback is a grade A band, terrific head singer, Chad Kroeger, is just a natural at singing. This CD is worth every penny. I bought it, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"NickelBack ROCKS!!","review":"If u like all the rock out there right now u will like this cd. This cd rocks, songs #1,2,4,6 are the rockin ones. the voice,drums,guitars and etc. go so well together. if u like creed, tantric, collective soul, music like that, you will like this new nickelback CD!!!!!!!!!!!!! go buy it. thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look At The Silver Side First","review":"Yeah, yeah, those of you who know me(if not check my profile) you know I am a big tme Heavy Metal fan, but i really loe this album, infact, some of the music could actually be described as Heavy Metal, the rest is mostly hard rock. I really reccomend this to anyone, this is definitely NickelBack's best cd, the hardest i've ever heard by them. Please, don't overlook this album just because it's rock man, any [Hard] Rock or Heavy Metal fan is gobba love this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me wish I didn't have ears.","review":"Whenever I hear these singles on the radio, I want to gouge my ears with an ice pick just so I never have to hear another Nickelback song. I flip through 4 stations and sometimes all 4 are playing Nickelback(or someone trying to sound like them). If this is the sound of this generation, then music is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is too much","review":"... Nickelback's debut \\"The State\\" was half decent, the only reason I bought into that was because sometimes they reminded me of Alice in Chains but more poppy. The day I heard \\"How You Remind Me\\" I almost crashed my car laughing, now Nickelback sounds like Creed trying to imitate Soundgarden. I finally managed to listen to this album, and nearly every song is a rip off of some sort or another of Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam, except Nickelback has lost the edge they had on \\"The State\\" and replaced it with more catchy hooks and pop melodies than one can swallow. With the recent wave of all the new \\"delicate, sensitive\\" hard rock like Nickelback, Creed, Staind, and Puddle of Mudd, hard rock/heavy metal as we know it is quickly going down .... I for one have had enough of this ..., ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, who could think of such genius like lyrics? The wall?","review":"Gee whiz, when I first heard\\"Never Again\\" on the radio, I thought the world was going to end. I will be honest, I have never heard another song off their album. Do I need to? No. Do I want to? No. Do you people requesting this stuff want to? Yes, I'm afraid that you just might. That is why I am here to help you realize the ultimate complexity and musical genius that it does not have. The song never again brought a tear to my eye, because I could not stop laughing. The words that I was hearing were so funny that I had to hear it again. This is a true story. Yes, I too requested this song so I could laugh once more. I hope, no, I pray that this is also why you are requesting this garbage. But if it is not, and this is what our world is coming down to, if this is the music that our nation admires gives attention to, then may God watch over your souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as durable as the band \\"Living Syndication\\"","review":"Nickelback is truly one of the best bands out of Canada to hit the states in some time. I've been waiting for them to get the exposure they have deserved for some time now.. They sound a lot like the band \\"Living Syndication\\" ...though that is where the similarities end.. They are a great band and this CD, like the \\"Om Factor\\" one are worth having!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rock cd.","review":"Great cd. I think it is very similar to their cd \\"the state\\". If you like it you should like this. \\"how you remind me\\" is probably the best song on the cd. \\"Never Again\\" is an emotional song about domestic violence. Overall i'd have to say i'm disappointed that it only had 10 tracks on it but at least most of them are good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nickelback Scores","review":"The cut \\"Never Again\\" is arguably the most driving and powerful of the 10 tracks, but one of the better tracks that no one seems to be mentioning is \\"Just For.\\" Continuing the theme of protection of wounded women that the first track \\"Never Again\\" advances, \\"Just For\\" is quieter but with a burning anger that sticks in one's mind. Consider these lyrics:\\"I want to take his eyes out, just for looking at you...yes I do.And I want to take his hands off, just for touching you...yes I do.And I want to rip his heart out, just for hurting you and I want to break his back now....yes I do.\\"All told, Nickelback has scored again with an even stronger album than their excellent release of last year, The State. Do yourself a favor, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy an album unless you hear it first.","review":"I loved The State, so I bought Silver Side Up with only hearing How You Remind Me. Bad move. While the album appears to be more personal with songs that seem to be about an abusive father-figure and similar - it just sounds too much like cheesy 80's rock. While I like How You Remind Me, the \\"yeah yeah, no no\\" repeated over and over again is tiring, and a lot of the album is like that. Its like they were grasping for rhymes and so on. I'm going to listen to it a few more times, but it doesnt compare to The State."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa","review":"Stupid thing says i'm twelve when im 15... ugh...All i gotta sya is \\"Whoa\\", this CD is fricken awesome!! Every song kicks ass, and rocks! You will be singing the lyrics all day, and thats a long time! The first listen i didn't really catch the songs to well. but i went for a second listen, listened to each song, and it blew me away, every song is unbeleivably good!

Nickleback has achieved the difficult task of creating a true rock album that also apeals to many pop fans.Any one song on this album would make the CD worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Definite Step Down","review":"Nickelback's sophomore effort is disappointing, to say the least. Their first, \\"The State,\\" was one of the best albums of 2000. The industrial/grunge combination blew Nickelback's competitors out of the water. And then came \\"Silver.\\" Nickelback decided to dump its industrial influences and go with metal/grunge, probably in an attempt to cash in on Staind's success, while at the same time essentially losing all its originality. After hearing \\"How You Remind Me,\\" the only great song on the album, I rushed out and bought \\"SSU\\" the day it was released on a whim. Never have I been more disappointed. These songs lack the power of \\"Breathe,\\" \\"Old Enough,\\" and \\"Worthy to Say,\\" songs from their debut album. Not to mention the riffs are drudgy and unoriginal. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"What you can't give no stars?","review":"...Alternative music is starting to sound like one band is making all the music and changing their name.

I was hoping that it would have some great variety as the song itself had but I was wrong. The CD just sounds like it's the same song played over and over again. I bought it for the one song, so that was my fault but I guess higher expectations just hurt my rating of the cd in general.... sorry if I have offended anyone. I just feel that their last CD was better in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT GRUNGE!!!","review":"This cd is a waste of your time, and money. Nearly every song sounds similar to the other & they quickly become repetetive. forget these guys, along with those other bands (Default) & (Puddle of Mudd). No matter what the magazines & tv are saying, believe me, THEY ARE NOT GRUNGE!bands like Mudhoney & Soundgarden(real grunge bands) have so much more of an edge that these guys really lack, plus they're not so \\"wha-wha\\" (feel sorry for me) sounding like nickelback sounds.Save your cash & buy \\"bad motor finger\\" by soundgarden instead, it's a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kerrang review","review":"Kerrang reviewed this band and gave them nothing.

Ever hear the Beatles??? What about Nirvana?! What about ANY band you hear?! I'm not saying they're boring, I'm saying they all use the verse-chorus-verse style. And geez, are THEY boring?? No. The Beatles will be remembered forever as one of the greatest bands of all time. As will Nirvana. If nothing else, Nickelback will be known for the most played song (\\"How You Remind Me\\") of, I believe, 2002. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm the first to review this album? Woohoo!","review":"It sounds pretty good so far, a little repetitiveness in the hooks and riffs, but hey, even perfection has it's flaws.

I loved How You Remind Me and Too Bad so I decided to buy the cd. A band compared to Staind in lyrics, Nickelback didn't impress me with a few vulgar words. However, the melodies were catchy and I found myself humming Never Again, but not singing it. It deserves a little lower but the melodies is what I was impressed with.

But I was very diappointed. Besides \\"You Remind Me\\", there was only one or two other songs I enjoyed on the album.It is really hard to pinpoint why or why not music is good to listen too, but for some reason the majority of the songs on this CD just annoyed me. I thought the lyrics were unoriginal and boring, as was the music itself.If you liked the style of \\"You Remind Me\\" or are considering getting this CD, you are much better off getting a CD from similar, but better groups, like Lifehouse, Matchbox 20, or The Calling, all of whose CDs I prefered to this one. So save your money and get something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it or not, it's helping bring rock back","review":"I love this CD. I was a fan of this band even before \\"How You Remind Me\\", the first time I heard \\"Worthy To Say\\" off \\"The State\\" (which by the way is NOT their first album), I was hooked. This honestly doesn't break much new ground, but it does what it does very well. I never really get tired of it, \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" is a song everyone on earth can relate to, \\"Good Times Gone\\" experiments a little bit with great results, and on and on. Bottom line: just go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nickleflop","review":"In 1970, 2 British groups, Led Zeppelin (in \\"LZ 2\\") and Deep Purple (in \\"In Rock\\") established the formula of hard rock. Since then hundrets of hard rock groups repeated the formula time and again, made it poor, primitive, moronic, limited, and boring. From time to time we had the chance to listen to something else (like Nirvana and few more from Seatle), but it was an ekseption. \\"How you remind me\\" had that fresh-promising sound which made me buy the CD. Bad mistake. 3 good starters and then - total boredom. You'd be amazed to know how easy it was to fall asleep after listening to that noisy boring hard rock group. Sleeping pill couldn't do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Rock","review":"Why on earth Nickelback are being credited for a grunge rival is beyond my apprehension. Their shows featuring pyrotechnics, and leather trousered rock posturing, brings to mind that famous Cobain phrase.There's no doubt they have the ability to craft catchy riffs and sing along melodies, but you get the feeling their trying too hard to be too many things to too many people. The radio freindly guitar licks appeal to the wannabe-grungers who find Alice In Chains and Nirvana too raw, and the attempted angsty lyrics appeal to the rebelious and disillusioned kiddies.In reality, the riffs are simple power chords, (getting tedious very quickly) and the lyrics are overly narrative and lacking in any real poetic mystery or meaning.In short Silver Side Up is rock by numbers.An excellent quote from a Radio DJ on Nickelback:\\"It's bizarre to mention Nickelback in the same sentance as Nirvana. Kurt would be ricocheting off his coffin lid.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"The only reason this song got so popular was because they wronte the most \\"radio-friendly\\" song in existance.

This is how this band reminds me of all the other top 40 MTV bands that I've ever heard, all smashed together with pretty girl videos and pretty long hair and a cute guitarist.Does anyone remember how to make exciting, creative music anymore?

Their song \\"How You Remind Me\\" was nominated for record of the yearat the 2003 Grammy Awards. \\"Never Again\\" is a discription of demestic violence. Chad Kroeger, Ryan Peake(vocals, guitar); Mike Kroeger (bass); Ryan \\"Nik\\" Vikedal (drums)make this band ROCK!!!

Please go listen to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The downfall of the human race lies on this cd","review":"Nickleback is without one of the worst bands in current history. All of there is music is very repetitive, it all sounds the same. In addition to this the songs are very poorly written. The guitar rifts are just the same three powercords. The lead singer(whatever his name is) cant sing... They should release this album five times, but with a different cover, and Nickelback fans could not tell the difference. And to top it all of Nickelback is mainstream, so you hear this junk non-stop. It all points down the same ally, they want money, so dont bie this, because if you do your helping them out.They should change there name to MoneyBack, because if you ever bie this thats what you will want."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the Songs are the same","review":"I couldn't believe this album. I put in the CD in the player and pushed play. Song 1...alright, not bad. Song 2...wait isnt that Song 1. Ok, Song 3...what the...same as 1 and 2. Ok...I went through every track and besides the overplayed but good song \\"How you remind me\\" every song is the same. I swear a couple of them use the exact same guitar riff just slightly different distortion. Anyways, I was extremely disappointed in this album because all the songs are the same with different depressing lyrics that not many can relate to. Not worth the money...just download their hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this cd thinking that it was going to be good. I had heard the single How You Remind me and I thought it was good. The cd is anything but. The only songs that are half decent are Never Again and Too Bad and How You remind me, but once you have heard them a few times then they have served their cause. The rest of this cd is completely [junk]. This band should go for something a little more original and less repetitive. They should try and get more lyrics in instead of repeating themselves and make the music sound different on each song. This akbum is just rushed and a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"ACCCHHH!","review":"Nevermind Nickelback, I want my [money] back that I shelled out for this.

There was a time once when I thought Papa Roach was all that, then my friend gave me about 20 cd's full of Pantera, Korn, Mudvayne, A Perfect Circle, and Tool, and I realized how talentless and immature Papa Roach was.

It lacks the depth of other much more notable albums that were released last year (i.e. sevendust and creed's new albums). While no band can revamp their sound entirely from song to song, I find myself having to ask, \\"which song is this again?\\" If it's not the over-played radio hit \\"how you remind me\\" I find myself browsing the CD case to figure out what I'm listening to. I can't fathom why anyone would \\"love\\" this CD, which sounds more like an extension of their first album than new sound/new material. Pedestrian and lack-luster. At least there is only 40 minutes of monotony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the single instead...","review":"\\"How You Remind Me\\" is definitely one of the catchiest songs of the year and I bought this CD because of it. Unfortunately, except for \\"Never Again\\", the rest of the songs are boring and sound the same. The band has potential, but they only offer a glimpse of it here. Assuming you're interested because of the single, I'd suggest checking out the Transmatic album. Not as heavy, but you'll find a CD full of songs as captivating as the song that brought you here."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Song","review":"The lead singer has a great voice and the song \\"How You Remind Me\\" is awesome; however, the other songs don't measure up to that track.

But honestly that went away shortly and my face did seem less red and my dermatitis went away in 2 days of using this product. I simply don't understand why the makers of this lotion would put so much fragrance in something so marketed for those with very sensitive skin.

The Liverpool born writer tells the story of monsters living under a cemetery and a man who is destined to become one of them. Later made into the film Nightbreed, this book pulls no punches, and is considerably stronger in content than the film. However Barker tells it in such a way it engrosses rather than offends, and opens up a magical world that becomes reality very quickly.

However if you read the many reviews on the internet and scroll through them you will see mine is a common problem.I also own the philips 1080p up-converting DVD player and that one works flawlessly, except it has not optical audio output.Warranty may be great and all but I also want something that works with no hassle.

The list of divas here are impressive. You start of with Tebaldi and end with Callas. You can't get any better than that! This is a highly enjoyable CD. All singers were in top form. I especially enjoy the Violetta's finale by Olivero with the crazy LAUGH.Although the singing is first rate, the disc have some hisses and noise which one would think should not have occurred after 1950. The Caballe recording had several skips which was unacceptable. Also annoying was the lack of dates of the actual performances and the tenor who performed with the diva (especially the Callas's Sulla tomba).

When he got home I prepared to clean his thermos and the soup was still hot after working from 6 am and driving home at about 6 pm. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Product!","review":"I bought this for my son several weeks ago because he wanted hot lunches but didn't like the selection at school. Honestly, I bought it mostly based on all the positive reviews. I was eager to see if it worked as well as most people said it did.Well, my son has mostly taken soups to school in it, and he says that the soup is always as hot as if it just came off the stove. Just today he took pasta in it, and he said it was just as hot.In the morning, I leave the boiling water in for just 5 minutes, and the latest my son has lunch at school is 12:15. I prepare the thermos at 6:30 a.m.! It's also the perfect size for a couple of servings and fits nicely in the side pocket of his backpack.I would HIGHLY recommend this product!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific food jar!","review":"I received this item as a gift and today is the first chance I got to try it \\"in the field\\". I am very happy with it as it has met all my expectations. It:- completely holds a 10oz can of condensed soup(with water)- keeps food hot. After 9 hours, I wouldn't say my soup was \\"piping\\"hot, but it was hot enough that I did _not_ have to put it inthe microwave.- does not leak. It was on its side for those 9 hours.- has a wide mouth. Made cleaning it easier. Also, with the wide mouth,I would expect you could eat directly from the jar (rather than pouringinto the lid first).Soup is the staple of my lunch, but I am anxious to try the jar with other foods as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"I don't know, it worked initially and then over a short period of time it quit holding the temp, even though I prepped with boiling water. It's disheartening to have luke warm soup 3 hours later.

This Stanley has not worked. He says it does not keep the food hot. For the price I paid, I would have expected a better product.

Before putting the soup in I preheated the thermos by putting hot water in it. I heated the soup in the microwave to near boiling because I knew it was going to be several hours before Id eat it. The thermos was in a gym-type bag in an unheated building with the outdoor temperature ranging from 60 to 48 later in the evening. Seven hours after filling the thermos I opened it to find the soup COLD--not warm, cold. If it was luke warm, I could deal with it, but I would have had the same outcome if I had put it in a plastic bowl. My son was with me and he said he put coffee in his to take to work, in a Sears garage, and his kept his coffee warm for as many hours.

Christy can somewhat maintain the long notes in songs but really lacks a melodious voice. I was very dissapointed with most of the songs on her CD, with \\"Dive in\\" being the only good one. The other songs are just your run-of-the-mill mediocre pop songs. If you are looking for a great young singer, Anne Hathaway has an AMAZING voice, truly superior to Christy's. Anne sings \\"Somebody to Love\\" beautifully in the movie \\"Ella Enchanted.\\" I hope she makes a CD someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's bounce! Into another world! So we, don't!

It's like rocket science,On how fast you outgrow it! Disney has gone too far.I recommend: Michelle Branch, Avril Lavigne and Norah Jones.Here's some advice, don't go Disney, their sick!They think girls are sparkle princesses.

It tells you to be you, unlike Hilary Duff, who sings about boys and why she doesnt want to be herself. Plus Christy has been on Broadway, meaning she actually has a voice.Raven and Lindsay Lohan can sing, just not as good as Christy."},{"rating":"1","title":"God help us...","review":"Christy Carlson Romano is a terrific comedianne. She's very funny as an actress, but definitely can't sing. To contradict a previous reviewer, just because she was on Broadway doesn't mean she has vocal talent. I saw her in New York as Belle in Beauty and the Beast and was quite ticked off actually. I love the Original Cast Recording of the show with Susan Egan (now there's talent!), and expected peformances to be of equal caliber when I saw the show. Obviously I was very disappointed with the lead. Seems they only got Christy for her star appeal, hoping her name would sell tickets. Looks like they're hoping the same with this album as that is the only reason anyone would record such a mediocre performance. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 Star For Dream Vacation","review":"This ISN'T Joseph. I am his oldest DAUGHTER.Like I said, 1 star for Dream Vacation. The rest of this album SUCKS. Christy is a much better actor than a singer and this record proves it. Below is my analyzation of every song:1. Dive In: 0/5. This song stinks. I heard it about fifty times on Disney and it made me wanna throw a shoe at the television.2. Let's Bounce: 0/5. The song title says it all.3. Anyone But Me: 0/5. Her voice is annoying.4. Colors Of The Wind: 0/5. Voice is nasal and annoying.5. Say The Word: 2/5. Catchy Beat.6. Could It Be: 0/5. she sounds AWFUL.7. Dream Vacation: 5/5. Catchy song. The only one worth listening to on this CD.8. Teacher's Pet: 2/5. Okay song. Get's annoying after a while though because Christy sounds nasal.9. Better than the song by itself. We at least have something to take our minds off the singing.In conclusion, buy this album used for Dream Vacation. Or, skip it completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mgirl","review":"Christy is nice and a good actress but, I do not like her singing she is too naisil. some people said that 9 year olds would enjoy this but I disagree.

I think that you would enjoy it no matter what your age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This album is horrible. Christy's voice is annoying and most of the songs she sings are very childish. The only song that is sorta good is Colors Of The Wind.

Most of the singers I have liked like Aly & AJ and Raven for examples but Chrisy's music wasn't for me. The style of her music is pop like most of the other Disney stars. I like pop so I thought I'd like Christys music I heard the Teachers Pet song it wasn't bad then about five months later they aired Dive In I found myself turning off the TV I thought it was horrible. It aired so much I really couldn't stand it. Christy is a good actress and she should stay with acting but singing isn't for her. I reccomed you buy Into The Rush.

This appears to be the best if not the only book on this subject matter. No other book looks at some of these films the way Killing For Culture does. As much as we would like to turn away from many of these films they represent interesting extremes and often serve to remind us of what exists and what is always around the corner--death. Its representations in cinema are often striking, controversial, disturbing, and whether we like it or not, memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in the business","review":"With all of the hoopla surrounding Death/Snuff films (8mm and the older flick that mearly contained an interest in it \\"Videodrome\\"), someone had to break the field and shove it straight into our face.

While these are only freshwater pearls they are high luster and look great. Their description on the website is a very accurate representation of how they look in real life: they are near-round, some pearls have very slight blemishes, and their color is uniform. The clasp does have a 14K stamp on it, however it does not look very heavy duty. The copy of the certificate of appraisal is an ok addition to the necklace, but I did not include it when I gift wrapped the necklace. The certificate looks a little ordinary with its photo copy look and July 2004 appraisal date. Overall I would say this is a great purchase for someone looking for a pearl necklace, it looks great and you'll have people guessing as to how much you spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my necklace!","review":"I added it to my Wishlist & received it for Christmas.

No real information on how to invest into bonds, but just what they are and how interest rates and time can change the market value of them.To end on a positive note...

The movie was absolutely hilarious and poked fun at all sorts of things in pop culture (including itself), the lead actresses were great and the silliness perfectly silly; but it was the soundtrack that really sold me! The songs are catchy, rocky and sung with attitude that made my friends and I want to rush out and join a girl rock band. Definitely *not* the Spice Girls or Destiny's Child. Even the goofy songs spoofing boy-bands by the movie's Du Jour are fun (and perfect. I could hear any boyband from NKOTB to Backstreet doing one of these \\"winners\\" ;P. Scary thought.) My favorite songs are \\"Three Words\\" which seems to embody the Josie attitude, and their cover of \\"Money\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun","review":"I watched the movie which was fun and quirky.

Unfotunately the cd is padded out with two tracks of boy-band nonsense, so just skip them and rock out with the reworked (now even sassier!) version of the Josie and the Pussycats theme song.Ex-Letters to Cleo singer Kay Hanley provides yelping vocals (Rolling Stone has described her voice as \\"bratty but sweet\\")that capture the free-spirited excitement of the film, altough her voice isn't used to its full capacity. For that check out the Cleo's debut Aurora Gory Alice.All around one of my favorite records."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music is definitely better quality than the movie","review":"Like any loyal Archie comics fan, I was ecstatic to find ou that Josie and her plas were making it to the big screen. Unfortunately, though, the movie was contrived and was more like VH1 Behind the Music of the Supremes combined with Internet conspiracy theories.

Best songs: \\"pretend to be nice\\", \\"shapeshifter\\", their version of the Iggy standard \\"real wild child\\" and the punkified version of the theme songs. (They didn't need to cover the done-to-death \\"money\\" however.) Even if you didn't like-or didn't see-the movie you will enjoy this soundtrack (Note: you WILL want to skip the annoying \\"DeJor\\" hits!)You may also wanna sniff out the soundtracks to \\"Hard Core Logo\\" and especially \\"Prey For Rock & Roll\\" (but not the movies!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST","review":"This is my favorite Soundtrack.It has all the songs that the Pussycats preform and afew they don't.It also contains the Dujour songs,\\"Backdoor Lover\\" and \\"Around the World\\".One last thing it's not the actors singing on this CD,in very small print,in the jacket, it says who the real singers are.But it's still a great Soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"***STUNNING WORK ACCOMPLISHED BY ONE AMAZING GROUP***","review":"Josie and the pussycats is worth every penny.

I think that song is really beautiful, actually.The two DuJour songs are pretty awful; the guys can't sing and the lyrics are dribble, but that makes it funny!

Nice simple stage set with very nice lighting. Audio is top-notch. And the cameras... you'll fly across the heads of the audience right up to the nose of the performer, cut to another close-up from the other side, then cut to a wide shot of the whole theater, and you'll never even see a camera in the picture in the whole show.This was a PBS show used during fund-raising campaigns at some stations, but didn't do very well in most markets, so many PBS stations have never run the show at all.Oh, and the music... If you know all these people, Cyril, Led, Makaha Sons, Brothers Caz, Na Leo, Willy and Amy, and more, you know it's superb. No reason for me to tell you that here.

This is an action-packed, long dvd with tons of neat and useful principles with many demonstrations. My only complaint is that the attacker in the film, poor fellow, seems to overact his part at times. Now before you say I am a non-believer, trust me, I know that Vladimir hits very very hard and fast, but some of his flopping around is a little too \\"dramatique pour moi.\\" Even so, this is only a minor distraction in a really fantastic and timely dvd.

Let me tell you, there is nothing better than light massaging and soft caresses to get a woman going. And, at such times, a vibrating massager such as this really adds to the feeling.When the caressing of the muscles is over, this vibrator makes an excellent sex toy. Its shape and smooth texture means that it will comfortably fit into your lovemaking without any disruption. It works off of 2-AA batteries, and has a rotating switch on the end that allows you to modulate the frequency of the vibration up from low to high and intense.I think that this is a great massager/vibrator. Also, if you are looking for a first massager, this is a very good one to start with. It has a pleasant, non-threatening (even exciting!) color and general appearance, and its rotating power switch allows you to set your own power level.

On top of that...once you tighten the screw back in it loses its ability to change speeds and sometimes it turns off while you are using it. I only paid $1.00 and I see why. Also, the packaging could have been a lot better. It cam in a manila envelope and it was wrapped in bubble wrap. This made me nervous...is it used? It makes you wonder.

Ian Gillan is mixed nice and loud - and these SONGS are really GREAT! If this gets much airplay, I think Purple will have a nice return to the mainstream eye. \\"Walk On\\" is a song I keep pressing \\"play\\" on, over and over, as is \\"Doing It Tonight.\\" And \\"Haunted\\" is very stately and elegant. \\"Sun Goes Down\\" ROCKS - Well done, gents!!!

Also, there is no filler here, all the material rates high in quality.The one serious problem that Purple has is the albatross of their own legend, when they perform live. They should not try to please so many with all those 70's songs that fail to reach the standands of their work presented on each of their last three albums.

They must be from a time when this package was more expensive. If you add up the original prices of all the stuff in this package...a Wii, 3 games, and an extra remote and nunchuk, it's about $500 after tax. This is about the price it is currently being sold for on Amazon. Considering that it's often difficult to find a Wii in stores, these prices are fair.As for the games in this package...perfect for a teen. Zelda is the best game of the bundle and takes a long time to beat. Red Steel is a little hard to control sometimes, but not a bad game. Tony Hawk is really fun if you're into the skating games. We still play Wii Sports, included with the Wii the most though.

No only did this dried up the hard painful bumps in the area between my lower lip and chin, but it also meanwhile concealed the redness beautifully. I couldn't tell the difference between this and other brands like L'Oreal because it does such a nice job. And what more? Unlike other concealers, not only do you not have to take if off at night when you sleep, it is encouraged for you to apply it often! While not a qualm with me, I can see other people being turned off by the sulfur smell, but I guarantee you you'll be used to it soon enough, and might even enjoy it somewhat.

Instead, Giles poorly attempts to engage the reader through cliches' and his own brand of catchy-phrases as \\"hooks\\" for the next page. Sure, his target audience obviously is not the adult market, but please, at least engage young people with intellectual acumen. My kids wanted to throw the book across the room (that would have been okay if a liberal were in the way :). Maybe wait for one to resell as \\"used\\" at $.95 and then get a copy. On a more serious note, Christians must learn to engage the real world with real arguments that cut to the quick and challenge thinking.

I don't agree with the homosexual lifestyle, but there are more productive ways to deal with it, first by spending a lot of time with your children and educating them (the public schools don't).

I read the book and agree with their points, and am left with the distinct impression that Mr. Giles is full of himself. This \\"tough guy\\" approach and name-calling is a real turn-off in my book. Hey, Doug...give some straight forward arguments minus your witless sarcasm, and write in a logical way so that we plebians can understand.

These are hard to find -- in fact, very obscure and rare items indeed -- so finding them grouped so completely on this cd is refreshing. The true surprise here is that, even though the best tracks come from well before 1954, they prefigure rockabilly by many years but still sound exactly like the stuff that dominated the late fifties! Also, Chet Atkins plays lead guitar on these songs, and the recordings contain some of the best guitar licks he's ever picked.

He usually brings out the sensual and passionate moods of all his good-looking models. I was a little disappointed with this collection of color male-nude images of the \\"Boyz of Miami\\". First of all, there's not a boy in sight, most are mature men. Second, there seem to be a lack of emotion or passion in these shots. I am surprised, as he usually captures more feelings and sensuality when photographing his male models. I think it may be the angles, the choppy images, the heads cropped out, the extreme close-ups, and the bland shots of the models not knowing how to pose that leaves a lot to be desired in this collection. Heidemann has great talent, but whoever selected these images, should have left them by the wayside.

When applying this product, I look like a ghost. The product is very visible and it makes my skin appear unnaturally white.3. The product flakes off. When I apply it, the product leaves white flakes on my skin and these flakes are hard to remove from my skin and impossible to remove from my eyebrows or any hair, should I accidently get too close. In other words, the sunblock doesn't get absorbed fully into the skin.4. Applying this sunblock sometimes makes my skin turn red and stay red for a few hours.I used this product for a couple of days then threw it out, so I can't say whether or not it works. I'm currently trying other products (not neutrogena!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad reaction","review":"Add us to the list of having a bad reaction to this sunscreen. It caused a chemical type burn on my 9 year old twin daughter's faces. We just had them into the doctor. Scary scary stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oily sunblock","review":"I didn't buy this here. I bought it because I have sensitive skin and I thought this would be a great product for my face and neck, but I just ended up getting hives on my face. This stuff is kind of hard to rub in for people with darker skin tones. I have a light-medium complexion and I had to massage it in to get rid of the obvious white streaks. This sunblock made my face look super shiny as well. It looked like I was sweating or something.At first I applied this sunblock alone with no moisturizer before and then my face would break out in hives. Then I started to put moisterizer on and let the moisterizer absorb for a couple of minutes then I put the sunscreen on. Even after than I still broke out in hives. I will look for another product after this. Another downside is that it comes in a tiny tube that is about $10 where I live. I thought I was getting a quality product but I guess not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking like a red, smiley face balloon!","review":"I am a Neutrogena sunblock fan, or at least, I was before using the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry Touch, SPF-70. I had it on for less than an hour and washed it off after coming back inside, yet the skin on my face and neck became red, itchy, and then swollen, at which point the skin became numb. And yes, I had on a large hat while outside. It was nearly a month before the swelling went down (my husband said I looked like a red smiley face balloon in the meantime) and another month before the skin started to regain normalcy. I used to use their earlier SPF-55 without problems, but am apprehensive about trying it again and am now looking for another sunblock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning for acne-prone users","review":"This is a warning that the Ultra Sheer SPF 55 and higher with helioplex seems to clog pores, as opposed to Ultra Sheer SPF 45. I have used the SPF 45 version for over a year with no problems. When I switched to this product, I had several pimples the very next day, only in the area where this product was applied. Comparing the labels, the SPF 45 says \\"non-comedogenic (won't clog pores)\\", whereas the SPF 55 product does not make this claim. So if you are prone to having clogged pores, I suggest you use the Ultra Sheer SPF 45 formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stings!","review":"The protection this sunscreen gives is good and it is less greasy than many on the market (though it is thicker than the clarins I'm used to), but it really stings.

I spend top dollar on this product and I believe that the company and vendors who handle this product should offer the public who purchases this item at a substantial discount. We will be using 3 x's as much of the product as the instructions call for on the label. Until there is a product that will protect our skin from cancer, I have doubts and much fear.

It's a lot more matte than any others I've tried, including pricier ones. But it's still a bit shiny. Maybe that's due to the sunscreens so there's only so much any manufacturer can do about it. Overall, I still really like it and will probably keep buying it. It has virtually no scent, and that's also important to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Non-greasy","review":"I've used this product for over a year. I have normal skin and use glycolic acid products that don't include sunscreen. I apply this over my regular moisturizer in the morning and apply makeup over it.

I do get a little shiny in the afternoon from it, but nothing excessive. Overall great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for daily protection but not for active water use.","review":"I bought a pair of the 70 spf from Costco since I didn't like how Aloegator is bulletproof when it comes to staying on your skin (not to mention blocks your pores).I surf probably 3-4 times a week, 2 hours a piece and while I like the Neutrogena it's definitely not for active use in the water even though it claims to waterproof. Any significant rubbing (like clearing water off your face), will result in shedding the block and you'll get burned in all the rubbed off places.So for me the search continues for a good block that is durable in water yet friendly on the skin. I guess the proper thing to look for is \\"rub-proof AND waterproof\\". Don't assume just being waterproof is any sign of it sticking to your face when you need it to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Sunscreen I Use On My Face.","review":"This was suggested to me by my aunt years ago, and I have never gone back.It quickly absorbs into the skin, and the sunscreen smell dissipates as it absorbs.

The first time I applied it, I got it too close to my eye and it started stinging. I thought the stinging would stop after a little bit so I continued to apply the rest of my makeup. The stinging eventually got so bad I started crying and had to wash it off my face and start over with my makeup.That being said, after I applied it a second time (not getting anywhere near my eyes) it worked wonderfully all day at a very hot day at Six Flags.

I live in a place with fierce sunlight. And I am exceedingly pale...the only thing is, (and this is true of all sunblocks to some degree) that it does leave a shine on the face, which causes me to have to dust a wee bit of face powder over it, and I HATE MAKEUP. However, were it not for that one small flaw, I would say this is the best sunblock I have ever used; I also put it on the backs of my hands, on any exposed skin, when I venture out into the intense UV of my part of Southern California. If you perspire and it gets into your eyes, it burns like crazy, but again, protection from the sun is unequalled by any other brand. So I would get it if I wanted this total protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I'm very happy with the sunscreen, and it arrived in less time than I expected! The price was GREAT! Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again!","review":"Let me start by saying that I do not have senstitive skin. I purchased this and the first thing I noticed was an incredible stinging. I stuck with it for about two weeks, hoping that it would subside.

So I decided to purchase this after hearing fair reviews on the internet. After a month of using this, I have come to the conclusion that the product was clearly not for me. I have combination skin and it seemed like it made me much oilier towards the end of the evening compared to what I used to use. To make things worst, I smile quite often and the sun block dried and clumped into my laugh lines (it looked like fine white streaks on the side of my mouth), which became quite embarrassing.I wish this was for me; it would have saved me a pretty penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned and peeled","review":"I have used Banana Boat sport SPF 30(pump bottle) on my my daughter's body & scalp for years.

I've used many different brands and Neutrogena would be among the last I would use. The smell, even taste (probably travels through the tear ducts, while trace amounts get on the lips and in the mouth) lasts all day. I also noticed that my skin was very red, even after washing my face. Neutrogena should improve their product or take it off the market. Vanicream didn't have an offensive smell, and there are numerous alternative products that were more pleasing to use. Also consider using SPF clothing including gloves and sleeves. Even though I have been careful the last 3 years, I have just had a diagnosis of my first basil cell carcinoma. Use something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"With all that this sunblock promises, I wonder if I've got the right product. First of all, this lotion irritates my skin. My skin starts to burn, then it turns red. The redness eventually fades away. Secondly, this lotion makes my face very oily. I use oil blotting sheets to sop up the oil, and to get rid of the shine. I wonder if the effectiveness of the sunblock is reduced by my blotting.I've used Neutrogena's Visibly Firm face lotion w/spf 20, which smells nicer, is more readibly absorbed, and doesn't make my face greasy. Only thing, it costs three times as much as the Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing residue.","review":"I bought this because I trusted Neutrogena to make a good product. What I ended up with was a really disappointing. It leaves a white film that doesn't absorb and is visible, even when using small amounts. If you're a guy, it will build up around your stubble and look like you have a terrible skin condition. The worst thing is that it has a tendency to clump and become even more visible when it dries. Meaning, I have sometimes come home to find that I had been in public with white film smudged on my face from this product (though it was not that way when I applied it). Unbelievably embarrassing. I imagine that many people don't have these issues, otherwise it would not be such a popular product. But, I insist that there are much better products in this price range that are more transparent and won't leave a film.

A few months ago, I purchased 3 tubes of the 100SPF sunscreen at our local retailer because (a) it was marked $5.99 and (b) it was on sale for 25% off (they've since raised the price to $10.99). After trying it, my wife (who gardens) stated that it didn't work. I decided to test the product myself and applied a liberal amount to my face (which is very brown). After 2 hours in the pool with my 6-year-old, with minimal water contact to my face and no sweating, I came in looking like I'd been at the beach all day with no sunscreen at all - very red.

One hour prior to going outside, we applied this to the family. By the time we reached the zoo, my son was sweating lightly and had cloudy drops of sweat on his brow. 30 min later, we had a light sprinkle of rain and each drop formed a clouded polkadot on our skin. Today I tried to carefully apply it to my son's face, only to realize that any spot that wasn't thoroughly rubbed in had dried to be slightly cloudy.

I only used it occasionally as I was trying several new sunscreens because my former brand had been discontinued. Then I noticed it made my skin feel very dry once the central heat was on and the air was drier, so I put it aside until warmer weather. When I tried it again this spring, I found I had developed an allergy to it. It makes my face bright red, swollen, itchy and tender.

Sure, I burn easily, but a sunscreen should prevent it from happening.One that I've used recently that was truly waterproof was the Hawaiian Creations sunscreen. So waterproof, in fact, that it required soap to wash it off. However, I developed rashes, which is why I tried the Neutrogena. Now I have to keep looking.

The only downside, is that it doesn't fit the extra large bottles. Plus the bottles that have odd shapes don't fit in well. I would save the smaller bottles, and fill them.Another reviewer suggested using a soft scrub sponge, and cleaning the shower wall carefully to get rid of all soap scum. Let it dry, use the rubbing alcohol pad and let that dry. The wall needs to be totally dry for the strips to stick. I have a vinyl wall, that is textured, and this tip worked great.

It holds all my large shampoo and conditioner bottles, a nail brush, a bar of soap and, I have just placed the razor beside one of the bottles.It is easy to rinse out and easy to remove if I want to do a real cleaning.I have used scrubbing bubbles cleaner to clean the shower and it came out fine.I bought this because I have a large, double shower head with hose and could not use a caddy designed to hang from the shower head.

I went over the area again with alcohol just to ensure I did not touch the area where the two-way tape would be. Mounted the shelving and then took Windex to clean the pencil marks.

I recorded this movie on Beta way back when, but now the Beta machine is dead and I can't find this movie on DVD. When I first saw the movie, I told an older guy I worked with and he knew all the songs in the movie. He sang all the lyrics and knew about Harry Babbitt and Ginny Simms, et al. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys campy humor with a little bit of classic horror. You don't need explosions, killings or graphic sex to enjoy a movie (believe it or not!)

Not the best hi fi sound, but very good.The music is a light juicy of new age and sounds from hi tech machines without emotion. BT was great in the \\"Monster\\" soundtrack (far better than this one), but in this is boring and create a techno easy listening music without soul and personality. If you don't know \\"Monster\\" try this one. If you know it, so don't get \\"this binary universe\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"BT This Binary Skipping Disc","review":"BT made the stutter edit popular on some of his earliest production work. It was a fresh, cool technique when it was first introduced. On this disc, the technique is so over used that, combined with the digital noise samples, it sounds like the disc is defective when it clearly is not. The technique might have worked if it was used as a spice and not as the main dish. Who wants to dine on salt and pepper?This disc is overloaded with reverse samples and repetitious phrases.Some of the compositions, like \\"1.618\\", would have been pleasurable if it were not for the rhythm track being constructed from a myriad of digital noise and abrupt edits.A DJ does not a composer make.If you're looking for a DTS 5.1 surround mix to enjoy, try an Alan Parson's disc instead. Better music, cleaner productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Indeed, not Emotional Technology, but...","review":"I confess that I was hoping for some of the grove from Emotional Technology here and became disappointed that this is a different disc.

Say you buy a 'tea' but when you taste it, tastes like 'coke'. Oh, you bought the tea flavored coke. This is how I experienced BT's Binary Universe. I was expecting that in your face, break-beat, trance, old-school BT but this CD is definitely more ambient or house. With that being said, it is really a truly amazing CD. You won't get it the first time you listen to it, but if you listen to the CD over and over again it starts to sync-in. Some of the music is stuff you haven't heard before. Maybe in 10 years, musicians, producers will catch-up.Really enjoyed track 4 through 6. Even though those are only 3 songs, they are long and change to different styles in the middle. 6 is freaking awesome.I wanted to give it 5 stars, but because I was expecting something else, I knocked off a star. Good job though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great piece of Art","review":"If you like BT you gotta get this. I've seen it with a friend 3 times in a row while talking. Just takes you away.

'This Binary Universe' sounds more like a movie score than an artist album from one of the most highly acclaimed electronic music producers of all times.Yes I understand that movie scoring is what BT 'does' now - and that's fine. but for the love of god don't classify this as dance music and sell it under that guise. If you labeled this CD as New Age and sold it as such, I wouldn't have a problem with it.If you want essential BT, pick up IMA and ESCM. Both are absolute landmarks."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't believe the hype","review":"Up until now, I've loved just about everything BT's done. But even after several listens, I can't come to any other conclusion that this is album is pretty much just a load of crap. I find it monotonous and unimaginative.It does seem true that much time was spent tailoring every second of the entire album, but this is true of anything BT has done before. Huge attention to detail is a trademark for BT.To me, what's missing from this is the \\"big picture\\" so to speak. The album seems to have no direction, no soul, no emotion, no intention.I guess every artist is going to have a few duds in his or her career, but what bugs me about this is all the over the top accolades the album's received.I feel like we've got a case of the emperor's new clothes here, and I'm the only one thinking \\"but hes not WEARING any!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"***Wow***This***Is***Rehashed***","review":"Obviously certain BT fans have never heard of The Orb, Mouse on Mars, Autechre, Thievery Corporation, Future Sound of London, Aphex Twin, Black Dog, Plastikman, Moby, etc...

It is a great performance and to my well trained ears is adequately recorded. No, it's not a perfect recording but it sure isn't some bootleg of a dude hiding a tape recorder in his jacket in the balcony. All of the instruments are present and can be heard clearly with the drums being a bit distant in comparison to the others. It sounds like a soundboard recording and it's a great gig. If you're looking to venture into some Soft Machine live shows get Backwards and Noisette first, they are all time classics. And then, I'd actually reccommend getting this release before Virtually and maybe even Middle Earth Masters. If you love Soft Machine from this era then don't think twice this an essential slice of SM history circa 1970!

It is well researched and well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like home","review":"This book was a page turner for someone like myself. It was right on the money with how it is to grow up with a BPD mother. In a sad way it's good to know their are other grown children out there with the same experiences. Many of us do get ahead of it and survive to live quite calm and wonderfully normal lives with loving families! I found it interesting to put vocabulary to the many trademark behaviors of my mother that I had identified over the years, but just didn't have a word to use for it. If you believe your childhood was scarred by life with a BPD parent, treat yourself to this very informational book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and Irrelevent","review":"This book is hateful. Written about mental illness in the early 1980's, though, that's to be expected. The first 198 pages are spent disparaging the mother, painting all BPD patients as hopeless (maybe Larson just didn't have any success with her patients?) It's full of stereotypes. Then there are short, incredibly repeatitive chapters on how adult children should cope with their \\"waif, hermit, queen, or witch\\" mothers.Whether too permissive with her children (\\"waifs and hermits\\"), too selfish and demanding (\\"queens), or just evil (\\"witches\\"), this book tells us that ALL BPD mothers are abusive and heartless, incapable of truly loving her children, nurturing them, or protecting them emotionally. It will do nothing to mend broken relationships, and really doesn't give adult children any insight into what their mothers have to cope with every day, and as a student in mental health I didn't find it helpful at all. I'm sorry I wasted my time even picking it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"no pity: just a restraining order","review":"This book implies that people should pity people with this problem...this is just a big pharma scam to label psychopaths with something they can make money from..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on a difficult subject","review":"This is a fantastic book that describes the basic four types of BPD mothers.

Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"This author must have been hiding in our childhood home!","review":"Reading this book made me feel a part of something larger, perhaps much like those survivors of the holocaust: Only they could really know what it was like, no matter how much they tried to explain it to others. This book has let my sister and me know there are others out there who know what it was like for us. Somehow that is refreshing, letting you breathe more easily when talking or thinking about the terrors of your childhood. It was emotionally taxing, but so empowering. I do not feel the need to explore the borderline topic any further- this book says it all. Many thanks to Ms. Lawson for her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book for Survivors of Borderline Parents","review":"I bought this book at the book store and had no idea how healing it would be for me. I could not put this book down and found for the first time a book that simply acknowleged the pain and darkest despair that is felt by having a BPD mother. The difficulty with this disorder is no one really knows what it is like or believes someone could be so unpredictable and dangerous. The even sadder thing is that it messes with the thinking of each child within a family of this person and it is passed on. It is a very sick disease and I believe we need more knowlege on this subject for both children still with these parents and those of us recovering our souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable For Understanding Borderline Parents of Either Gender","review":"I agree completely with the positive reviews of this book: Christine Lawson's masterful use of Jungian archetypes is helpful beyond belief in enabling those of us who are dealing with BPD parents to understand the various forms that the disorder takes. If any mood disorder does not lend itself to a one-size-fits-all classification, it's BPD.However, for those of us who were unlucky enough to have been raised by two Borderline parents, I would like to add that Lawson's archetypes apply equally well to both genders. While reading the book, I was struck by how often I could change the pronouns and see the behaviors of both my father and my mother fall into too-vivid relief. Although there are roughly three times more female than male Borderlines, it's important to remember that there appears to be very little difference in the way that both present their disorder to those around them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This book changed my life and helped me to realize I was not the defective one.

When I read excerpts of the book to them they are in awe at the accurate depiction of the borderline mother that the author has written and has been able to capture.

I would recommend the book to anyone who has difficulties living and understanding a mother whose emotions are up and down and pushes you and others away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Effort Mistitled","review":"This is a great book, but it should have been subtitled \\"Helping Her (Adult) Children....\\" The book makes the presumption that the reader is an adult child of someone with BPD, yet it is useful in profile for people with young children who have borderline parents. Divorce, or a strong parent working with a borderline spouse are not considered in this text, which is a weakness for an otherwise highly informative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for borderline mothers","review":"I would caution all therapists NOT to recommend this book to borderline mothers. Initially, it may seem to be a tool to help them understand the experience of others who live with them. However, there is no message of hope here for a borderline parent--or, really, for the spouse of one. Instead, the experience of reading this book is very highly likely to become a very painful memory, one that, I believe, could even trigger borderline episodes. Please be extremely careful in recommending this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource on BPD","review":"I read this book from cover to cover in about a week! It was remarkable how much this book reminded me of my stepdaughter, her mother and my husband. WOW! Prior to reading this book, I'd read Stop Walking on Eggshells and I Hate You...Don't Leave Me. Both excellent books on BPD. This book gave me more insight on how this person's behavior effects the child.I was watching a bit of Mommy Dearest on TV and it dawned on me -- that this woman portrayed in the movie acted and spoke as my stepdaughter's mother! Almost verbatim -- creepy. To my surprise, when this book came, there were quotes from Christina Crawford, herself!I found the info very helpful for understanding my situation, however, I really wish there was something more about how to help children (boys and girls) cope NOW.Perhaps there can be a sequel to this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frighteningly accurate","review":"As the \\"no good\\" child of a borderline mother, this book was very helpful as well as frightening. If you are the child of a borderline, I would highly recommend that you read it in the context of therapy. It is clearly written, easily understood and to the point. However, it spends far more time defining and diagnosing than explaining how to transcend BPD challenges. Perhaps this was not the purpose. Regardless, there were a few statements about how often anxiety and depression are lifelong battles for children of borderline mothers. I haven't found this to be true on a personal level and hope others understand that the anxiety or depression felt from growing up with a borderline mother can be controlled and eradicated almost entirely. Overall a very good book, comprehensive and very accurate. I found it very helpful but had to take it in small doses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop Walking on Eggshells; Coping When Someone you Care Abon","review":"This book brought me such hope and comfort.

She also gave very good advice as to how to handle life with the BPD mother now and how to protect yourself. There was also information on how to get to know the self that was suppressed.This book was exactly what I needed.

Many striking turns of phrase are layered upon each other in this book. It is a compelling read. But a lingering question looms as the text progresses - At what point does the memoir end and dramatization begin? While I'm not implying a Carcaterra-esque fraud, the tightly constructed details of the author's early years strain credibility and inadvertantly call into question much of what is surely genuine.

All of the \\"copyright, editing, interpretive\\" justifications for this are unwitting, unrecognized traps for the author(s), who wind up simply promoting a group-aggrandizing school of false-orthodoxy. (Brothers, be kind to, and have mercy on yourselves, who so clearly hunger for experience of enduring verity.) This is not the miraculous \\"one vision\\" which flows from an understanding of ACIM. It is unfortunately the same form of sectarian divisiveness that split early Christianity itself. This wastes time, and cannot help any ACIM student."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intentions are not enough","review":"I have no problem with there being differing interpretations of ACIM. I have a big problem with the distorted and inaccurate portrayal of Wapnicks' teachings.I am not a \\"Wapnickian\\" and I also question some of what he writes. But these guys have gone so far overboard they have no credability. They have shot themselves in the foot.My understanding of the Course continues to grow. What I thought a few years ago is no longer what I think now. I hope what I think five years from now will be different. I would not say that someone's view was wrong. But I would and will say this book is intellectually dishonest and has an egoistic undertone. Don't look here to learn Wapnick's positions. Read his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder, government intrigue, renegade private eyes, and who cares?","review":"This is a murder mystery, which I usually like, but not this one. It was hard to follow and I just couldn't get interested in the characters. It is built around the sport of falconry, which might have been interesting, but wasn't.There are murders happening one after another, every possible law enforcement agency has a hand in the investigation, local militia members are possible terrorists, plus plenty of other odds and ends. Some government intrigue novels are interesting; this one not so much.I would not recommend, as I could never get interested in the story. I found I didn't even care if they escaped the big explosion at the end or not!I received a free copy of this book in exchange for writing a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starting to read just like the first one.","review":"I hope this second Frank Pavlicek book (for me) isn't an omen of the same old, same old.

From the very beginning it was not able to keep my interest. There seemed to be way too much going on that made the story line a bit difficult to follow, but really a whole lot of nothing happening throughout the story other than people being killed off.

The gist of the book is that seeking after God is the reason for our existence and for victory in our lives. It relates how we substitute other things for what is important, an intimate relationship with Almighty God. From this intimacy with God springs holiness and victory. Power is not found in religion, doctrine, knowledge or anything other than being in the presence of God."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book every Christian should read!","review":"This is one of the greatest books that I have ever read.

The essays are written by well-known historians and cover an interesting range of topics. Particularly intriguing was the essay about the decision to relocate the Confederate capital from Montgomery to Richmond. The motion just barely passed. The location of the two capitals had considerable effect on the strategy of the war and one wonders what things would have been like if the capital had remained in Alabama.

And even though we are clearly set up for books 3, 4 etc., I'd rather have mediocre Feist than no Feist at all. Feist makes Assassins a stronger book by concentrating it's limited plot line on Squire James and his Prince. Betrayal had a 'Whoo! Where did that come from.' quality that...well...betrayed the reader. Assassins is much more tightly plotted. I can see how this novel is structured after a video game: fighting in the Nighthawks underground fortress is clearly level x...but it doesn't wack you in the head with it. And, for the most part, I didn't feel I was reading something written for computer geeks who want a further game fix. So I guess I'll be waiting for book 3... Krondor, the Misdemeanor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feist continues his excellence!","review":"Feist writes another epic fantasy and proves why he is foremost among modern fantasy authors. An absorbing plot and characters that you care about make it an excellent read. It is also nice to read adventures about Jimmy the Hand, Arutha, Locklear, and the rest of the Riftwar characters again. Although Krondor the Betrayal seemed a bit mechanical, Krondor the Assassins recaptures the magic that makes his stories the most interesting on the market today.

The standard strap is too small for guys, the extension does not work very well.The display area is a tiny bit too small and it is difficult to reach e.g. skip forward/backward buttons.The plastic cover is too thick/stiff, so if you do manage to reach these buttons, you're most likely to operate the middle round button instead as it is slightly taller than the rest of the keyboard.

A man who was fundamental to building two transcontinental railroads, a major eastern railroad and the nation's premier shipyard. The book describes his achievements, failures, attributes and flaws. It also gives a vivid view of life in gold rush California and the later trials in building the Central Pacific through the Rockies. Although commissioned by the Huntington family, it seems to provide a balanced view of the man. His sometime questionable dealings are well presented, and explained within the context of a different era. If the book has a flaw, it is the very detailed explanations of the stock and bond manipulations. But overall, it is the story of one of the true builders of the 19th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Program","review":"This manual clearly maps out a program for trauma victims struggling with Substance Abuse.

In addition, there is a large amount of repitition in the book. It reads like a parenting manual, but is seemingly aimed at literate, educated people-- potentially leaving an entire population of parents out of the picture. They may get caught up in the terminology, or frustrated with unending opinions and repetition. Despite this all, it confronts valid issues surrounding the problems faced by boys (i.e shaming, self-esteem), and provides interesting anecdotes to support the author's own opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Boys: Rescuing Our Sons from the Myths if Boyhood","review":"I ordered the audiobook so that I could listen to it while I was driving. It was filled with examples of what my son has had to deal with at school. It was an opportunity for me to have an \\"insider's\\" view of what was really going on at school, how prevalent it is for this to happen to our sons, and what I could do to counter-act it with our son. The author narrated the audiobook, and gave a lot of real-world examples that he had compiled in the 20+ years he had served as a child psychologist.I would recommend this book highly to anyone having to deal with bullying and their sons at school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cheese without any crackers","review":"This 398 page book of cheese could have been easily written in about ten pages. Pollack does introduce some interesting ideas about gender-straight jacketing and the harms of the boy code. Unfortunately, he does a horrible job of making his claims believable. First, he generalizes with phrases like, \\"research shows\\". He does list his sources in the back, but there are fifteen pages of sources without any indication as to which figures go with which sources. Secondly, the stories in his book seem too cheesy to take place in real life. If you are going to write a book about real boys, one should find some real boys to base your book on, because these stories don't happen to most of us real boys out there. Overall, I would recommend that you read the epilogue, as it is a great summary and presents the only real points of this dissappointing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read about raising boys!","review":"As a mother of a teenage boy, I wish this book had been around 18 years ago. What William Pollock writes about are some of the issues my son faced while growing up. Now I know what he was going through. I wish I could turn back the clock and change the way I responded to my son- or known why he acted the way he did.This book does not negate what girls face in society - that is another book and another story. But we have to realize that not all boys are athletes and all boys have feelings. The 'Boy Code' has to go!I have recommended the book to my sister and sister-in-law for raising their boys and I intend to make sure the Superintendent of our school district will get a copy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good arguments for an interesting analysis","review":"Mr. Pollack presents a good case on the damage we as a society do to boys in raising them according to the \\"Boy Code\\" that we ourselves were raised with. Refreshingly, he also suggests ways to break through or subvert that damage in order to get our boys to trust and express their emotions. While he seems to want to blame a large variety of socialization and personality difficulties that boys and men face on this suppressed-emotion concept, he still points out that boys are indeed emotional humans that need some sort of expression to be mentally healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a counselor for emotionally disturbed teenagers I was really exited to read this book. Unfortunately, Pollock tends to point out the obvious. Yes, it is okay for boys to cry, be sure and not to call your son a \\"sissy\\", etc... This book could have been written in a five pages. Very monotonous reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Boys Need Our Help","review":"William Pollack has called us all to action to save our boys. He has researched and captured the problems that our boys face today. Read this book and hear our boys cry for help. Share these insights with your friends and family, and make a difference to help save our boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long","review":"As a teacher, I read a lot of books about education and childhood development. Real Boys is typical of most of these books in that the author takes 500-600 pages to say what he could have expressed in 100 pages. Read the first chapter and you get the point of the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coddling is not the answer","review":"This was a book I was assigned to read for a graduate level diversity class. In a group consistng of myself and three women, our opinions on specific topics in the book varied. However, we all felt that the author was telling us that we need to coddle our boys.In \\"Teachers as Cultural Workers\\"(1998), Paulo Freire discusses the differences between authoritative, authoritarian, and passive teaching, with the passive approach caused by parents and teachers \\"coddling\\" the child. Boys do need to be expressive, but not to the extent that Pollack would have.The other issue I have with the book is his noted studies. Not only is the reader left not knowing which study belongs to which statement, but also some of the studies are extremely outdated. For example, Pollack notes results of a study linking gay boys to being hereditary through a report from 1953! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A long overdue book","review":"After decades of feminist propaganda about how girls were supposedly suffering from low self-esteem, we finally learn the truth: our boys are in real trouble, and it is much more serious than how they \\"feel\\" about themselves. Pollack's work is excellent, even if he is a voice crying in the wilderness. He believes that the \\"gender straitjacket\\" was placed on boys unintentionally. I disagree: forces in government and academia have long sought to marginalize men and boys, and we see the results of their \\"work\\" all around us now. In short, what American society (especially public education) has done to boys is cruel and criminal. Pollack's work is an important step toward rescuing boys from those who deny their pain and seek to stifle their individuality and uniqueness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A walk down memory lane","review":"While I was reading this book, I felt like I was answering a lot of old questions from my past. Dr. Pollack did a wonderful job in his interviews and his examples of boys dealing with their problems. I felt like there were times when I was depressed but yet did not know it. Using Dr. Pollack's revised diagnosis measures for depression, there were in fact many times that I was depressed as a teenager. I am going to recommend this book to both men and women to show that the \\"boy code\\" can be changed if we as a society will look at boys with a different light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Found: a message; wanted: an editor","review":"All those who have complained about the book's length are right: it's at least twice as long as it needs to be.

These horrifying social visions -- essentialist, mindless, cruel -- masquerading as plain-spoken common sense are all too typical of the \\"real\\" world we needlessly bully our sons into believing is \\"the way things have to be,\\" not a singularly rigid, emotionally cold (but far from inevitable) version of \\"the way things are\\" right now. People like Pollack are potentially forces for a much-needed revolution in this country's popular understanding of the connections between biology, gender, and behavior. If you have sons, do any kind of work with boys, or were once a boy yourself, do yourself and your world a favor and read (or at least skim!) this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rereading Real Boys","review":"As a father of one son in 1999, I initially read Real Boys, and was extremely moved, both at the insights to my life and to how to help my son. How many times has my wife or mother, sensing something wrong with me, asked 'what's going on?' My refrain, constantly, is 'not much'. How much better a platform for conversation is it to shoot hoops with me, or prune the roses, or clean the garage?Now in 2005 I have two sons and a daughter, and I thought it was an appropriate time to re-read the book. My oldest son is in school, playing sports, and starting to eschew all feminine. Last night I curled on the couch in the semidarkness and began the book. Tears streamed down my face for much of the first couple of chapters. Toward the end of the evening, my wife walked down the hallway toward me. Before she got there, I wiped any tears from eyes and cheeks and got ready to respond to her throw away question 'what's up' with my 'not much.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read For All Parents of Boys!","review":"\\"Real Boys\\" was a great eye opener for me. As the mom to two young boys, I found myself all too often subjecting my sons to the myth that boys must be masculine and aggressive and anything otherwise is wrong. Dr. Pollack clearly showed me the error of my ways!This is a great book for parents of boys. I especially got great satisfaction from reading the chapter entitled \\"The Power of Mothers\\". In it, Pollack states, \\"...by empowering the mother you empower the son.\\" How simple yet how powerful a statement. I am host of the Sons Channel at Bella Online, and I can't begin to tell you how many letters and emails I get from my readers - mothers - who want to know the best way they can raise their sons into good, upstanding men. Now, after reading Dr. Pollack's book, I can readily tell them it is all within their grasp - that a mother's love for her son creates a self confident, caring and sensitive man.Christine Clark sons@bellaonline.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but misses one major point.","review":"The \\"Boy Code\\" and the idea that \\"boys must be toughened up\\" has existed for generations. But, in the past, there was a reason for this. As a young man in the 30s, it was explained to me in this manner. I had to prepare myself for entry into the world where I would be responsible for a family and their well being. Such a life would lead to many encounters requiring decisions. When emotions take over, reason goes out the window. Therefore I must learn to surpress my emotions and control them. When there is a reason for \\"toughing up\\" the process can be endured with little problem. But today, the reson no longer exists. Boys and girls are taught that women will stand on their own requiring no help from a man. As a result, the procces of \\"toughening up\\" becomes a meaningless tourture endured without reason.(wish you had a spell-check with this.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"I purchased this book because I loved Reviving Ophelia. This book is an absolute waste of money. First of all, it is difficult to read. Second, I don't agree with the conclusions of the authors. Third, it is boring. I read Reviving Ophelia in less than a week. Real Boys has been on my nightstand for three months, still only 1/4 finished. Meanwhile, I have finished at least 10 other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignores the trauma of circumcision","review":"I find it amusing that Dr. Pollack can write with such passion about the trauma that a boy feels when separated from his mother on the first day of kindergarten but completely ignore the incredible trauma of ritual genital mutilation performed without anesthetic on millions of boys every year. If an adult male wants to cut off part of his penis because of unproven health reasons or irrational religious convictions, that's his choice. But the circumcision of a child (male or female) is child abuse, plain and simple, and any book about children that fails to point this out is hypocritical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaming the cultural elite?","review":"I felt this book, unlike its subject, was neither controversial nor interesting enough to merit much discussion. I agree with the other reader from Seattle that Pollack contradicts himself on a number of counts. But I do have to wonder about this man-hating cultural elite described by the Washington reader. There's no question that there's been a recent gynocentric trend in literature, academia, etc. But who is driving this trend? The cultural elite is largely made up of men- male writers, professors, entrepreneurs. Is this trend not only man-hating, but self-hating as well? It seems simplistic and just plain silly to blame the struggles of today's young men on an evil cultural elite and the degeneration of paternal presence in the home. The members of this supposed cultural elite grew up in a time when papas were far more likely to stay married to mamas. But just look how they turned out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the biggest piece of nonsense I have ever read!","review":"The author's research is just a little too \\"convienient\\" if you know what I mean. I'd like to see the original reports of his \\"studies\\". This book is so depressing, it basically says (forgive my bluntness) \\"you girls are lucky, it sucks to be a boy\\".

The correct name is Texas Southern University. As the album cover implies, this CD is horn heavy. If you have ever heard \\"Tighten Up\\" by Archie Bell and the Drells, this was the band that played behind him during the recording.

To be even safer, walk flat-footed on your Spiky Pluses!The newer kind of traction aids, with the small steel rings strung along wires, is no good at all for black ice or smooth ice - the rings just skid on it - and if you wear that kind inside just to stop in a store for a minute you can slip on the floor.

His cast of characters sounds interesting, a marginal repo man, Yakuza, a NSA super-SWAT women (yes NSA, the author doesn't know any better) and various others. But to my mind the characters just didn't come together to build an engrossing tale. I was able to put the book down for days at a time come back to it and read a few of the very short chapters, then put it down again. It took me over a month to read and that's unusual.

I was only seeking one of the selections on the CD the clerk at Georges introduced me to all the other selections some of which I already had on other CD's which took a long time to find and at great exppense. With Smooth Grooves I have all the great steppers songs on ONE CD....my steppin parties will never be the same! This is a excellent CD get it while you still can!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me Brain Dead...","review":"I just didn't get this book. Never really seemed to go anywhere.

Yes, in a few days (about 10-14 or so) in the right light, my facial hair can look a little 'brassy' in color but the light has to be just right (or wrong?).

You can crop and adjust for macro with a telephoto lens you already own and add a \\"fisheye\\" look in photoshop.

There are threads on it for another attachment or lens cap, but I don't see why it would need to slide. Also, I am not fond if the \\"lens cap\\" provided. It always falls off in the bag, and it made from flimsy rubber, and with the sliding end piece I mentioned before, it can be a pain getting it to stay on.The macro function is cool, and although I still prefer my 50mm macro for close-ups, it has a neat way to show a wide angle with a close focal point. Not sure if this feature is available or works as well on cheaper attachments.One other thing to consider is that since this attaches to the end of an existing lens, it might be hard to pack in your camera bag as it is NOT convenient to screw/unscrew for each use."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not work","review":"I picked out two wide angle lenses for my wife's birthday for her Canon Eos 1000D XL SLR camera!

I very much enjoyed this book because race was not the driving force behind the romance. This book was closer to the type of relationship and life my husband and I share. It seems to me that this story was truer to the romance genre in that it's focus was on a man and a woman placed in an intense situation and who happened to be extremely attracted to each other.

I get it that Jillian and Harrison were hot for each other but I am sure the word \\"smolder\\" has some synonyms.And then there was the fact that people were always screaming at each other in this book. Characters didn't talk, reply, or just say things to each other. No, they would \\"practically scream\\" or \\"rage\\" or \\"roar\\".I was also turned off by the weird malapropisms.

The songs have a \\"tinny\\" sound and at times the snare drum and tambourine seem to overpower the vocals.

But is it true?I viewed the track list and my absolute favorite Monkees song of all time is nowhere to be found. Sure, some great ones like Auntie Griselda and others you don't hear much, even on oldies stations, were there, but not Zilch. I mean, come on! Early Monkees music without Bob Dobalena?

The one and only problem I encountered was the packaging. The jewel cases are not glued very well at all, and will fall out when you attempt to take the Cd's out.

The texture was OK; I didn't have any problems with getting the crust to brown, or it being soggy in the middle. The problem was the taste, which I found somewhat reminiscent of bisquick. This stuff just doesn't taste like pizzeria pizza crust, not even close. Looking at the ingredient list I guess it should come as no surprise, since it contains egg, soy, and milk!My suggestion if you want a quick and easy homemade pizza crust without having to make the dough a day in advance, get someFleischmann's Pizza Yeastand follow the recipe on the packet (Amazon's price is ridiculously high, check your local supermarket instead). It's almost as fast to make as the Betty Crocker mix (a few minutes of kneading is required), but the resulting crust is much better. I made one of each on the same night, and the Fleischmann's crust was the unanimous winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry not feeling the love with this crust mix","review":"So many strong reviews that I decided to give Betty Crocker a try.

Just add water and you're ready to go! We use the Coleman folding oven and our camp stove to cook them. The dough is very versatile. We use one package per person and we each add our own favorite toppings. It's awesome!! Too bad I can't buy them in my own grocery store. I like them so much I order them from Amazon by the case! I use small pizza pans when I cook them, but if you make the crust thick enough you probably wouldn't need a pan. I also have the pizza pan that you can use over a fire, but I haven't tried it with this dough yet. Anyone else? I made up Pizza making baskets for Christmas presents using this dough and it was a big hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work out at all well for my family","review":"This makes possibly the worst pizza crust I've ever served my family.

I was truly disappointed by the sound of this - it is the aural equivalent of mud and cotton, very mushy, hard to make out the details, and not something I really want to deal with. The conducting seems particularly heavy handed, as if the conductor wanted to make a name for himself by making his own slight alterations to the piece that, while not significant, are unnecessary and very irritating. Poor recording technique and a wierd performance, but wait! There's a warning on the label that the cannons are very loud!! Oh my, then this MUST be the recording to get to show off a [amt.] stereo in the bachelor pad - maybe the cannons will be so loud that your date will hop right into your lap!This is to classical music what a primer-grey muscle car is to a show of luxury automobiles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there someone conducting?","review":"I think the whole orchestra was sleeping during the recording of this 1812.

This CD is in 1998-99 recorded (and a DSD-Recording!), but sounded like 60 years ago ...

Nothing works. It is just so vacuumed tight that I simply cannot get it open."},{"rating":"2","title":"great thermos","review":"I really like this thermos. I bring soup to work and it stays piping hot. I hand wash it, and put hot water in it before I put my soup in. I have also used it for coffee, spaghetti, and other casseroles and they all stay hot for me. I did drop it without the top part screwed on and the plastic piece that you first screw on broke and I needed to get a new one. It slipped out of my hands onto my hard ceramic tile floor, so completley my fault, but that first screw on piece is not as sturdy. I also notice the rubber seal has be be well in place and the cap screwed on very tight for things to stay hot. Just once in about 100 uses my spaghetti was not hot, but I didn't have the cap screwed on tight, and did not have the thermos filled to the top. But this has been wonderful to bring to my office on the days I don't want to eat in the break room, or heat my food up somewhere else. I usually fill it at 6am and eat around noon and things remain hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after less than a year","review":"This food jar worked great at the beginning, but last night I ran a side by side test of this food jar and a newer (& slightly larger one by Stanley). At 10:00 p.m. I put water that measured 204 degrees with a Thermapen instant-read thermometer and in both jars and sealed each tightly. At 9 a.m. (11 hours later) the temperatures read:1. Smaller food jar - 69 degrees, i.e., room temperature2. Larger, newer jar - 148 degrees, still above the \\"danger zone\\" for foods.These jars are supposed to keep food hot for 15 hours. So while I would trust the newer one for food heated in the morning to still be hot at lunchtime, the smaller one has to be trashed, which is too bad, because it's the perfect size for a side of soup, easy to clean, and the overlid functions as a bowl and is a good size for either sipping or for eating from with a spoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Bottle; Stanley = No Warranty","review":"I bought this Stanley food jar in order to bring hot soup to work. As recommended, I conditioned it daily with hot water prior to filling it with soup, but in less than one week it would no longer keep the soup hot longer than one hour. I emailed Stanley regarding their \\"Lifetime Warranty\\" - I received an automated response stating they would get back with me. I've waited two weeks, still no response. Returning the bottle to Amazon makes no sense considering postage and Amazon's restocking fee.

Now, I have so many more options! I can take soup, chili, spaghetti, cold salads, yogurt, etc! However, the product works much better for soups than it does for anything else. Soups and liquids stay steaming hot (I actually burned my mouth the first day I used the product) for an extended period of time. Pastas stay hot enough, but not piping hot. Also, food on the bottom tends to be much warmer. Since you pour from the top, though, your last bite is actually hotter than your first, which is kinda weird.

Gets worse rapidly. The gasket material in the lid is prone to grab, wrinkle and abrade instead of form a decent seal with the body.(2) After about a year the insulation failed. It was immediate and dramatic. The whole exterior surface would get warm when hot liquid was added, and the whole thing (inside and out) would be tepid 40 minutes later.(3) Even before the failure the thermal performance was mediocre at best. Hot food/beverage did not stay hot nearly as well as it should.Newer is not better. Find a used thermos from the time period 1970-1990. These were more likely to be manufactured honestly, instead of what we have now: designed for rapid repurchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps things hot!","review":"It really works very well! I poured boiling water in it five hours ago and when I opened it up again, the steam fogged up my glasses. Nice!My only problem is the difficulty in opening. I'm a 22-year-old female with stick arms so that's probably why opening it is a bit of a struggle. That's why I took off one star. I don't have this problem opening my Nissan Thermos bottle.

YES it may be indestructible however threading the top on (which we likely all do in a hurry) is pretty tough.

I wanted to make sure I wasn't making it leak by rushing. Anyhow, I really like the style - and how it feels. However it leaks!

I love the wide mouth - so easy to fill, & the fact that I can fill it with something hot at 8:00 a.m. & it will still be steaming when I pour it at 2:00 p.m. Always preheat it 1st & your food WILL stay HOT. I have never actually used it for anything cold. I was unable to find one in the store & was very happy to see that I could order it from Amazon. I think it's the greatest!!

Thought it was great. Around the same time I noticed Stanley's website with all the testimonials claiming that owning one of their pieces was better even than having a dog.After 8 or 10 uses soup left in a hot car would run boiling hot to lukewarm in less than 4 hours. Had to go back to the books on that one. Made sure I was prepping it with the boiling water and filling it all the way full, yada-yada. No use.When I e-mailed Stanley about the problem there was a new one on my doorstep in a matter of days. Hey, I admire a no-BS return policy but when it's the same piece of junk you just end up hoping it will fit in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made-in-China garbage","review":"I bought three of these, one for tea, one for soup, and one extra. They sometimes work fine if you baby them, sometimes not if the gasket falls out as I explain below. The one for tea fell about a foot and a half out of my locker to the floor. Since that fall the unit is useless. I cannot hear anything rattling inside, but the vacuum seal is certainly broken. If something is going to break that easily, as other reviewers have also complained, it should not be so highly priced. Also there is a white plastic gasket between the bottle and the lid. Often the gasket will fall out when the lid is screwed on. There is no way to check, but when it falls out into the liquid inside, the food loses heat fairly rapidly. I can get much less expensive vacuum bottles that will break just like this one so why should I pay more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thermos EVER","review":"Keeps your food hot FOREVER.

If you loved Downton Abbey and like a bit of mystery, then you will really enjoy this production. The theme tune and incidental music are by the same composer as Downton (John Lunn). The only shame is the price for a season pass of SD quality. You can buy the Bluray disk from amazon.co.uk for less than the season pass in standard definition.

However, it is the most sloppy textbook I have ever dealt with. It is so cryptical and convoluted, it actually makes the material HARDER to learn. (For example, bizarre acronyms are introduced in the answers to sample problems that are never even been discussed in the text itself.) The different sections of the book refer you back and forth to one another without explaining anything in a basic way. In addition, the index is terrible, so you can't even try to dope things out on your own. I would advise you to not get this book if you can avoid it, especially if you are a student trying to learn this material for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource!","review":"I purchased this book as an adjunct to my required textbooks for anatomy and physiology class for CRNAs.

You are better off with a BRS series or Lippincott's Pathophysiology. Unless of course you feel the need to be lost in unnecessarily dense material, then by all means this is the book for you. I am sure there are merits to this text, but as a medical student and not a pulmonologist, I fear I am simply blind to them at this point. I hope for the student's at LSU sake that this guy is a better lecturer then writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dozens of typos in the Kindle version","review":"Dozens in just the two chapters I have covered so far. Essentially any formula that is inline with the text of a paragraph has errors. Many times it is a minus sign replaced by an equal sign. Capitalization in formulas is also problematic, e.g., showing Pa for \\"alveolar pressure\\" instead of PA, which is standard convention. Someone using the text as a quick review might be able to get by, but for a first exposure to the material this would be crippling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hacker History, for the Unenlightened","review":"As others have mentioned in their reviews, this book was written by a highly academic author. Thus, the content is geared towards a college educated audience, or at least bright highschool students. As a computer engineering student, I found this book to be intruiging. Several hacking related movies were analyzed, and although slightly dated, these examples further the understanding of hacking history. The anecdotes are often amusing, and the main points of each section are deeply supported with sources and logical reasoning. Thomas's overlying message is that the media cruelly slants the image of the benevolent hacker into one of a violent evil genius. I'd recommend this book to anyone above average computer user level, or those who have an interest in learning about computer history, and hackers in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tourist's view of hacker culture","review":"This is a generally terrible discourse on hacker culture. Interpretations are often misguided. Academic discussions are pretty obtuse. For a book that appears to claim that hackers are not criminals, it certainly spends a lot of time talking about how hackers are criminals. The only part of the book that's useful and interesting is the history of hacking. However, these gems are few and far in between and could have been condensed to less than a dozen pages. This leaves over 200 pages of what amounts to a nark trying very hard to not sound like a nark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid Prose Masks Any Thesis","review":"... It reads like the worst of academic tomes, using $10 words when a nickel one would have done. And while there are anecdotes and tales that are amusing, the reading was too painful.

This isn't only because Windfuhr is a superb conductor; it's also because Botstein plays this music like anything but the cosmic work that it is.Windfuhr's Die Liebe der Danae combines the cosmic Strauss Bohm Elektra, with the etherial Strauss Bohm Capriccio, with the ecstatic Strauss Sawallisch Intermezzo, all together in one astounding work of art: the culmination of Strauss and of all musical art.

It was very appealing to see how the story might continue after the end of the television show. And, to Nancy Holder's credit, the characters' voices and mannerisms are vintage Buffy. Unfortunately, the characters don't really grow and develop much and the plot is a disjointed, non-credible mess, in which things happen to the relatively passive and hapless characters. All of that might have been tolerable, if a bit disappointing, but for the ending. . .which can only be described as bizarre, bewildering, and generally god-awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"this book is a good tie in with the show.the only this that it jumps around alot,but it's still well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad Writing","review":"I bought this book because I was intrigued about telling a story that took place after the show had ended. All I can say is, the writing is horrible and resembles nothing of the Buffy characters and world. Much of the dialogue is corny and no character would be caught dead saying it, and being as the smart dialogue of the characters is one of the things that attracted me to the show, I must warn people to be wary before purchasing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queen of the Slayers","review":"I thought that this was a really great book . A lot of characters that used to be on buffy (Oz, Tara, Anya, and many others)and on Angel (Angel, Spike, Gunn, and Fred/Illyria) were mentioned. The book started out right where the series finale of buffy ended. I thought that was good. In one part of the book Andrew goes to L.A. to pick up the crazy slayer Dana (like in the Angel season 5 episode \\"Damage\\"). And later on in the book, buffy goes dancing with the Immortal and eventually she finds out that Angel and Spike came to Rome to see her (like in the Angel season 5 episode \\"The Girl in Question\\"). All of that is really great, but the ending is the best part. It is incredible. I think you should definitely buy this book. It is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What Was Hoped For","review":"The best that could be said about this book is that it takes the story line beyond the end of both series. Don't look for any real closure on the Angel/Buffy/Spike triangle or even any REAL answers as to just what takes place in that famous alley after Angel says, \\"Lets go to work!\\" It just isn't here. Hopefully, however, this WILL mark a trend as to future books, taking us beyond Sunnydale and Los Angeles. It would be nice also to hope that sometime in the future, SOMEBODY begins to write something for the ADULT fans of Buffy and Angel, and I don't necessarily mean R rated stories, just ADULT themes written from an adult's prospective."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment!","review":"I was really bummed out when Buffy ended, but even more so when I read this book. Not because of any sad ending, but the bad story. The idea was good, but it was executed poorly by the writer. Not the witty dialog from the show, nor the intriguing storline was in this one. I have to say I was greatly disapointed. I found myself skipping pages and bored. The immortal was lame. The mention of Spike and Angel was o.k. The only good that came out of this is the hope that maybe more Buffy AND Angel books will be written taking place after Sunnydale and L.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bad fan fiction","review":"This is just bad.

The chicago hellmouth was well done, as were some other things. But OMG the ending was forced. I have no idea to even begin explaining how bad it was.The spirits of Angel, spike, illyria, and gunn were transported by the powers that be to help Buffy save the world by making a child that what? sucks up all evil? and then leaves them to die? the slayers obviously should have stopped whatever the apocalypse was and then went to LA to save angel and co.god the end was a cop out. only buy this book used. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time.","review":"This should have been a much better book. It is actually pretty good for the first 2/3 of it. Then everything very quickly goes to hell. The last 1/3 is a convoluted mess of attempting to tie up plots and multiple story arcs in a vain attempt to make it seem like everything was important to the overall book. Really, I have seen better pacing in blogs. Hopefully, the reactions to this are so bad that it ends up getting dropped from the Buffyverse continuality. I hope it is all a bad dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Just finished reading this book and it was great.

Born in 1980, she is divorced, a mother, a poet, and unemployed. At the Unemployment Office where she receives her weekly allowance she is given an address she is to report to that night. When she returns to her apartment, she discovers a large sum of money has been deposited into her account.She goes to the address on the paper, and finds it is a large mansion. Inside, the same lady at the Unemployment Office greets her, along with a Professor of Psychology. The two give her an injection that enables her to travel, unaided, through time. While attempting to escape, she unwillingly moves into the future, winding up some four thousand years later - in a world where humanity is dominated by intelligent machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating historical tour with a unique story approach","review":"A thoroughly entertaining and enlightening perspective on the evolution of our social and personal environment --- famliy, government, sex, religion...Much in the vein of Michener, but with a unique storytelling approach. The book follows the history a family (that is, the same INDIVIDUALS) as they are placed episodically in ten \\"golden ages\\".It's chocked full of interesting insights into the times of each age, while at the same time developing a set of consistent personalized characters that the reader can embrace.Looking forward to the next of the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only half a book","review":"This is a fragment of a book. While it is well written, has good characters and some very interesting concepts, it fails for lack of a plot. The story seems to stop right when it should just be getting interesting. This is a pity since everything else was in place to make it a truly good book. I was very frustrated and disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a Sequel","review":"This is a fascinating sci-fi novel about two very different worlds that have mysterious connections to each other.

Quite well done, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large towel, poor construction","review":"I was looking for a large hooded towel to dry my large baby/toddler. This was about the only one I could find online at the time, so I ordered it. It arrived very nicely packaged with tight stiching to keep it together. Even though I very carefully undid the stitching, the towel unraveled in many places after only one wash. Furthermore, the hood has a padded area that makes it very cumbersome to wear (falling over his face) as he comes out of the bath. A large adult towel would do a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have","review":"it is a must-have book for those working in the field of language.

If you like theory (and, I believe, you ought to like theory and have a decent grounding in it to do any sort of well-informed practice), this is a good broad approach to it.I know some reviews say that this isn't a great update from the 2nd edition. I can't speak to that - I only saw the 3rd. As a whole text, it is useful. Not every page will drop earth-shattering revelations, of course.It is a collection of essays by different authors and thus isn't overly cohesive. It's really more of a reader and collection of essays than a fully-bound and comprehensive book.

Of those books, there have been a number of rereleases. What is annoying is that alot of romance writers are doing this, and their material is not always as good as the current price of a paperback. If a book was released in 1983 the price of the paperback should be lower, and the cover of the paperback should also have an indication that this book has just been rereleased with the current content untouched. I'm from Ottawa, Canada and this paperback was very expensive. Alot of money for an outdated storyline and not much of a story to tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"CARPENTER'S LADY is a disappointment from the second chapter on (the first chapter was promising). Obviously, the publisher wants to cash in on Delinsky's name. Reprinting this lackluster, outdated category romance (an old Sihouette Special Edition, originally published under the pseudonym Billie Douglass) isn't going to earn any new fans for the author though. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cashing in on a name...","review":"I agree with the other reviewers--save your money, before it is too late! I, too, saw it at the discount store and bought it before I read the fine print (i.e., when it was first published). It is a very weak story, filled with early-80's-type references and all the weaknesses of romances of that era. Do yourself a favor, watch these reprints carefully, and stick to Delinsky of the last ten years or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"I heartily agree with the other reviewers. Picked this up on a whim at the grocery store and should have read the reviews first. I too overlooked the first page, which indicated the original release of 1983. It was a typical 1980s romance - forced advances with no build up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tsk, Tsk, Tsk","review":"This is not the Barbara we have come to know and love. This is Barbara cira 1983. I should have been smart enough to read the publisher's page. Obviously, in 1983 the term \\"make them wait\\" was ignored. When this consumate professional builder fell into her arms in the second chapter, I put the book down. Come on, puhleeze. This gives men a bad name,(although I'm not a man). No professional coming over to look at a job, which he has heartily refused, would be so sappy as to subcumb to his desires so quickly. Where was the build? Where was the mystery? I just shake my head. From now on, I'll read the publisher's page first, thank you for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steeple-Chase Romance","review":"This book was indeed a quickie, in more ways than one. First of all, the romance came together too quickly. Chapter two ceased the intensity of the infatuation stage when the two characters were already touching. BORING. Not that touching is boring, but when you read a romance novel, you like a little bit of anticipation and challenge between your characters. Secondly, I would liked to have read more about Graham and his relationship with his long lost daughter. Seems that the plot was quickly thrown in at the last minute and wasn't very interesting to read. Tug at my heart strings with rekindled love, between family or intimates, and give me an ending that will make me sigh. Don't get me wrong, the story was cute, but I think most romance readers like a little temptation and saavy, not a steeple-chased love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book - not up to Delinsky standards","review":"I have enjoyed Barbara Delinsky's books but not this one. It was bad. Really bad. I found myself skipping every other page and then reading every third page until I skimmed through the rest. The characters are thinly drawn. Their \\"hidden\\" pasts are not that interesting. The male and female lead characters were too good to be true, as were the rest of the supporting characters.I was thoroughly bored and hated this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Delinsky Success!","review":"\\"The Carpenter's Lady\\" was a quick read; a story that flows well; interesting characters both struggling not to give in and yearning for someone to trust with their secrets. I liked it, although it's not as intriguing as Delinsky's \\"Coast Road.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of even the OLD Barbara Delinsky!","review":"I am a Barbara Delinsky fan, let me begin with that. Clearly her later works are more well developed and thorough. However, for light quick reading I have enjoyed books such as Fast Courting and Montana Man. Therefore, I thought I would give Carpenter's Lady a try.I found the book incredibly boring. The characters simply did not hold me interests, nor did the story line. It was a bit of a chore to get through.That being said, I remain a huge fan. Given the number of books she has put out, not caring for just 1 is still very, very good odds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading, don't buy it!!

I have NEVER in my entire life heard anything like his vocals onBurning BridgesandWhen Everything Falls- yeah, I've heard lots of vocalists, lots of \\"screamers,\\" but Ryan has a unique quality to his voice that I've never heard replicated nor perfectly described. Check out the first two minutes of \\"Substance\\" fromBurning Bridgesand I think you'll know what I mean.

If you took every single and bside song by them and put it all together, that would be their greatest album. But for now we have to settle with the Woodson/RLD compilation, still very much worth the buy. This CD allows you to hear both the whiny and wussy styles of GUK at their best. The Woodson songs are similar to those of Four Minute Mile and the RLD songs are similar to those of Something to Write Home About. This CD would make a good album if it had some more songs to it. My favorite songs are any of them involving Massachusetts and Forgive and Forget. So if you're a GUK fan and don't have Woodson or the Red Letter Day Single then definitely get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One helluva CD","review":"A while back on a message board that I frequent, I remember hearing quite a bit about The Get Up Kids and the emo style of music. I was hearing nothing but good things about these guys, so I picked up this CD the other day to give 'em a try. I must say, I was impressed. I generally like heavier music, but I'm open to different things--and this is different. The songs are, for the mostpart, softer and sometimes slow, but this is still a great CD for almost any music fan.If you like emo, or want to try it, pick up this CD. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want my money back","review":"Wish I had liked it, I really do. I just could not relate with the author at all.

I totally expected to love this book based on the fact that I have liked Dr. Ben Lerner's books.I've never returned anything to Amazon before, but I'm planning to return this one. I will never refer to it nor will I recommend to any of my friends or clients.By the way, to the moms out there who are at their wits end like I was...

I am so glad Amazon decided to release Crystal's brilliant earlier works like this one. This album like many Crystal offerings features songs and messages about the Gospel in clarity. I am very proud of how Crystal always, from day one in the 1980's to now, makes it a priority to sing about the love and sacrifice of Jesus and of the huge benefit they are to the listener.

The recordings of the Strauss and Vaughan Williams on this disc are laughable. It would help if she could even get all the right notes (she doesn't) or play with any sense of phrasing (she doesn't), or in tune (she doesn't), I mean, take it from an oboe player, listen to the Schickele and then put the CD back in the case. If you want a real recording of the Strauss, check out the recent recordings by Richard Woodhams or Alex Klein, or of course the famous DeLancie recording, all are excellent (especially the Woodhams)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great record from these guys","review":"Closure is a very diverse record. There are tracks that old fans will love (Destruction) as well as some very moody trip hop stuff (Born On A Ray Of Sound). A dancefloor hit (Reasons) and one excellent PJ Harvey cover (The River).

The boy who can do nothing right (funny in the original) here seems like running commentary on the stupidity of African-Americans. My daughter, who remembered loving this book as a child, ordered it for her young cousins as a gift, but once she saw it, she said, \\"Mom, we can't send this to them. It's so racist!\\" And I had to agree. Amazon should see if they can get the other edition, rather than this one, which should be permanently retired."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sending it back!","review":"My mother has enjoyed reading a retold version of this story, That Noodlehead Epaminondis edited by Eve Merriam, for many years to her students and to my children. Her copy has become so worn that she wanted to replace it. When we couldn't find it I ordered this original tale as a gift for her. Thankfully I looked at it before I wrapped it up! I would not allow my multi-racial daughter to even see the illustrations! This book is full of racially insensitive, negative stereotypes typical of the era in which it was written, but completely inappropriate for this day and age. I cannot believe it is still on the market! I now have a greater appreciation for the wonderful job that Eve Miriam did in retelling this story in a wonderful, appropriate format. I will continue to search for a copy of That Noodlehead Epaminondis."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ugly Brutal Story","review":"This is the story of a [handicapped] black kid, who is not only stupid, but cruel. He brutally drowns a puppy in the course of the book. My mother showed me this book around 1950 when I was eight years old. It made a very deep impression on me, and helped me realize the obstacles I would have to overcome in life. For me, it was a helpful dose of reality. Scared me half to death, but made me realize that as a black kid I had a heavy cross to bear and that I would have to earn self-respect where others might take it for granted."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Egregious Form of Racism","review":"Reading some of the other reviews on this page shocked me. Turn the title around, and you find the \\"moral\\" of this book: Sadnonimape, which looks conspicuously like 'Sad No-name Ape'. This isn't a coincidence, and nearly drowning a puppy because you're trying to 'cool it before carrying it home' is not typical childish ineptitude. This book is racist to its core. The writing, the pictures, all convey derogatory stereotypes of black people. Anyone who does not understand these things has not fully recognized his or her own subscription to these stereotypes. I doubt anyone still says \\"My laws a-massy!\\". Please keep this book away from children. As a reminder of this country's shamefully racist past, this book succeeds, but any argument that calls this book benign forgets that before burning a cross on someone's lawn, you have to do the subversive, yet sometimes seemingly innocuous work of reducing that person to a stereotype such as that presented in Epaminondas."},{"rating":"1","title":"love silver","review":"This necklace is beautiful!

The copy I received has 1993 and 1998 copyrights, so despite the tag \\"Revised Edition\\" on the front, it is not a recent revision. That makes all the difference in the world when you are writing about the topic of travel safety. Because this book was revised several years prior to Sept. 11, 2001, a great deal of the information is out of date and useless. I found myself not trusting anything in the book. I was disappointed in The Safe Travel Book not only because of its outdated information, but also because it seems aimed at executives and diplomats rather than the average traveler. In addition, the presentation is dry. I found myself skimming the pages rather than reading them.My recommendation to the author would be another revision, which I hope is in the works. And a few personal stories would liven up the material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lil extra glossy","review":"Dimensions exact and shipping on time.

Claudia Heuermann is essentially the star of her little film. She relegates Zorn, his music, and the Downtown New York milieu to the sidelines so she can muse droningly about the art of filmmaking and how important she is to the process that's supposed to be happening here. Each time this film shows some potential to give us some depth -- through the music if not its evasive subject's own words -- it fails, drifting off to another of Heuermann's musings about film and, less often, Zorn. There are dozens of prime concert clips, interview fragments, and other teasers in this film, but they are simply left as that: teasers, reminding us briefly that the subject is supposed to be Zorn and not the director. Now someone needs to come along and *really* make a film about this misunderstood genius, Zorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"Considering the tiny amount of live footage and interviews that are available of Zorn, this is defiantly worth getting if you're a fanAs far as documentary filmmaking goes this is sub par at best, and is defiantly not worthy of tzadiks reputationEveryone you expect is here -Patton, Masada, naked city, marc ribot-But not one interview with anyone! which is pretty disappointingInstead the filmmaker spends an exuberant amount of time talking about herself, the editing prosess and how Zorn's music has changed her life blah blah blah..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The kind of documentary you rarely see","review":"This documentary is kind of unique. It is as much about its maker than it is about its subject. This approach is a problematic one if you expect as much information about Zorn as you can get. Instead you get '12 short stories about John Zorn,' looked through film-makers personal prism. It is annoying, but at the end you want to start from the beginning (at least I did). Now, what did you expect, this is Zorn we're talking about - can you even imagine a normal documentary about this genius madman?I bought the video in the first place to see Masada Quartet. I had no idea how did this band looked like in action but I wanted to find out. Now I know, and I'm grateful for that, as the relatively short clips of Masada rehearsing and performing were truly fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe Next Time","review":"Besides one dimensional characters and a contrived plot, the author exhibits a strange fetish for dashes. The must be a hundred of them in the first 50 pages. What happened to the more appropriate comma? The editor and proofreader have much to answer for also.

From a song that was scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper inside an old church organ to a melody that stopped gunfire during the Korean War, we see the power of music through this simple holiday carol. Beautifully illustrated, and a wonderful lesson to read aloud."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazingly well done set of books to describe the US Navy","review":"Dr. Morison was an outstanding historian and a wonderful writer. I think all of the series 14 history books (and 1 book given as a general index) are intimate and readable and bring the tragedies and victories and good and bad happenings with an intensity that brings WW II back to life. Americans who want to learn about sacrifices made by the men of our Navy should read at a minimum book V,\\"The Struggle for Guadalcanal\\". Between August 9 and November 30 there were 6 full scale naval actions, and we got the worst of several of them. But somehow our men held on and ultimately won the campaign. These books have my strongest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Magnificent History of Great Achievements","review":"Morison was the last historian to write with exclamation points. Noting that the Japanese had already picked a new name for Midway Island--\\"Glorious Fourth of June\\"--he adds, \\"And so it was, but not for them!\\"Despite its length, this history is a survey; many entire books have been written about events (Coral Sea, Midway, Leyte Gulf) that are of necessity only chapters in Morison's narrative. And the author wrote at a time when many of the most salient facts, in particular that the Allies had broken the German and Japanese codes, were still closely-held secrets. Still, this is a great story, told by someone who was there--not everywhere, of course, but close enough to events that the author wrote with authenticity as well as authority.And, amazingly, still in print."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive history...Excellent and Thurough","review":"For anyone interested in the History of the Us Navy or in World War 2, this is the set to read. No battle is left out. His Writing style is in deoth and entertaining. Also it is a great resource for facts and figueres. You can't be a WW2 buff without these volumes on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded but not comprehensive","review":"One might wonder how a set of volumes of this size can be lacking in important details, but it must be remembered just how all encompassingWWII really was. Often the various episodes Morison describes are misleadingly brief. His account of Midway, for example, is an utter disaster. He seems more interested in promoting the victory's significance than in actually providing an accurate account. Morison was closely involved in many actions : this is a very poor position for a historian to occupy. Unfortunately, Morison had a sackful of prejudices and personal hatreds (he despised Halsey, for example, as a commander who didn't show him enough respect). Take this into account when reading Morison's descriptions of Halsey and others. Never depend on Morison's accounts - always consult other, more objective histories - you may start your research with Morison, but you must never end your research there. He is simply too opinionated to be fully trusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"jungle rot","review":"The negatives I find on here are the total lack of guitar solos, and the lyrics which seem like they were written just to shock and have no real content whatsoever. Now the positives, and there are many. The music on here is some of the best death metal I've ever heard, the drummer is incredible, the vocals are insane. If metallica's kill em all was thrash metal for people that dont like thrash, jungle rot's dead and buried is death metal for people that dont like death metal. That is not a bad thing, but for people that think cannibal corpse is the greatest, they may not like jungle rot. If Black Sabbath did a line of coke and had a death metal vocalist, that is more like what jungle rot is like. Buy this album. Awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"this didn't fit my car.

Hence when I read a review that the book includes this as one of the attempts to contain risk, I decided to buy it hoping to hear more about the making of the method. Unfortunately, there is only one paragraph mentioned. The rest of the book is dedicated mostly to the story about probability and a few other chapters on something else.If you regard \\"Gods\\" as the ones who throw dice and you want to know the story of people who wanted to predict the outcome of the throw and how much to bet on it, you should read the book. Otherwise, there is nothing much regarding the attempts to overcome other kinds of risks, which are no less important than probability. Hence, the naming of the book is somewhat misleading.

It's an easy read, and almost a jocular style. But its substance is hidden in sentential gems covered by irrelevant and often uninteresting history of probability history, development, and theory. The substance of this book could be reduced to a short essay; most of the book is redundant storytelling that is only of incidental interest. And those few and far-apart nuggets are all too often sophomoric and unable to sustain this reader's interest. This book is a classic example of an author who constantly looses his theme by trying to convert a brief essay into a book.

The author writes about the origins, and, most importantly, the evolution of risk. It starts with ancient times and takes us to today's financial world. I really like how he explained the evolution of risk management from primitive ways to more complex and sophisticated methods.

He traces the history of mankind's dealing with risk from the basics of probability (mostly based on renaissance gambling) through the 19th century development of statistics (means, bell curves, etc) to modern risk management (the stock market, options, and derivatives). Although all of these topics would be covered in more detail in mathematics, statistics, or finance courses, Bernstein weaves them together in a compelling way.Full of interesting stories, it starts to get more technical and difficult to read at the end.

My initial impression after reading the reviews (before ordering) was that it dealt mainly with risk associated with stock markets, but after reading through, I find that it is more of a history book - related to risk, yes - but with very little content or correlation to investing. There are snippets and references but even after half of the book is complete, there is no definite flavour on investing.For those interested in the pure historical development of probabilistic reasoning and risk, this is a well researched book, but for those whose are misled by the notion that it helps you to understand these risks in terms of the market, well, you've been misled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accomplishes what it attempts to do","review":"I picked this book up based on Mauldin recommedations, and former finance professor considered Bernstein a mentor of sorts.

So, the phrase: \\"Story of Risk\\" might sell books, but it does not accurately address this book. I did not feel engaged throughout the reading of this work, and this belies the problem with the asymmetry of title and book.However, for academics and teachers, the book does give detail which may be used to \\"spice up\\" lectures. This may prove to be its number one utility.My own barometer of whether a book is truly five stars is measured by its life on my bookshelf. I have a finite sized bookshelf, and yet the number of books being published is something for which an end of publication is difficult to see.

I particularly enjoyed the humanizing portrayal of the mathematics involved in risk assessment. The section on financial derivatives I think will help the public at large understand the importance and utility of these instruments, despite their ability to be abused.One drawback of the book was that the mathematics was not always presented clearly. This is the case with the discussion of regression to the mean, where we are left with an impression that it is easier to get heads after tails is tossed.

My father also had this problem with the exact same result. If you are extra careful while standing and sitting with the phone on your belt, you might not break the holster. If you are like me, however, the idea of a belt clip is so that I don't have to think about carrying the phone around all of the time. That is why they keep making these things so small, so we can just attach them to our body like a piece of jewelry.

Like being a good citizen, loving your country, being nice to the less fortunate than you, working hard, studying hard, etc. Yet, I found this book very interesting for that very reason, for it reminds us that art's mission was seen as very different from today as recently as a century and a half ago. Reportedly, this book was very famous in certain asian countries like Japan, and this might be because the need to inculcate moral values to the young wasn't seen as old fashioned there (at least, until very recently)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend all parents to purchase it to there 10+ kids","review":"My favourite childhood book.

For most amateur photographers the time delay aspect is of lessor importance, however a Coolpix 5000 customer should expect superior performance. The time delay is way too long between pressing the shutter button and recording the picture. Even using a lower resolution setting the delay is unacceptable for this high-end camera.All other features of the camera are up to par with expectations, which I am more than happy about. Overall the quality of the hardware and the picture itself is excellent.However it is this one aspect of speed that irks me the most.

Once when the punk refused to wash and wax the school bully's car one weekend, the bully said, \\"Look punk, if you don't have my car washed and waxed in 30 minutes, I'll grab you by the back of your shirt collar and physically make you wash my entire car with your tongue as I guide your head over the entire car.\\" Needless to say, the punk washed and waxed the bully's car my hand.

I'm not sure if this is a CF card problem - I've used the cards again with the same reader and had no problem. It is intermittent. The only thing that I did yesterday was remove the CF card from the reader without ejecting it. I then put it in the camera and formatted 2x.

This is unusable because most laptops supply only the 4-pin firewire connector. Furthermore, if you happen to lose or damage the supplied cable, you're hosed. It's a proprietary cable on the reader end of the cable. And from what I can tell, Sandisk doesn't sell the cable separately. So they've done their best to make your life difficult.I would recommend instead what I got... the Delkin PCI-Express CF Card adapter.

The title says it is plastic, but it is nothing but a cheap cardboard that is less sturdy than the cardboard box it is shipped in. The add reads like you are getting more than one for the price, which I figured was 5 becouse there are 5 shelves on the stand it is made for, but that price of $18.69 is for one only, and with the shipping charges of $14.99 that brings your total to a grand total of $33.68 for something that is worth less than the box it was shipped in. I'v been Rip-off'd in the past ordering over the internet, that is just the risk you take buying sight unseen other than a picture, but I have to say this makes the top of the list for me. I would send it back, but that would cost me another $9.60 in shipping to get $9.09 back !

Not really a one man installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This hitch is an OUTSTANDING buy!!! I have had it for almost 2 months and it has been great.

The area that the spinners are on, is not long enough, so whenever it spins, it spins off. Or due to the poor quality you are not able to put all three on, for they will not spin. If you put two on, then it will. Had to put a different piece on the tip and glue it so that the spinners won't fly away. NOT WORTH THE MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Yard Spinner","review":"This is a good idea for spinning color but the wind tears it up shortly after I put it on the fence.

They are working for a man named Fats who is introduced to us raping a man who wronged him some kind of way. that was a funny scene. they leave the game and go back to their regular jobs. fats comes back and gets revenge because the guy left his organization. the guy comes back and gets revenge on fats and the movie ends. there was a good twist in the end. i liked the twist. otherwise i'm mad i spent my money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"RAW UNDERGROUND CLASSIC","review":"THIS IS A COLLECTORS ITEM.

My original shipment arrived with only one dumbell in a box that clearly stated it contained only one. After registering a complaint, Amazon apologized and promptly sent me a replacement product. The replacement is also only one dumbell. However now they expect the original shipment returned which would only compound the problem.If you can get the two dumbbells for the advertised price, they are quite effective. The only drawback is that when you select fewer than the maximum number of weights, the remaining weights tend to get cuaght when you lift the bars from the tray. A little more care and attention resolves this difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Received a Pair","review":"I just ordered the pair of dumbbells and did indeed receive two for the advertised price.

This book contains a lot of entertaining passages, and considering it is a book about finance written by an accountant, that in itself makes the book unusual.I found the book to be well written, and very up-front about the authors biases. It was refreshing that the hidden agenda was right out in the open for everyone to inspect, just the way the author maintains that good government should operate. As Seidman states in his introduction:\\"Why write about these experiences?\\" Of course, I share the goals of most memoirists: to immortalize my contribution to society; even scores with my enemies; provide financial security for my old age, confirm the taxpayers worst suspicions about their government; and generally leave a record of my adventures for the benefit of future historians\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"Contrary to that suggested, if not indicated, this SNAA03 is not a titanium case or band watch.

It holds its charge so that I can leave it off the charger for three days or so, and I still get solid power. The dual brush allows for getting at all areas in the mouth and covers a wide area when held sideways. The toothbrush is fairly lightweight, easy to use and hold. I'm not sure it always slows down accurately on its timer to encourage the brusher to move to another tooth area, but to me that doesn't matter. I brush thoroughly, and this toothbrush makes thorough brushing much easier than a manual toothbrush.The price is more than inexpensive for the quality - it's downright super-affordable. I'll see how long the brush head lasts, but for now, this is worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tongue Mangler !","review":"I've used the small round Oral B brushes for many years with no problems. The Dual Action / Dual Clean is another matter. It started out working alright, although like many others I found the brush head to be a bit too large. One day while brushing, the brush severely pinched my tongue causing it to bleed. Upon close inspection, the lower oblong brush seemed loose with a substantial gap between it and the brush housing. I suspect that over time friction wears away at the internal parts leading to looseness.I was not happy about the experience and sent the defective brush to Procter & Gamble for evaluation. I was quite surprised when they replied that no manufacturing defect was present, despite being informed of the loose lower brush. They could provide no explanation as to how the injury occurred and would not provide any contact information for me to escalate the issue. If this is P&G;'s attitude towards product safety, I will avoid purchasing any of their products in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral B Dual Clean Brush","review":"At first I was hesitant to try this brush, but I thought because my teeth are a bit larger It may be worth a try.

So then I tried the create program disk mode and again it said that the operation was a sucess. Tried to boot up, nothing but errors. After about 3 hours of wasting my time and money I had to re-install windows Xp from scratch. The drive utility that came with the Maxtor Hard Drive was more useful than this over priced [item].

I finally gave up and bought Norton Ghost. It performed the cloning in 11 minutes! And, the new disk worked perfectly.

It is, rather, an attempt to supply a Thomistic pedigree for the 'New Natural Law Theory' developed by Finnis in his earlier books and articles. This is the upshot of recent reviews in THE THOMIST (April 2001 issue) and The American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly (Winter 2001 issue).

However, the current versions for sale of \\"Mistress\\" and \\"Stranger\\" are a nighmare to view and take totally away from the actors and plot line."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't have it all ...","review":"I wrote a review before, but it seems to be lost.Now that I have the S3 for some time more, it makes anyway sense to update it. The S3 is neat because of its size. What is not nice is that the camera is unusable in low light. The flash works at most 8 feet and tends to badly overexpose on a normal setting. Resetting the camera sensitivity for the flash is not acceptable. As the flash, as the battery suffers from the small size. Not very usable. Where the S3 was practically unusable, the Sony DSC-S85 made perfect pictures with and without flash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst camera ever?","review":"This is a terrible camera currently on my second one as first the camera would not stay on.With the new one the battery life is measured in minutes.

Complete coverage of the whole country. I especially liked the History chapter and the Further Reading Appendix. I always like to read up on the history of where I'm going and this book is an outstanding resource. The Where to Stay sections were large and useful.My only complaints are that this book could use color maps instead and more detailed transport sections. I would have liked it to list the estimated travel prices and travel times in a table. Actually, I wish most travel guides would have a table summarizing everything from hotels, restaurants and transport but most travel guides don't do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"well researched but very dry","review":"I read this book in order toi write a book report about it for my AP history class. the book guves a very deatiled account of the brief life of the Free Soil party. I would say this book is long on evidence and short on conclusions. The author does a poor job of outlining main points or making them easy to grasp, so the main ideas tend to get lost in a sea of names and dates. Nonetheless, this book was painstakingly researched, and i liked thew way the author quoted liberally from newspaper articles and editorials of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless, Worthless, Worthless!!!","review":"They might as well have called this book \\"Benji saves the universe\\". It is foul in the extreme. I am wading through Calculus II right now, and this book is so unreadable...so thoroughly un-understandable...and did I mention the wrong answers in teh back? Jeez, you would think that by the EIGHTH edition, these losers would have finally worked out the editorial quirks from the first edition. In fact however, it has gotten worse. If you read the solutions manual reviews, a guy there says that there are correct answers in the fourth edition that are now wrong in the eighth edition. So in other words...this book is getting WORSE with time. Howard, Anton, and Biven should become cheese makers or widget fashioners or something...but not textbook authors. Save yourself the headaches, and try and take this course somewhere where they are not using this foul excuse for a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless book","review":"I purchased this book for Calc III (Didn't have time to get it from Amazon otherwise I would have purchased just the Calc III book). While trying to do the homework, I return to the text for help. The examples are far and few between and even when you do get one, its very basic. I absolutely do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Textbook and Solution Manual Suck","review":"I think the text is hard to understand and the solution manual's answers are not worked out and are identical to the answers in the back of the textbook. Don't buy the solution manual! Not worth it!I read the text from page to page because I have a bad professor who can't teach and can't speak English. He knows his stuff, but he can't teach so if you happen to be in my shoes with bad teacher and bad book,I say 'screw' the class and take it another time! The text is difficult to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult book to understand and made me dislike Calculus.","review":"The primary problem with this book is it does not explain the concept using more then a cryptic 1/2 page of text. It then proceeds to bombard you with examples that make virtually no sense because you will most likely not fully understand the concept. This method is repeated over and over again.I also had the impression that the example problems were overly complex and instead of demonstrating the concept being taught, they added unnecessary complexity for complexity sake.I am a fan of the building block method of learning where you keep a subject simple until it is mastered and then you build upon it. This book does not follow that process.Lastly, if you are purchasing this book I would recommend you try to find other sources from your local library to reinforce your learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Math Book","review":"This is a typical math book in that it uses a LOT of words that only math teachers and majors use on a regular basis, but it's still quite readable. The way Howard Anton puts some of the Calculus formulae are totally undreadable if you don't have a strong math-brain, because he uses far too many variables and symbols without sufficient explaination. Other than that, my only other complaint is that, like most math books, the answers in the back of this book are so condensed that you need an entire new book to learn the methods of condensing answers in order to even read them."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAY-Z big pimpin!","review":"JAY-z's comes out with another tight single.

It is vaporware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but not especially useful","review":"I agree that Svejda tends to hyperbolize. Things are usually black or white with him, with negative comments clearly his forte. He relishes the chance to use vitriol and overly-cute anecdotes. Reading the negative comments is like watching a child throw a tantrum so in a way the book gives a certain perverse pleasure. Other reviewers are more timely, more accurate, and less likely to let personal opinions of the artists affect their reviews. If you want a more comprehensive guide, the Penguin Guide will do the trick. It is plain-written and reviews many recordings of a given work whereas Svejda usually lists just one or two recordings, i.e., his favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated, biased","review":"The author's view is outdated as well as the book itself. He overestimates Reiner too much, and the fact that he grew up in Chicago listening to Reiner's concerts makes the bias more evident. Overall, he is too biased towards American orchestras and old recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too biased, but somewhat entertaining","review":"I think Svejda is a great salesman, but beyond that there is little, if nothing, that shows me that he knows much about music beyond his own narrow personal favorites which are questionable at best.Give him credit for being a great con man though"},{"rating":"2","title":"A extradinary good film","review":"When I selected this film to watch, it was on the preamble attached to the film, my surprise was how good it was, warm, realistic and wonderfully made.

To be honest, the forms were very basic and did not take advantage of color printers or fancy fonts. I used the forms I needed as a model to create a better versions in microsoft excel. If you are looking for basic forms to provide your clients and vendors, this book contains all that you need. If you need something alittle fancier, and are good with your computer, model your own from what is provided. I would still rate this book as a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful CD","review":"This book is full of forms that are very helpful for people either starting a business or looking to get their business more organized. If you run a small interior design business, these forms would help you to look more professional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Creative","review":"What an incredible disappointment!! I have to agree with the point of view of one other reader...this book has absolutely nothing new to tell anyone about organizing... the writers try to pretend there is a different spin to their method, but it just ain't true! I read the book hoping that someone would give me some refreshing ideas that would enable me to throw away my daytimer forever. Imagine my suprise when we get down to the nitty-gritty and up pops the picture of a daytimer-type organizer page, as well as other materials taught at Franklin Covey seminars!! Hey, if that had worked I would not have picked up this book! Bottom line I got from the book: creative people have to learn to stop and focus some of the time. Consider yourself right-brained in a left-brained world and do the best you can. There is nothing new under the sun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative People Organizing","review":"As a professional organizer I find this book very useful and insightful. The authors present the information in a very easy and fun to read manor without a lot of useless extras. They also write in a positive tone to accept ones organizing challenges and accept them but they also give great examples on how to overcome them and become right-brain organized people. I would recommend this book to any one having or know someone with organizing challenges in their own homes and businesses. I would also recommend this book for professional organizers to read wanting to help their more creative clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cutesy for my taste","review":"I found this book too cutesy for my taste, with its focus on \\"Arbies\\" (Right-Brainers) and \\"Elbies\\" (Left-Brainers). The authors reiterate many of Stephen Covey's concepts from \\"The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.\\" Overall, however, there is too much emphasis on psychoanalyzing, labeling, justifying, and excuse-making, rather than practical suggestions and approaches, although you will find a few common-sense ideas sprinkled in between the extensive simplistic discussions of \\"Arbies\\" versus \\"Elbies.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy the tape alone","review":"I own the paperback edition of this title and found parts of it helpful enough to want the audiotape to renew my motivation and reinforce the ideas. I am very disappointed in how short the tape is. So much has been cut from the book that I think it'd be almost worthless to get the tape on its own. The tape is missing most of the text that got me excited about the book, so it's not much good for getting me fired up to get organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creative Person's Guide Not So Creative","review":"I guess I had my hopes up too high for this book because of the previous reviews I read on Amazon's web site. I had hoped this book would reveal something about organization that could give me a fresh take on it and make it a fun, creative process...some new perspective that might make cleaning interesting and even enjoyable. Not so. The introductory psychological information was overly simplistic and overgeneralized. The \\"organizational plans\\" were typical and nothing new. I've read many other books with \\"organizing\\" themes, and this one told me nothing I didn't already know. If you want a simplistic, stereotypical view of \\"right-brainers\\" and organizing, get this book. If you want to read a better book about organizing that doesn't contain shallow psycho-pop, buy a Don Aslett or Clean Team book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bible For The Entrepreneural Manager","review":"I'm an executive in a highly competitive and aggressive sales organization with a colorful mix of \\"creative\\" and \\"analytical\\" minds. Beyond the valuable \\"personal organizational system\\" offered, this book is a powerful awareness tool for those expected to develop people's potential into bottom-line benefits; offering leaders a better understanding of how the two types of minds experience and interact with their world, and then how to synchronize them into a highly efficient go-to-market machine. It's very easy to make this book about you but, its true value is in making it work for those that work for and with you - then, everyone wins... especially, your customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking yet Engrossing","review":"As a Timothy Dalton fan, I had to watch \\"The King's Whore\\" just to see a new side of my favourite actor, and I was completely drawn into it. There is a lot of fighting and it is rather risque at times, but the plot is memorable. I loved the costumes and the scenery of Europe--this is a period piece about a king who falls desperately in love with a young married woman. She feels trapped because every single person she knows and trusts blames her for not agreeing to serve her king--by becoming his mistress. It takes her own husband disbelieving that she has not yet gone to the king for her to succumb to the pressure, yet she never enjoys his presence at all. A war erupts with France and she becomes ill, and because of the king's love for her, he cannot concentrate on fighting a war and instead heals her himself. I won't give away the ending, but it's a superb film with excellent acting. I definitely recommend it, but caution everyone that it deserves it's 'R' rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been a Timothy Dalton fan ever since I saw Jane Eyre, but this movie is difficult to take even for the most devoted. Please do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is easily damaged in shipping","review":"The rubber dragonflies are easily broken.

However, when the item came it wasn't what I was expecting. The copper bath did not look like a bright/shiny copper, it was a strange non-copper color and the feel was not smooth but gritty. Is this good for birds? I also can't tell if it is real copper, copper plated, or just copper colored?I also received mine with plastic dragon flies which look really lame, but the picture did not have these either.Is there a difference between product number OP-25130 and OP-25130-1?

Should be \\"Bowhunting in small lots in overpopulated areas\\". Was hoping for more insight to whitetail behaviour under heavy hunting pressure. Not a lot of hunting wisdom.

Hard to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good info for the hardcore","review":"This book was very detailed and I am sure I will be using some information from it, but this guy is pretty hardcore. The sub-title gives a little bit more of an accurate view of this book: big bucks. If your number one concern is how to get on big bucks in pressurd areas, then this will be your book. I am more of a meat hunter and while this book is helpful in that regard, this guy is about the big bucks and a lot of his strategies are geared in that direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"As the title indicates, I found this disappointing. I knew there wasn't going to be much in this book when the entire first chapter used charts and graphs to demonstrate that pressured bucks are harder to find!!!Also, he spent a good number of pages telling us how to approach landowners for permission to hunt! That is NOT what you buy a book like this for.He also presents a regimen for success that is so drastic I don't think many will follow thru. For example -- he prepares 80 different trees for stands.The book wasn't a total loss, as he does give a prioritized list of the 4 things to look for in the woods that are best places to find deer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Classic","review":"I've read many bowhunting books over the years. I thought that I'd heard it all. This book proves that I didn't. I was very surprised by the great info this book provides.Rest assured that this is not for the weekend bowhunter, this is hard-core bowhunting.This book will hold a spot on my bookself reserved only for the \\"classics\\".Very worthwhile. Right up there with Wensel's \\"Hunting Rutting Whitetails\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"This is a very good book that provides good advice not only for bowhunters, but also gun hunters in pressured areas. This is one of the few useful books/magazine articles I have read, due to its focus on pressured deer. Where I hunt in Mississippi, even private land deer are highly pressured. Only VERY rich people can afford to hunt them on tracts large enough to beat back the pressure. This book provides information that both backed up what I already knew and gave me some new tactics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"John Eberhart manages to take nice bucks year after year from one of the heaviest hunted and poorest manage states without having to pay anyone to hunt their land. this book is worth every minute of your time ,but if you only want to read one of John's books then make it \\"Precision Bowhunting\\" much the same info just laid out a bit nicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Just as the name implies if you are bowhunting whitetails in pressured areas this book is one of the best. Theres something here for everyone but if you are a begining bowhunter this book is a must own.

I had never read a Gregg Loomis book and was really looking forward to discovering another author of thrillers to enjoy. Terribly disappointing book. I was assuming this was his first book, so I started with this one. The pace of the book is plodding and the editor should be shot for missing so many spelling and grammar mistakes. The main character, Lang Reilly, is boring with a capital B. The most interesting character is, oh wait, there isn't one! Here's a spoiler, if you can call it that, his dog died and \\"came back to life\\" in 1/2 a page, pleeezzzz! Don't waste your money or your time. The only reason I gave it one star was for the idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than most Da Vinci clones","review":"All the books that I have read so far that have attempted to capitalize on the Da Vinci bandwagon have been not-so-great clones with variations thrown in, but The Pegasus Secret stands out as being different despite the similar sounding names of the heroes or the fact that a painting is at the center of the plot. In fact, I must say honestly that I found the premise of this book to be much more believable than the Da Vinci Code. What I like about this book (in fact I saw a similar style in another book,The Rozabal Line) was the punctuation of fictional narrative with historical narrative. It makes one feel less \\"guilty\\" about reading fiction because one also ends up \\"learning\\" something along the way. That being said, I think that the book drags initially but picks up momentum for those who do not get put off by the initial lack of speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I could only get through the first two chapters before I snorted with laughter.

She lets him reveal all of his desires and whilst in the process of trying to cure him she gets obsessed with him, which later on turn out to be Dan's downfall when he tries to back out on her.

Mr. Salamunovich is a genius. I've had the privilage of working with him and it was fantastic. He has so much LIFE that he brings into the room. And through his choir, so many emotions are conveyed.

He is a GREAT man, who i thank from the bottom of my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - I was disappointed","review":"I fell in love with Lauridsen's O Magnum Mysterium, and wanted to hear more. OMM is an absolutely brilliant piece that stuns everyone I play it to. I thought I'd found an amazing new composer, and looked forward to discovering his work. I was VERY disappointed to find that all the other tracks sound just the same as O Magnum Mysterium, and to find that - on this showing - Lauridsen is a one-string fiddle. The exception is Mid-Winter Songs, which started out very differently (though on first hearing I was not very impressed). But what do you know? Very soon it starts to sound just the same as all the others. Also the version of O Magnum Mysterium on this CD is not as good IMHO as the one by the Canterbury Cathedral Choir (but maybe that's just Brit bias!). So I'm very sad to say - only buy this CD if you want 76 minutes of O Magnum Mysterium in 17 versions. Sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars Are Not Enough!","review":"In this contemporary \\"Lux Aeterna\\", Lauridsen and the Los Angeles Master Chorale have created a work I have found both as haunting as Brahm's German requiem and as joyous as Gounod's Saint Cecilia Mass. The other works on this recording are only slightly less beautiful. I have taken to playing the title work whenever I want a peaceful break, or the entire recording when I simply want to spoil myself. I cannot recommend this recording more highly to those who have not already had the pleasure, but be warned, it may be hard to resist the temptation to play it every day --- then again, why not??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauridsen Is Johannes Brahms Incarnate","review":"The Lux Eterna CD transports you into another world.

It's reassuring to know that sacred choral music is alive and well in America. The only reason I didn't give this recording 5 stars is that I would have preferred a CD of ONLY sacred texts.

From Ogden Nash to William Wordsworth, from silly to stoic, every imaginable cat poem is in the book. I love cats and I love the poems, so I'd have to give the TEXT a five star rating.The illustrations in the book are beautiful line drawings by Peter Parnall. The book is divided into chapters and each chapter opens with one of Parnall's illustrations. In my opinion, there are too few Parnall drawings. The prominent Parnall illustration on the dust jacket seems to promise more illustrations than there are in the book. The lack of illustrations drops my rating below a five.The book is currently out of print, but tracking down a copy of this cute kitty book should be much easier than stalking sparrows on the front lawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought this program but it never successfully installed.

There are lots of vocal pieces to learn about jazz phrasing, and some very dynamic instrumental work, as well as a host of jazz standards that you may be surprised to hear again. I bought this together withPure Jazz Encore, immediately doubling the usefulness, depth, and variety of the selections.

When the power fails, I immediately shut down the PC and can use the LED lamp for about 12 hours to supply light if needed.

But, when they choose to perform a cover of a song, it can once in awhile back on the singer. For somebody like Mariah Carey, her songlist is quite remarkable, but she could use some improvement on some covers here & there. This is one of them. Her remake of the Phil Collins classic Against All Odds, sounds a little bit wimpy, and not really heartfelt. Even though it was good when Phil recorded it, it just doesn't seem to be a very well thought fit from Mariah.

It was incredible. I attended primarily to see/hear Larue and they did not disappoint. Their voices and music was so natural and effortless; I thought I was listening to their CDs. Now, as far as Transparent is concerned, I think it would be really difficult for any fan of contemporary Christian music to not like this CD. This CD touches on a number of different subjects and emotions -- bringing you up with praise songs like Near to Me and to tender, thoughtfull songs like Fallen For You and Brianna's Song. They've taken their first CD up a notch. You will like this!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first, believe it or not!","review":"I was very impressed when I picked up Transparent on January 23rd, the release date. Every song on it is excellent, and even more mature and beautiful than the ones on the last record, although their debut was impressive as well. If LaRue had just a little too much pop taste on their debut for you, I highly recommend that you pick up this album! As the reviewer before me said, there is a good mix of fast and slow songs. If you're not usually a lover of slow songs, be prepared to be blown away. \\"Fallen for You\\" and \\"Brianna's Song\\" are absolutely beautiful; you won't be able to resist them! Also check out \\"Theory of Flight\\", \\"Near to Me\\", and \\"I Can't Sing\\".

I've always liked what Phil & Nat have to sing about, and this album is certianly no exception. Nat's voice is soooooooooo beautiful, and that espeically can be noticed on \\"Brianna's Song\\" which is a beautiful song penned for thier sister. They have always written about teen issues that are relevant to us today, and that's one of the things I like about them. That and the fact that they lov God so much and are a great singers!

As with their first effort, there's plenty of great vocals and energetic music to please the ear. One big difference is that they have obviously matured as musicians and singers. There's a good mix of slower and faster songs, my favourites would have to be \\"Theory of Flight\\", \\"Wake Up\\", \\"I Can't Sing\\", \\"One White Tulip\\", and \\"Fly\\". Also be sure to check out the hidden track. There's nothing to dissapoint you, the whole album is filled with good music. Four stars, but more like 8.5 out of 10. You won't regret buying this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Gazillion Bubbles instead","review":"My son got this bubble blower for his birthday. The only thing we (his parents) could get it to do is create a bubble that sat on the top of the hand held piece. It would not work well at all. Now it doesn't even do that. We have had a gazillion bubble machine in the past, and they work great, just don't let your kids put sand in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I would have like to give it 4 1/2 stars. I thought it started a little slow but soon after that I couldn't put it down. It really was a great book. I had no idea who it was until near the end. It was the perfect \\"who done it\\". I think I will read it again now that I know who it was to see what little clues I may have missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite book.","review":"As a novelist, I strive for the talent Tami Hoag displays in this book. She tells the story so skillfully that you cannot put the book down from beginning to end. The characters are complex and multi-dimentional, and I loved both of them for their strengths and their weaknesses. The ending is carried through to fulfillment, and I just love this book. It is my favorite. Tami Hoag is my favorite author. She is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of suspense; a complete pleasure to read","review":"There's no dull moment for Nick and Annie in this one. I gave this one a 5 on my list, unfortunately that was before I started leaving my reviews on Amazon. I'm taking the time to share all my 5 star reads in hope you'll read them and enjoy them as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I am new to Tami Hoag. She was recommended to me by some fellow kindler's. This book caught my attention but found through other reviews that I should read Cry Wolf first. I'm glad I did and while I did enjoy Cry Wolf I thought this book was better. I liked the characters more. I do love stories in the Bayou setting. I enjoyed the Cajun dialog. I will be recommending this one to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful","review":"Tami Hoag creates a suspenseful novel that you just can't put down. It it attention grabing and continuously makes you wondering exactly who did it.. This is the first novel that I have read by her. But now I have a great interest in reading other novels by Hoag."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Choice If You Feel Like Reading A Murder Mystery","review":"This was my first Tami Hoag novel, and I highly enjoyed it. The characters were extremely well developed. Tami definitely has a penchant for writing great dialog. This novel will definitely keep you guessing until the end and makes you think twice about cases where everyone swears so-and-so is the killer (eg, I hate to say it, the OJ Simpson case)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice, Suspenseful Read","review":"Taking a few threads from previous novels, Tami Hoag's A THIN DARK LINE centers around the murder of a young real estate agent in a small Louisiana town. Spearheading the investigation is hot-headed(and not particularly level-headed)detective Nick Fourcade, who early on in the book manages to get himself thrown from the investigation and ultimately suspended after beating the prime suspect to within an inch of his life. He then relies on the help of Annie Broussard, a police deputy not particularlyliked by in the precinct(mostly it seems because she's a woman). While Hoag drops a few more suspects in throughout the book, you'd be hardpressed to guess who the murderer ends up being--I was definately surprised. For the most part, Hoag has a good grasp of narrative, though she probably could have cut the page count on this significantly had she been more concise more often. Overall, Hoag will keep you in suspense enough throughout to keep you sticking around 'til the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lock Your Doors & Windows","review":"This novel will keep you turning the pages as well as peeking out your window at every sound ( God forbid the dog barks!)I couldn't put it down, highly recommend & challenge you to pick who the real killer is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense Reading","review":"This book was hard to put down. Ms. Hoaq really knows how to keep a person's interest. I really got upset with Deputy Annie Broussard's character at times, but Ms. Hoaq generally pulled me back to liking her. I was really surprised who was the actual killer. Looking forward to reading more of Ms. Hoaq's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thin Dark Line","review":"A Thin Dark Line was the 3rd Tami Hoag book I've read so far, and also the best! It mixes the unique culture of Louisiana, which I love, and the ingrediants of a great mystery. I couldn't put it down! In many other \\"mysterys\\" I've read, you can figure out exactly who the killer is within about 5 or 10 pages. If you can do that, then the book isn't really a mystery. But in this book, I didn't know who the real antagonist was until the very end. A must read for all mystery fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCITING","review":"This book has many surprises and twists that will keep your nose embedded in it! I loved it! Very exciting and well-written. She has an interesting and accurate way of depicting cajun society."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book!","review":"I thought this book was outstanding! Once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. The Louisana bayou was a great setting for this book full of mystery and shady characters. The sexual tension and envolvement between Annie and Fourcade was an added bonus for me, since I usually don't like romance in a good thriller. The suspects in this book were all capable of the crimes, but the actual person who was guilty completely surprised me! This was refreshing because I ususlly guess it halfway through a book. This book would make a great movie because it has it all! I can't wait to read her other books. Keep up the good work, Tami!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow-paced for a mystery/thriller reader.","review":"This was my first Tami Hoag novel. I was interested in it because of the fact that I am from the \\"bayou country\\". However, I was quite dissapointed. I love a good, fast-paced mystery/thriller and this was not the case. It took me a good 3 months, and several other books in between, to finish this one. The best part of the book was the beginning and the very end...everything else was boring. I will give another novel by Ms. Hoag a try before I take her off my best author's list.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw out half the book and maybe it would be good","review":"Well, I finished reading the book---but OMG, it was slow. Ms. Hoag repeats herself silly. I wanted to scream, \\"I got your point!\\", over and over again. This book reminds me of a teenager who is asked to wrtie a paper and make it 1000 words long, so he fills in most of this paper with useless words trying to make it long enough. Even the suspenseful parts (if you could call them that) got old. I was yawning more than anything. I have read other Hoag books which I enjoyed, but this one was by far the worst one I have read. I think I will stop reading her books as I am really tired of re-reading and re-reading and re-reading the same thing over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thin dark line","review":"This is the second book by tami hoag that i have read the first kill the messenger. a thin dark line was enjoyable albeit long and it took me a while which is unusual for me to get into the story i must admit the killer was a total suprise and was worth the long road to getting there. I was disappointed with nick and annie's relationship which i thought could have had a little more depth at the end and what was the relationship with nick and mr marcotte it was never explained but all in all it was an good book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to her new book, but now that I am reading it, I'm having trouble keeping with it. My mind keeps wandering. Just now believeable to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book by a great author","review":"Now Tami really proves to be the master of suspense.I started reading her books arter Dark Paradise & this one proves to even better than the rest.Its much more thrilling & it keeps the readers guessing till the climax of the story.I'd surely recommends this to all who love mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY good read.","review":"First book by Tami Hoag I've ever read, and it was great! You think you knew what was going to happen, then there's another twist! I loved the romatic story involved also."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read","review":"This is the first Tami Hoag book I've read and I will definetely read more. Very fast paced with an unexpected ending. The only downfall would be that I have a few unanswered questions. For example who called Nick that night at the bar? Overall it was a great read, longwinded but worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great","review":"This is my first Tami Hoag book and I was pleasantly surprised. It has suspense, but without all the gore. As soon as I thought I figured out the murder mystery, the next chapter changed my mind. Because of this, it kept me glued to the pages to see what would happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"The storyline was gripping,and the Cajun setting and the characters all wonderfully crafted. The sassy banter and romance between the two main characters was just great, and added extra sparks. In fact, the dialogue of all the characters was spot on, and brought each one to life in the most vivid way. The only thing I found disappointing was the the serial rapist part, and his identity which came out of nowhere. It was a moment that seemed weak, and showed maybe Annie was not such a great detective after all. Andalso that the Mardi Gras masks were being used by both the killer and the rapist? To me that was never really explained...copy cat I guess. Anyhow, overall a good read and it was my first Tami Hoag novel, but definately not my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful and slow","review":"I've tried to read this book off and on for weeks now and it is agonizingly slow. The characters are not believable or compelling and the story simply does not move. Character development is non-existent and there are too many characters and subplots that dilute the novel. The unlikely (but predictable) romance between the two lead characters is a stretch at best. When it is described it is something out of a harlequin novel only not as complex (yes, that was sarcasm). I've stopped reading it as I'd rather watch my fingernails grow. Just can't stand to waste time to get through the last 1/4 of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I have come to expect from Tami Hoag","review":"Tami Hoag is one of my favorite writers and I almost always buy her books. The depth of disappointment in A Thin Dark Line is virtually impossible to express. Contrived plot, unbelievable characters, and unrealistic dialogue are just a few of the things that make this effort of Tami's so unworthwhile. I normally read one of Tami's books in a single sitting - at most, two. I have been plowing away at this one for three or four weeks now. Just stubborn I guess - hate to give up. If this is the first book of Tami's you've read, please give her another chance. Her other books are really good - not like this one - at least all the ones I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I liked Tammi Hoag's previous novels. This one, however, I didn't even finish, which is very rare for me. I got bogged down in the Cajun theme and slowly lost interest. I'll try again, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like","review":"This was my first book by Tami Hoag and maybe my last. The first few pages were good, but it quickly got too descriptive and boring. I skipped many pages. I guessed who dunnit before it was revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"If you are thinking about buying this book... stop. I loved Dark Paradise by Tami Hoag and eagerly bought A Thin Dark Line. It is gathering dust on my nightstand. I don't even like any of the main characters. I may try again but only because I hate to waste money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was guessing until the end!","review":"After a friend recommended Tami Hoag's books I picked up this one as my first title. I read nearly the entire book in one day! I was sure I knew how the book was going to end but I was intrigued when the final events unfolded with unexpected excitement at every turn of the page! An excellent book for all mystery lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, fast read with good mix of plots and characters.","review":"I've read very little of her work, but after this book, I'm going back through her archives! I enjoyed the plot development, and the strong female characters. Nicely done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing twist at the end","review":"What a great book. I've read and reread it.I hope the two main characters surface in another book, because they were great.The story has everything, in just the right measure. Sometimes very scary, I was kept on the edge of my seat.Fantastic work Tami Hoag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamy, Sexy Suspense","review":"In \\"The Thin Dark Line\\", Tami Hoag gives us Deputy Annie Boussard. After finding a mutilated body of a woman in Louiana's French Triangle, Annie is faced with tracking a killer and risking her own life.I liked the way Ms. Hoag wove this story of romance and mystery. And I have to admit, I blushingly had a crush on Detective Nick Fourcade. A man like that just has to be trusted....or does he?The *Cajun French Glossary\\" in the back of the book was a linguial plus.A riveting romp of a book \\"mes amies\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Suspense","review":"This book will keep you guessing who the killer might be and in the end, the surprise is worth it.

The music is fresh and original; the lyrics are awesome--always giving glory to the Lord. The author tells of his struggles and triumphs in the Christian life using a storybook fashion. I was amazed after reading the credits that Kevin Ayers played most instruments, wrote all original lyrics, and recorded and mixed this album in his own studio. What a talented individual! A most enjoyable listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Low Definition","review":"The movie is not bad but the DVD transfer sucks. I would give the movie four stars, zero for DVD quality. The main feature, six trailers, and two language tracks are all on a single-layer disk (4.7GB) with a lot of room to spare, so the bit rate must be extremely low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"This ring was bulky and didn't fit correctly.

To enjoy some of Elton's 80s work, you have to either enjoy that type of production that was employed in the music at the time, or simply get past it. Behind the production of this album, there are some classic Elton tunes. Cry to Heaven, Nikita, Wrap Her Up, Satellite, Candy by the Pound, and Shoot Down the Moon are great songs. A lot of folks may disagree with me on the last two, but I think they are fun and funky. If you like 80s music, you'll probably appreciate this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"For die hards only","review":"Generally forgettable album from 1985 that seemed to stunt the resurgence seen on albums like \\"Jump Up\\" and \\"Too Low For Zero.\\" There were a couple of hits from this one and both of them, \\"Wrap Her Up\\" and \\"Nikita\\" keep this one from being a complete lost, but you'd be better off looking for these songs on various \\"greatest hits\\" compilations."},{"rating":"1","title":"one word... cheap. cheap. cheap.","review":"I don't have much to say about this product as it broke the first time my son took a swing at the ball perched upon it... he's only four years old.

I do not recommend this book to anyone who wants to know facts about their pregnancy rather than someone's misguided opinions. He also has a very biased opinion regarding natural birth vs medicated. Dr's should give you the facts and let you decide which is best for YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate","review":"This is the kind of book for only a small segment of the population. Unfortunately this physician only sees birth as an emergency. In the process, he legitimizes all medicalization of birth. Indeed, he has a captive audience, since femininity is challenged and he is the savior each time.The irony is that the outcomes of all his interventions for the normal, healthy mother and baby pair are not looked at since it is all over for him after the delivery. Too bad he is not able to visit postpartum and see why the anxiety occurs predictably due to the birth experience for the mother and baby.I would not recommend this book to the general population---only high risk mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the perfect pregnancy book.","review":"It seems like 5 stars are not nearly enough for this! I have looked for many sources on pregnancy and this one sums it into one fun to read, informative, reasurring, and honest book. Who would have thought a book about pregnancy would be such a page-turner? The author captures your heart as well as your mind making it difficult to close the book and put it down. In fact, I'm buying it for all of my pregnant friends (and my \\"trying to get pregnant\\" friends). It is such a pleasure to read. My husband has even read a few of the chapters. The format is very convenient and the \\"frequently asked question\\" section is a great quick reference. This is the one and only book you will need. I highly recommend this book to any pregnant woman or anyone currently trying to get pregnant. A great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play-On","review":"I needed something for my wife and I to enjoy this summer.

Space Station Seventh Grade is a good book and is very true to life in middle school. Jason and Marceline consists of guys talking about who's \\"doing it\\" and the size of girls' breasts and how they'd like to get their hands on them. This may be the type of conversation that goes on in middle school, but I think it is demeaning to the girls. The book summary on Amazon.com says that Jason is surprised to find that Marceline rejects him, but that's not quite the whole story. Jason pressures Marceline to let him give her a hickey, and he gets angry and stomps off when she won't let him. They finally get back together, and she makes him promise he won't give her a hickey. I'm concerned that the message it sends is that girls who don't give in to their boyfriends will lose them, and that's not a message I want to endorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jason and Marceline not for everyone, but wait a minute...","review":"I teach middle-school Language Arts, and, while I wouldn't necessarily read this book WITH my class, I would recommend it to students to read for outside reading. Spinelli is a master with the written word; I read the majority of his books as a teenager and will reread them on occasion even now. I must disagree with the teacher who felt Spinelli's portrayal of girls in Jason and Marceline was poor. In the end, Jason learns that Jason must be Jason and Marceline must be Marceline. He learns to accept her as she is--eccentricities and all. Jason is flawed, and he is definitely not politically correct. (Name a middle schooler who is!) Regardless, Spinelli can somehow recapture the ambivalence of adolescence while possessing the wisdom of an adult...the mark of a truly gifted writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Book for Kids","review":"This book is a very dull book because kids in ninth grade don't act like this. It was very boring to read because all it was about was having a boyfriend or girlfriend. I don't reccomend this to anyone because I think it is poor literture."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a teenage guy, I feel a little insulted......","review":"I really didn't like this book. Why? The guys in this book were all really dumb, which I think was kind of sexist. And the way the guys keep disrespecting girls is insulting to girls. I don't treat women that way and I hope other guys don't. All-in-All, this book was just shallow and dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, realistic book.","review":"Jason and Marceline was a very realistic book. JS managed to get inside a 14 year old's brain and write his thoughts. Being 13 I know what the book is about and some of the problems in the book are the ones I face. I would not recomend this book to kids under 13 as it uses a lot of swearing and sexual references. It kept me turning pages though until there were no more to turn. A great book for ages 13-16."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good at all.","review":"I'm normally a fan of Jerry Spinelli and his books but this one was, well, bad. The characters, for the most part, were pretty stupid and not very interesting. The plot was also pretty stupid and kind of dull. Also, many of the parts were disgusting. Especially the part in which the guys are talking about wanting to stick their faces in a girl's chest! (Eeeeewwwww!!!) I hope boys really don't talk like that in real life! Talk about sick!!! I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who wants a good read. Jerry Spinelli can do much, much better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthless waist of time.","review":"This book was perfectly awful. If it was possible I would have givin it zero stars. I am in the eighth grade and none of the people in my school act like this. People might be thinking this but don't actually say it out loud. This book was also degrading towards both boys and girls. The one charactor in this book who I actually liked was Marcaline. I don't recomend this book for people of of any age and anyone under 15 should absolutly not read it! Save yourself the time and put this book where it belongs. In the trash can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise","review":"We got this album because the vocalist is a good friend of ours. We had faith in his voice but honestly didn't expect to like so many of the songs! I had to get a second CD because during my visit home my brother borrowed it and wouldn't give it back. VERY fun CD to listen to, especially in the car. When is the next one coming out???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cruise tunes","review":"This is one of those albums which, after the first time through, you may be left scratching your head, wondering how to classify their style. However, after another run through or two, you no longer feel the need to hang a label on them, and you're solidly hooked. Upbeat tracks like 'Sometimes' and 'I'd Believe It's True' are great mood elevators. 'Find Myself A Way' is a quasi-country romp that would have fit well in the movie \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou\\", although it's thoroughly contemporary in sound. 'High Kind of Low' also ranks as a top track. At least 10 of the 13 tracks get frequent replay in my player. Can't believe I'm not hearing these folks on the radio here yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"You like 80's new wave? You like the B-Heads? You like the Talking-52's?

The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is that there are almost no finger guides or notations in the majority of the music I have attempted to play. I have spent a lot more time than anticipated writing my own. The songs sound lovely though, and I couldn't be happier with the selection of music.I do enjoy the spiral binding as it makes opening up the book so much easier. I wish all sheet music books were bound like this. The separate lyrics book was a really nice touch too. I would also note that though there may be some easier songs most of them appear to be of an intermediate level of difficulty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the season!","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend a few years ago and wanted one of my own. It's great for the holiday season with classics and more 'popular' tunes all in one volume. Some of the arrangements I'm not too fond of - i.e. 4/4 time for O Holy Night - but overall, it makes a great standard to have around for Christmas. We enjoyed a sing-along caroling night at our house and it was so nice to have the little booklet with just the words. We'd run a few photocopies of the songs people wanted to sing and that way everyone knew the lyrics as I played along. The little grace notes of extra notes (to make the sound bigger) can sometimes be distracting when trying to just quickly sight-read the songs, but after two plays through a song I felt fine with most of the arrangements. I've been playing piano for over 20 years (less since I've left college) and most of the songs I could sight-read. Really fun to have this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased for a Christmas Gift","review":"If you want a 'guaranteed' type book of music you cannot beat any of Readers Digest piano books.

Yes there has been some rewrites to the story line and the characters, but this is not original. There is improvement in some other areas, but on the whole its not enough to keep me glued. The woman who plays Starbuck, obviously spent time reviewing her predecessors facial expressions and its quite obvious, instead of developing her own, one extremely noticable mention is when she hooks into apollos craft and drags the both of them back at the ship at an alaming rate, of which apollo questions this and Starbuck counters with a 'no, not really' the facial expressions she used is exactly like Dirk Benedict. The one real intriguing aspect to this series is the blonde cylon who has quite alot of human inside of her. There is looks of guilt, sadness and even a tiny bit of love if not lust, very unlike cylons. so heres to hoping the series turns out better then the mini."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why no Mac OS?","review":"WTF?!?!

Galactica is more of a straight drama with some sci fi which avoids many of the things I love about other sci fi series. There will be no exploration of different fantastic alien cultures on Galactica and that's too bad. It's more like West Wing than typical sci fi. That approach might be an attempt to attract more mainstream viewers, but I like more wonderous and fantastic sci fi series."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor package","review":"Universal didn't take the time to put this together correctly.

But I received the 2003 miniseries on DVD as a gift, and tried to approach it with an open mind.Afterwards I decided justice requires that producer Ron Moore be subjected to gratuitous and inhumane medical experiments, conducted by clumsy vivisectionsts in front of a warmly applauding audience. Footage of the event should be included as a special feature on all future releases of this DVD, and the director's commentary track should consist of three hours of his agonized screams.There's nothing I can add to the other one-star reviews here (if only I could give it zero). The ONLY good thing about this DVD is that it forced me to finally stop procrastinating and buy the boxed set of the original Battlestar Galactica."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did They Ruin it ???","review":"Why is this new Battlestar so annoying and vulgar?Its not innocent anymore!

This version is absolutely horrible. I watched the 1st episode with an open mind and was stone bored within minutes. While it's nice to the Zoot Suit himself, Edward James Olmos getting some work I can't help but feel pity for him and Mary McDonnell, who look pathetic in their costumes and tired performances. What's even worse is \\"Starbuck\\"; played by someone who cannot act out of a paper sack, just awful. That and the shaky cam, just don't cut it for me. I wish all of the camera negatives for this edition were destroyed by Ovions and those robot monkey-dogs? Muffits? Who cares. The original series is by far much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, pure and simple","review":"The Sci-Fi channel should be ashamed for unleashing this idiotic, sophomoric nonsense onto the viewing public.

I don't get the scifi channel, so I thought, what the heck, I'll try it out. I popped it in the DVD player and...fell asleep within the first 20 minutes. Eventually I struggled through the mini series, along with the first 4 or so episodes. Scifi shouldn't put a fan to sleep. 'nuff said. I've since been forced to sit through more recent episodes at friends' houses. and still I could only think of better ways to spend my time...like in the dentist's chair, at least there you're pretty much numb. Each episode left me bored, and maybe even a bit depressed. Certainly not at all entertained. Anyway, my recommendation-pick up doctor who, or any of the star trek series. if nothing else, they are entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ralph's Review of Battle Star Galactica Mini Series","review":"This series is more mature than the original.

They add depth to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"good mainstream TV for normal people not geeks","review":"Battlestar Galactica '03 is good mainstream TV for normal people. This isn't typical sci fi and that's why it's great. New Battlestar attracts normal people who love mainstream TV and not geeks who love childish cheese like Stargate, Trek, Babylon, Dr Who, and all that other geeky garbage. There's nothing cheesy or childish here. This is SERIOUS MAINSTREAM TV that doesn't stretch the imagination and that makes it adult and superior to the fantasy crap most sci fi geeks watch. The sci fi elements are largely down played so that things are normal and very close to reality. New Battlestar has characters who could just as well come from a reality TV show and not a work of fantasy. The plot captures the real tragedy of 911 and the war in Iraq. It isn't some complicated weirdo escapism show. It isn't funny. It's SERIOUS. Don't like this? Get a life! It's time to be mature and join the mainstream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"quite tedious","review":"I didn't hate this miniseries but it sure was hard to sit through all four hours of it. The special effects are well done but so much of the rest of it just fell flat. It's a sad and weird world we live in where Firefly and Farscape are gone and instead we get a tedious Battlestar Galactica which isn't really even Battlestar Galactica. Mark me up as one of those viewers who wanted very much to like this but couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss the original","review":"I enjoyed the mysticism of the original series and it's fun escapism. This new one has missed the charm of the old one. The new Starbuck just doesn't make me laugh as much as the original who would \\"bruise easily\\"! LOL! THAT was a fun series! It didn't take itself too seriously.

I guess I wasn't impressed.The current series is excellent. The characters are all complex rather than the typical one dimensional sci fi characters. Mary McDonnell as the president is especially compelling. I can see how someone looking for a fast-paced special effects filled, sci fi show with a thin plot would not like this series. This is definitely a more adult science fiction series. Each episode is essentially self contained, but the ongoing search for earth drives the larger story. I highly recommend Battlestar Gallactica."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your cash","review":"i wasn't impressed with this mini and i really wanted to like it. the picture quality of this dvd is awful and it's not worth the money. they couldn't even bother to label the extras disc!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Did you wonder how it all began?","review":"This is a great introduction to the latest re-incarnation (no pun intended!) of the Battlestar Galactica franchise.

Recommended for all fans of the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superbly written and filmed","review":"This is one of those rare series that has a great story line, fabulous acting and wonderful cinematography. The space scenes are just breathtaking. James Olmos and Mary McDonnell put on top-notch performances. At times my adrenaline was pumping, while at others it tugged on my heartstrings.Give this a chance, even if you're a die-hard fan of the original Battlestar Galactica and are worried about the gender changes of some of the characters. Set that aside and watch it with an open mind. It's a new series, and in my opinion superior to the original. I'm looking forward to seeing the new episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so sci fi miniseries","review":"This miniseries mostly appeals to those who get very excited about the word \\"new\\" being attached to a product. I'm not a huge fan of the original Battlestar Galactica so I was open to anything GOOD. This miniseries put me to sleep. I'm not interested in a \\"old show vs new show\\" debate but I watched the old show years ago and I'm here to tell anybody who claims that the old show characters lacked heart or feelings or a sense of tragedy or loss that they are dead wrong. Those are all in the original. What does this version have? Well the battles are quality fx. That's something although this version will be dated in time just as the original show has aged and this mini just doesn't hold a candle to shows like FARSCAPE. I'm all for 21st Century cutting edge sci fi but this mini left a great deal to be desired. I know there are those who are hungry for new Battlestar Galactica but you deserve better than this miniseries gave."},{"rating":"1","title":"buy Firefly instead","review":"I've just read the comments by the reviewer who \\"yawns\\" at the original Battlestar because it was largely a positive and \\"happy\\" program and complains that the original characters enjoyed life too much. That review is a good example of why I can't watch this thing over and over. I gave it a try and found it quite tedious. I can only take so much of unhappy characters wallowing in self-pity while the main plot moves at a snails pace episode after episode after episode. Talk about a \\"yawn\\"!I guess that makes me one of those bad people who like to enjoy life. Wallowing in self-pity and despair is not my idea of a good time. Feel free to yawn at me between your tears of self-pity, but I need more out of life and entertainment. Firefly has all the elements of quality entertainment and it's far better than this dreary mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but negative","review":"Maybe I'm just old. I grew up with a fun TV program called Battlestar Galactica which had a mixture of fun, adventure and a little morality. This new version is nothing but dark and negative. I cannot find a single positive feeling anywhere in this program. Every set is dark and dismal. Every character has nothing but negative attitude toward just about everything. Only Mary McDonnell shows any strength of character, and she is dying of cancer?! Earth is portrayed as a lie to convince the crew and survivors to follow their leaders. If there is any redeeming value to this program, please tell me what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"This new Galactica is fair at best.

Some nice hard Sci-fi touchs in the show - for instance - when a viper or ship zooms by in space, you don't hear the rush of jet engines (which of course would never happen in the vacuum of space). The new female 'Starbuck' is a bit much (she even chews on cheap cigars in deference to the Dirk Benedicts' original portrayal). but on the whole the characters seem to be believable and well developed. Edward James Olmos as Adama is excellent, and the XO is great as well (with some possible character flaws being exposed early on). The new incarnation of Baltar is especially interesting...is he well meaning or not?The DVD ads some deleted scenes that are roughly CGI animated, but interesting.Also, the new Cylons....Wow! One in particular is not hard to look at by any means :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series, Terrible Production","review":"I would have rated this 1 star, but the story is still so well done.This purchase has been a tremendous let-down for me. Not because of the series itself, which many others have so properly lauded, but because of the lousy production controls on this DVD.The audio tracks and video tracks are not in perfect sync, so it looks like the movie's been dubbed over in English. It's very distracting to watch this when the words you hear don't quite match up to the movements of the actor's mouths. I can't believe something of this poor a quality would be released for sale.Buy this only if you're desperate to see the original series, and are willing to put up with the appearance of a voice-over dubbed movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor mish mash","review":"Are you the kind of person who thinks while watching Otto Preminger's In Harm's Way \\"this film needs parts cribbed from Blade Runner, cribbed from the West Wing, shakier camera work, and the misleading title 'Battlestar Galactica' tacked on\\"?Me neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans of 911 who also like robots.","review":"Fans of the tragedy of 911 who also like robots should enjoy this series.

There are some exciting moments along the way, but most of the time it's dull. The pacing of the first part of this mini is especially slow. You'll need to see the mini before watching the series, but you should watch this on TV before you buy it.

They are glad that B.S.g. features newer hair styles. That's the mentality of too many fans of B.S.g. They reject older series based on hair. They don't understand that modern hair styles will look dated in the future. They also don't understand that hair just doesn't matter. I don't share their hair obsession. I can enjoy all types of entertainment and it doesn't bother me at all what style hair was worn in a particular time period. Modern hair just doesn't save this one for me. It's got so much mumbo jumbo in it that it's a mess. I lost interest. Firefly was a better series. The upcoming Serenity movie will feature new hair styles AND an entertaining story. That should please the shallow hair obsessed fans of B.S.g. and those of us who like entertaining Sci Fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Modern Sci-Fi Garbage.","review":"If the sleezy, crude, cigar huffing, drunken, vulgar, slovenly, characters featured in the show are at all representative of the overall escaping colonists, one can only hope the robot Cylons destroy the entire rabble before they can reach Earth. Few of the show's actors have any redeeming characteristics, either in the roles played or their own personal appearance. Typical of many movies today, the women are often depicted as absurdly macho and the men too whimpy to control their own bowel movements. And the show itself is steeped in political correctness and the gratuitous, unromantic, often dark, sex so often found in Sci-Fi Channel's recent programming. Perhaps I'm simply not brainwashed enough to truly appreciate this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD is poor.","review":"I ordered two copies of this DVD. I love the show and the story line. However, both DVDs I purchased had significant flaws in the viewing of the DVD, starting around the 2 hour to 2 hour 15 minute mark. At that point the DVD would stop, start, stop, frereze, start - continuously. The DVD could no longer be watched. Since it happened in two different DVDs I purchased, I assume there is somed problem with the actual recording, altho I am going to try it in my computer DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a reality show?! IT'S TOO MUCH LIKE REALITY!","review":"Battlestar follows the same trend as reality shows by serving up TV that's more \\"real\\" and less fantasy and escapism. \\"Reality\\" TV is the popular fad, but I still like fantasy and escapism."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Wing in space","review":"Science Fiction \\"geeks\\" used to be a brave lot. They were famous for having the courage to love their favorite show even if it seemed wacky to the mainstream. Now it seems that the geeks of today prefer shows that are mainly clones of other \\"normal\\" mainstream TV dramas. That's too bad. I miss the courage of a fan base that didn't care how wacky their favorite show seemed. I also miss the aspects of those shows that the mainstream found wacky. The new Battlestar Galactica tries too hard to be mainstream and \\"real\\" so it's too much like the West Wing/NYPD Blue for my taste. Somebody called it Sci Fi for those who don't like Sci Fi. I agree. That's why I can't get into it. I liked some of the ideas in this mini, but the abundance of typical mainstream TV drama elements killed it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still waiting on the first download","review":"I purchased the first episode in the season over four hours ago. The download just passed 51% completion, over a 20mbps (on my end) connection. It requires yet another video player. I am not overly impressed. If I ever complete the episode download maybe I will be, but I cannot see downloading the entire season and watching it through this thing, let alone should I want to rewatch any of the episodes at some point in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to getting my business","review":"Amazon made an extremely poor choice.

I only watched this new series just too see if it was any good, and I must say this is one of the most gritty sci-fi series I've had the plesure of watching.Gallatica feels like a real carrier type battle ship, and the concept that the Cylons can hack into and fry your computer systems if networked is not only great plotting it can really happen.However this Mini series does have it's problems. As a stand alone Mini series it ended way too short, but I'm really glad that they launched a TV show of the Mini series to continue this great story of survival against overwhelming odds."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the worst sci fi","review":"I do not agree with those critics who say this is the absolute worst. This is not the worst, but it's getting there. It's dull and falling apart as it goes. There's sex, decent fx, and some interesting actors being wasted. So far it's just slow, unfocused, and largely uninteresting. We really could use some good new sci fi on TV soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed opportunity","review":"This should have been so much better. I liked some of it (Olmos!)but they have a long way to go to improve many other things. Unfortunately from the 4 and 5 star reviews from fans I guess we can just expect more of the same from the series. I can't see having this in my collection to watch over and over but I may check out the new show and hope it's very different and much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IF YOU BUY SEASON ONE!","review":"This is a great miniseries. I loved it and highly recommend it. Unfortunately *** IT IS INCLUDED IN THE SET FOR SEASON ONE ***. I didn't read the reviews for season one before buying both, which would have clued me into this fact. Apparently EVERYTHING in the miniseries set is in the season one set too.I gave it a 1 star because I wasted my money buying this set and NOT because its a bad show. As I said above, its great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes all of the SG-1's look like garbage!!","review":"Finally, the Sc-Fi Channel shows an excellent sci-fi sries!Forget the terriblly boring SG-1 series, along with its lackluster Stargate Atlantis - The new Battlestar is far and above those two series put together. Grittier, filmed better, written better, acted WAY better - Galactica is sexy and sleek.You want action and adventure on a Hollywood scale? Look no further, pal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This mini-series is brilliantly written, filmed and acted. Every character is well developed, and the plot moves along quickly. The special effects are some of the best you'll ever see from a TV series. I'd recommend this to anyone who is even moderately interested in the genre.However, keep in mind that this series is very different than the original. It has a harder edge and deals with complex adult themes. This definitely isn't a story for the kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, convincing, and tense","review":"I rented this on a whim, having enjoyed the original series as an 11-year-old. I was surprised at how good the remake is. While I think even the most devoted fans of the original show would agree that there's a certain amount of cheesiness to that fine progmra, there's nothing cheesy at all about this new version. It's gritty, realistic, well written, well directed, and exceptionally well produced. There are just enough nods to the original series to keep the old fans amused and shouting at the screen \\"Oh, that's an original viper, oh, that's what the Cylons *used* to look like\\" but the show is completely updated in ways that just make sense. The people who can't control their rage that boomer and starbuck are now women: Get over it. Besides, that new Starbuck is the best character on the show, after the tough as nails Commander Adama.Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Miniseries EVER!!!","review":"I absolutly LOVE this miniseries. I wish I had seen it before. Its a must have! I dont even like space shows but I heard this was a pretty good show so I wanted to start to watch it... having Tahmoh Penikett and Edward James Olmos in it was just a perk. I think everyone should watch this miniseries, you will get hooked and want to see the rest of the series too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Are you alive?\\"","review":"One of the best opening scenes on the small, or big screen EVER.

And when I heard the were remaking it and read about some of the controversy (Richard Hatch, ironically, was not happy with the new show's direction) I had to watch it on TV.Initially I didn't know what to think -- it wasn't what I expected.But through the seasons I've become a complete BSG junky, finally convincing a friend to give it a try. So I bought the mini-series to give her a complete introduction and rewatching it really reinforced how great the show is. And how well conceived. Unlike LOST, BSG seems to have a firm direction and plan.I used to buy on iTunes, but Universal and Apple parted ways.Amazon's service isn't compatible with my iPod. But on balance, once I purchase from Amazon I can watch it online whenever I want...iTunes doesn't let you go back to retrieve a lost file.So love the show and happy with Amazon Box...now if only they could work out iPod compatibility :)."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like this but...","review":"I was bored out of my mind watching this. Is there some way we can get Farscape or Firefly back on? How about Space 1999 (great sense of mystery, fun, and no whiners), the Prisoner (another mysterious show and they didn't have to turn down the lights to create a sense of mystery), or even Buck Rogers (at least Buck was entertaining in own it's corny way). New Galactica tries oh so very hard to be serious and somber and we know it's trying to convey serious and somber because everything looks so dark most of the time. There's plenty of soap opera stuff in it too but without the high camp value of a good soap. Those who love somber and slow entertainment will like it. Others will wish it had more exuberance. I wish they'd bring back Dr Who!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sterile & hit and miss","review":"huge fan of dark sci-fi (DARK CITY, ALIENS) but didn't find this dvd captivating. it seems so sterile at times and then they hit you over the head with the 'angst' and it's too contrived. this is very hit and miss. sad that they didn't do this better."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.G. fans are in a category all their own","review":"Many B.G.s (Battlestar Galactica fans) are a fanatical and angry bunch who can't review this DVD without constantly attacking other people and other series in an attempt to prove that this show is \\"the best\\". Those who don't have the same view as the fanatical fans are treated like some kind of traitor to the cause. It's hard to get a fair view of this DVD.We are told by fans that the DVD deserves five stars even if it's sub par in many ways. We are told that we must buy this in order to be a \\"TRUE fan\\". Those who don't like this are said to be \\"obsessed\\" or \\"geeks\\" or worse. Nonsense! Be objective and not just hostile and fanatical.

This is the pilot to the TV series and it leaves many things unresolved so that the TV series can add even more things that are then also unresolved. Most of my questions from watching this mini are still not answered. Perhaps season two will be better? Let me know. I'm not going to waste any more time on this pointless series. There's some nice eye-candy on this show and that's about it. I really wanted to like it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"I have never seen the original. This new version is fairly enjoyable. There are a lot of good action sequences and an interesting plot. This miniseries is 90 percent sci fi action movie and 10 percent pathetic tear-jerker. There are a few scenes stuck in there just to elicit some emotion, but most were incredibly heavy-handed.There are a lot of good characters with one big exception. Dr. Baltar is whiney and annoying. (His \\"imaginary\\" friend doesn't help.) I prefer a bad guy to enjoy being bad, not whimper about getting caught and worry about how bad might be too bad.Most of the other characters are fun early on, when Galactica is about to be decommissioned and turned into a museum and strong later when circumstances change. It is interesting to see how they handle it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bridge until the DVD set came out & Season 4 starts.","review":"I have to say off the top, that Unbox does not work out of the box in Vista 64 bit, with out changing the compatibility mode to win xp.

If you like shows like star trek or any of its spin-offs, you will LOVE this show, it is WAY BETTER! And I am a huge star trek tng, ds9 and voy fan. Instead of using special powers, convenient technologies like replicators and transporters, and plot devices like the holodeck, the writers actually address real problems and work out strategies to solve them. You will quickly get addicted to the plot and the suspense of this show. It uses well known mythologies and astrology to relate their religion and political structures to our world. It is sad it had to end, but as a plot based on prophesy, it had to have a definite ending, and didn't disapoint. Oh, and I am a woman. Men, get your wives and girlfriends to watch it with you, even if they think they don't like sci-fi. The drama and romance is very satisfying for a female viewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"it has it all!!!","review":"i am a late-comer to this series, couldn't imagine a revamping of the old BSG series.

The complaints about the pacing are true and the writing could use improvement as could some of the characters. I could go on but it would only fall on deaf ears since GALACTICA, like all sci fi shows, has attracted a loving throng of followers many of whom think this pilot for the series is worthy of 5 stars. It's too bad GALACTICA fans can't be objective enough to note the problems and call for changes. This could be the start of something great but it seems that most of it's fans think that this is right up there with the very best Science Fiction as it is. I say there's room for much improvement and if this is the best GALACTICA can offer then GALACTICA isn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible dvd - don't be fooled","review":"This was put together in a very shoddy fashion. The picture quality is poorer than it should be and they did not label the extras disc and the deleted scenes are incomplete scenes in front of green screens! It's a TRAVESTY to put this shoddy DVD out and a LIE to give it five stars! They clearly just wanted to make a buck and didn't care about selling a DVD package of good quality with the best possible picture. It's sad that so many fans give this a five stars instead of being honest. Giving this thing a perfect score will only result in more crap. It's not as good as it should be and customers should know how lacking this really is.Interested in buying this?

After losing some of it's more...gritty shows, the Sci-Fi channel was in need of something like this. The cast is excellent, and the characters seem to be real people with real problems. The miniseries: fabulous. The best thing about it is the characters. They are real. When they get hurt, it's not made \\"all better\\" by some technology, and though they are an advanced civilization, they are often petty, if not downright selfish people.The dynamic between Starbuck and Apollo is one of the best examples of on-screen chemistry there is. You can feel that they are best friends, each other's other half, but you can also see underlying tones of something more.I have been more impressed with this miniseries (now a series) than any other show pilot, ever. I believe it's one heck of a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy PQ but great series","review":"As others have said, this set is included in the Season One set, so don't buy this separate version.

The fabulous shot of Elvis and Liberace, as well as the shots of Sinatra and Mae West are all unbelievable treasures. I don't know how these guys found all this stuff, but my hat is off to them.

But listening to it in the year 2006, you can't help but think how many times this style of Swedish Death/Thrash Metal has been done to death already. A few interesting solos and the quality drum work is what kept me listening to this, not to mention the crystal clear production that gives the music the room and ambience it needs to flow.

But \\"Kicking in the Water\\" really captures their live sound, and the essense of the band. Buy that album instead, and download First Day of Spring from somewhere else. \\"Soap Bubble\\" is an OK album too, but not solid top to bottom. I was majorly dissappointed with Sold for A Smile.
