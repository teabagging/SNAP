By and large, it's a greatest hits album; most of what you can say, you've already said with their respective albums.On this, you get 3 new songs. Sometimes It's A..., Love's A Hard Game To Play, and Desert Angel. The first two are real rock staples, which end up being great, and Desert Angel sounds rock, too, but pop as well. That's the tribute to the troops during Operation Desert Storm, I believe, and it's a nice tribute. Overall, nice additions that prevent the album from just being a throwaway greatest hits album. You know how it goes.The three new songs are great additions, but what makes this album an absolute REQUIREMENT for any Stevie fan is that it has the radio version of Stand Back, which is stereophonic with more epic drums and a far more prominent synthesizer. ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stevie rocks","review":"I started listening to Stevie Nicks when I was 17 years old (or, actually, as hoky as this sounds, on the edge of seventeen, honestly!) and haven't stopped since. Speaking of Edge of Seventeen, it is one of my all time favorite Stevie songs. Great guitar riff, piano, vocals, energy & lyrics. And nothing beats playing this song cranked in the car when driving, as with Stand Back. I prefer this album's remixed version of Stand Back alot better than the original version, it sounds like all those synthesizers were mixed together properly for this album. The songs are Stevie's hits from the '80's mixed together with three '90's tracks. The sequencing has a nice flow and there are no weak tracks.If you love Stevie and want all her hits on one album, buy this one and crank it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor description","review":"I would rate the condition as poor, not as described.

The fact that he would even consider murder is revealing.Look to other cases where juveniles commit murder, are incarcerated until they are 21 and let go. Usually they are in trouble with the law or become violent with others. If you are capable of murder at 15, what can you do at 21? Society needs to be protected from these people.It's shocking that there is no consideration given the parents.Let's all feel sorry for the murderer!

I owned every version from start to finish, but with the lack of support, it is sad this software has gone by the wayside. I still have this book for sentimental reasons, and recommend it to anyone who still wants to use Hotdog Pro for their work, but if the program ever came back from the dead to what it was, I would so be first in line for upgrades.

There is a 30-day \\"Normal Wear Parts\\" Guarantee, so I'll have to check that out.UPDATE: Had to have the electric motor replaced, luckily under warranty, because the repair was more than the original price I paid.

Bad idea. Used it twice the first year ok. A fair bit of snow would always come out the front of the unit and land on the side you had just cleared - frustrating. The second year the motor started slowing on the first job and then stopped and smelled like it was burning. The motor is supposed to have thermal shutoff protection but that never seemed to work. I let it cool off and got it to start again by spinning the motor by hand - real convenient! It stopped again and smelled like it was burning again. Can't get it restarted.

Both my girls LOVE books, and will spend a lot of time sitting quietly reading. I would not say that my girls are BEHIND developmentally at all, I would say this leap pad is WAY off on the recommended age. My husband and I are both willing to sit with them to work on this, but they just don't seem to care about it. It is not fun for them at at all.

All she wants to do is rip the book off the holder and try to \\"read it herself\\".I will say that the pages are durable, and do not tear. I think the book is a little too advanced for the age groups listed. Possibly 2 or 2.5 yr olds would have a better attention span, and the knowledge to push the graphics to get the audio feedback from the book.One other thing is that every time you turn the page, you have to \\"push\\" the a green button on the page, so the pad knows what page you are on - I don't know how good any child under the age of 3 would be with this - so most reading would have to be \\"with an adult\\" - otherwise - the child just does not get anything out of the book.I personally like the pad (and it's books) and hope that in time, our daughter will get more out of it.

As other reviewers point out, the concept of pushing objects on a flat page (and pushing HARD) is lost on my little one. I won't even go into the GO button function. Since she knows how to make board books \\"work\\" on her own, she is less than enthusiastic about sitting on my lap and going through it with me.I spoke with a friend of mine who's baby is a bit older (20 months) and she is just now getting to the point of handling this toy.All and all, I'm planning on putting this away and hoping to bring it out to a better reception in about a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy It!

Buck has been announcing for the Cardinals since the mid-1950's and spent many of those years with another hall-of-famer named Harry Caray. Jack provides the reader with insights into his army career prior to entering baseball, his many years as an announcer for KMOX radio in St. Louis, and those glorious years with the Cardinals of the 1960's and 1980's. He also provides us with his opinions on the changes that have taken place in both baseball and the world from what it used to be. You don't have to be a Cardinals' fan to enjoy this book. If you enjoy baseball history, reading a book written by the much-respected Jack Buck is an enviable treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating read","review":"This book really comes at sports from a perspective few think about.

I put baking soda between the pages and let set for a couple of months, put it outside in the sun, etc. but most of the smell remains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventurous music","review":"This is a fantastic album that shows Braxton in a variety of formats, from solo to quintet, as well as on a variety of horns (sopranino, clarinet, piccolo, and alto). The recording quality is very good, and the sideman on this album are on top form, particularly bassist Dave Holland (who plays on three tracks) and trumpeter Kenny Wheeler (who plays on two tracks). Each track is interesting, but the most compelling playing is on the Dave Holland composition Four Winds. On this track, the band is the same as on the great _Conference of the Birds_ album, except the trombonist George Lewis replaces Sam Rivers. This album is great for anyone who enjoys, or is curious about, free improvisational music. The only downside is that there are none of the great diagrams that Braxton usually employs to name his tunes.Other: Six tracks - two for solo alto saxophone, three for quartets of various compostion, and one cello/clarinet duet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Light, Flexible Use","review":"I am always on the lookout for LED lights and I have several bikes. This light is bright and works just fine on my bike. I think it is more of a \\"be seen\\" head light than a \\"see\\" light. I was almost hit by a wrong-way biker the first night, but at least he could see me. I haven't tried the light as a lamp on my head, but I like the option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I use this as part of my night-riding gear and it is great. Having a light that shines with your gaze is invaluable --and its light weight is a luxury. The mounting options that came with the light were unimpressive however. After tinkering with them for a bit, I used an ordinary velcro strap which I threaded through two front vents on my helmet. I clipped the light onto that and have been very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"bracket broke","review":"- Here is a nice link to compare the brightness of the Planetbike lights:[...]- The plastic mount for helmet was broken when I tried to tight it on my helmet...Good thing is they sell the replacement parts for $3: [...]. So, don't do the same mistake i made...- I mounted on the bike, it is definitely more than \\" to be seen \\" light. At the angle I mounted light comes to my eyes...you might consider to put an opaque tape to block the light or change the mounting angle- I didnt like the switch. It is a little bit too stiff and if you push it too hard you may break the bike mount.Make sure to counterbalance the downward force you are applying by holding the mount from the opposite side of the switch..Perhaps you shouldnt do this while biking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Light","review":"I've added this light to my collection to fill in those spots where my headlights don't hit. This light is great when you're on a curvy bike path to light up where you are going. It has 3 options. Wide angle, focused and all on. I usually use the all-on setting as it provides both a focused and wide angle view. It was easy to mount to the helmet, although the strap can be a bit small, but it will work with a bit of trial and error. I also like how it comes with a headstrap, so I can use it around the house. As for the light itself. It's very bright and definitely fills in the dark spots on the trail. Plus it's very useful for aiming towards drivers that are about to turn in front of you, it catches their attention. It's very lightweight and combined with the helmet taillight, I don't notice the extra weight at all. I highly recommend this for anyone who does commuting both on dark bike trails and on city and residential streets."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed on first use","review":"Looks good and works fine - once -The small on / off and selection switch failed with the first usage. It is far too fragile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and convenient","review":"I'm very satisfied with this light. The benefits are:-- Since I always have my helmet, now I always have a light, even if I forget my other lights.-- It's pretty bright; I can see the reflection off traffic signs several blocks away.-- The reflector design makes it pretty visible from a wide angle, more so than my bike headlamp.-- The on/off switch \\"remembers\\" which of the four modes you were last using (full on, blinking, center LEDs, or side LEDs).-- Anything that gets more attention is good!Things that could be improved are:-- Some way to adjust the angle. Right now I shove some rubber under the bottom of the light to get it up to the angle I want.-- A separate mount for the helmet strap and head strap. Right now to use it as a head lamp, I would have to completely remove the mount from my helment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love dino dan","review":"Got this for my Kindle so the kids can watch it while we go on appts and such they love dino dan :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Dino Dan","review":"I just love this Dino Dan.

(This is probably what sold the publisher on the idea of a reference book.) But as the book continues, the lists become more and more inane to the point of insulting the reader. Toward the end of the book, the format morphs into a paragraph or so on a subject followed by a page of lists of such hard-to-know things as the colors of children's eyes and hair. Also since each word in the list is a dot floating in a sea of whitespace, some pages in the book don't have a 100 words on them. If they removed the lists and reduced the size and price of the book by half, it would probably be worth buying.I really get the impression that the authors lost their way on this list concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is my cics bible/has save me time more than once","review":"this book is a real gem, it is a must for any cics programmer. mine has a ton of tabs so i can find the commands that i use most often"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad sound","review":"I hate this phone.

It's not the voice echoing typical of 2.4GHz digital phones...more of a hissy lingering of words. People on the other end said I sounded fine, but what I was hearing on my end was really annoying. Incoming volume wasn't even as good as an old VTech 9211 I have. The one feature I DID like is when another phone on the same line is being used, \\"Extension In Use\\" is displayed on the LCD.

Since nothing is in-depth, I'm not really sure what the point of this book is as it adds nothing new to the field. It's great Ronald and June Shelp own all these pieces, but so what?

I think the thing that really did it for me with this recording was the heavier use of a male vocal. Although I thoroughly enjoy their female vocalists, adding the male in more a leading role was brilliant, especially on their two duets.I was totally inspired when I heard Verekai's calliope-synth-tympanic melodies and enjoyed the performance equally. If you have listened to Cirque in any measure, you'll know that each recording shares similarities, but each progresses down its own path. I think that's why their music continues to sell so well - new ideas, yet conceptually similar.Bravo Cirque!!

If so, I doubt I'll buy more CDs (huge shame because I have every CD for the shows that I've seen - 4 or 5 travelling shows & 3 theatre shows)."},{"rating":"2","title":"In true Crique form, this album is a work of art.","review":"I am a little disappointed with the some of the reviews posted here. I have been truly pleased with this album. Sure it doesn't replace the show experience. But not even the DVD can replicate a Cirque expereince.I think people were expecting to re-live the Varekai experience through this CD. But most don't realize that this is Cirque Du Soleil we're talking about. Always striving to push the boudaries of artistic expresstion and sound. This CD easily takes listeners to the next level of thought. Trying to extrapolate a concrete definate meaning out of music like this is like trying to explain what art is. It just can't be done.I enjoyed this album and will continue to wait and see what Cirque has in store for this unique and enchanting show."},{"rating":"1","title":"What might have happened","review":"At the last minute the lead singer for the show was fired. That might explain why the songs on the CD are a bit different from the ones in the show. That said, however, the music is still mindblowing. Eerie melodies and amazing vocals that lift the spirits. I'm a big big fan all of the Cirque soundtracks and this is no exception. I can't wait to see the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay to start with","review":"This is a book u buy if you are just looking to findout what vb is all about it doesn't go indepth at all and gave some topics in a very bad form it is just a scrath on the surface but it is okay if u don't really want to apply the knowledge you are supposed to be gaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"VB6 in 24 hours... kinda","review":"As an old DOS programmer that left the field because of Windows programming demands, I was pleasantly surprised at the ease one can program in VB6. This book, however, was not a good investment. It's true you get what you pay for. There's a number of code and editing errors here that one can lose time scratching one's head over. I'd suggest going with the Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 Learning Edition instead. Despite a higher investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"Having read some of the articles being written about this book, it made me think. The title of this book should give the person the idea what he/she is getting into. It is giving you the basics in the quickest time possible, nothing more. So why all the ado?This book is good for re-hashing or for someone new to VB as a supplement to what the student may be getting from a class room or work. Nothing more, and for that it works well. With a title such as \\"Sams Teach Yourself in 24 Hours\\" would you expect to be an awesome programmer? You won't. Will it help you as a supplement to a class or work? It will.Some of the criticisms of this book are really not called for. It is for all intents and purposes a decent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it!","review":"After reading through hour 7 (a fair 100 pages) I was completely bogged down with this book. It spends 4-5 pages explaining focus (something any windows user understands in about 2 seconds) then races through 4-5 pages of solid terms with no explaination as to why they are important or to what use they will be. This makes understanding very difficult and also makes for a very boring read. Very disapointed with this purchase and would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Computer Stands At Idle As You Read","review":"The book for most part has good information for beginners but I found your reading code more than your \\"actually\\" doing hands on programming with Visual Basic.The only thing that appealed to me to buy it was the control creation edition 5 on the CD. Lucky for me I bought another book from Microsoft Press by Micheal Halvorson the step by step guide, now it makes more sense. If you buy this edition, you may want another book which you can learn \\"Hands on\\". You spend more than 8 chapters reading before any real exercises surface in this book. That's way too long, and little boring if your first starting out. Just buy it for the CCE, and start with another book, works for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled in most of the holes","review":"I had a basic knoledge of vb and some knoledge of random advanced topics befoer i read this book. After I read this book, it willed in all the holes that i never learned about and allowed me to move on to move advanced books. The reason that is had 4 stars, not 5 is because in the last few chapters, it goes through advanced topics without explaining it. I recomend this book for beginners and beginner-intermediates."},{"rating":"1","title":"curly covers","review":"In the paperback version, this book's covers curl away from the book!

I recomend staying away from the 24 hour books they either try to put everything in 24 lessons or streach it to that. You need more than 24 lessons to really learn vb.

If you're just starting programming in Visual Basic 6, then this is definately the book for you. It is filled with step-by-step instructions and helpful hints that will get you started on the right path. Plus, it teaches the lessons in easy to understand descriptions, so it doesn't take too long to learn. This book was my starting point, and it did me a lot of good, so I'm suggesting this book to anyone interested in the profitable programming business. I'd also like to recommend Dan Appleman's book on the Windows 32-bit API, which will further your knowledge in more difficult application coding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it says and not for the novice!","review":"This book will not have you cranking out VB apps in 24hrs. I expected a series of hands on exersizes walking you through creating applications. THIS BOOK WILL NOT DO THAT FOR YOU! If you know nothing about VB stay away from this book. What it is a long-winded explanation of VB and how different aspects of it work. This is not for the novice and will not teach you to build apps. There are no projects that will produce running VB apps in this book.If you want hands on practice and step-by-step instructions for building apps then get SAMS \\"Teach Yourself Visual Basic is 21 days\\". \\"VB in 21 days\\" is 21 hands on lessons in building VB apps and writing code and is excellent for beginners. The lessons start out easy and get progessively more difficult as the lessons progress until at the end you are writing fairly complex apps."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to become a professional debugger in 9 hours or less.","review":"Well I first became interested in VB after seeing what could be done in a short amount of time as compared to other languages such as C/C++ (which I have studied for about 2 years). The book starts off like any other book, however it gets worse as it goes on. The first couple chapters (1-8) are decent, showing you code, explaining things, and having you actually do some of the projects. In chapter 9 however things start to change. Errors in his code start to become annoying and your projects won't compile. Later in chapter 11 he begins talking about subjects such as the Timer Control and provides no code to show you how to interact with it. After chapter 11 the author just seemed to loose his esteem and eventually lost mine too. I also wouldn't recommend buying the Teach your VB in 21 Days book either as it is written by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visual Basic Commercial","review":"This book does an excellent job of singing the praises of VB's interface without giving away any of the code to make them useful. Consider it more of an overview to Visual Basic, but dont plan on learning any script here."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Money Well Spent on Microsoft Product Promotion","review":"Even if you got this on sale as I did, I think you'd be better off saving your money as well as your time by getting VB Step By Step by Micheal Halvorson. The Halvorson book happens to be published by Microsoft Press, but the author likes to teach programming and shows you VB by code examples; he is also objective and doesn't waste your time making obsequious praise and promotion of Microsoft brand PRODUCTS as this Sams book does. Unless of course you like paying money to read advertising copy telling you how great Microsoft is and why all its products are flawless. Funny, because I thought this book was going to be a book on programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather dull..","review":"I actually learned more VB stuff in Access 97 than I did in this book.

I found the opening chapters over explained and repetitive, but despite my incredible boredom i forced myself to move on. I eventually read up to about chapter 10 when i became totally confused. The provided examples would sometimes not work, and it left me frustrated. So there i was, stranded in the middle of this book, consed, bored and frustrated.

However, the previous reviewer was right that the glass is too lightweight and plastic-looking, and might be misconstrued as flimsy. But I am not holding this \\"bad\\" feature against it. On the contrary, I like it precisely because it is not heavy. Although, the durability question remains to be answered yet. For the price I paid, this is a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unacceptable","review":"This product is extremely cheaply made.

However, it's not even 3 weeks later and the vacuum seal has already broken and created condensation on the inside of one glass, even though I keep them wrapped up in bubblewrap in my drawer. Needless to say I'm pretty disappointed with the quality. I bought some 2.5 ounce bodum tea glasses, however, and despite their small size, the silicone plugs in them allow better \\"breathing\\" so the glass doesn't crack or score and break the vacuum seal.

That said..they are super lightweight, it almost feels like you are going to break them (although none have). They are great for insulating, you can put something really hot in them, and the outside of the glass is perfectly normal.But they are way too small to be usable by any current American standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really impressed with them.","review":"The product dimension is listed completely wrong. The glass is about 4 1/2 inches tall, bottom is about 2 1/2 inches wide and mouth is about 3 1/4 inches wide. It is taller and slimmer than pictured. I guess because it is so light it felt a little like a clear acrylic cup instead of glass. If you use this for a 2 cup coffee from a senseo machine, you coffee will overflow because it is smaller inside. Overall, I was expecting a more elegant looking glass than it actually is. They are not worth the price listed. But since I got such a great deal buying 4 sets for the price of 1 set, I'm going to keep them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not pretty but Functional","review":"Cons:1. These are not pretty (at least to me). There is too much empty space along the base between the 2 glass walls. It looks weird.

Some of the other reviewer comments had me really worried.2a. They do what they say.. hot drink dont feel hot, yet stay hot for longer.2b. Cold drinks dont mist up the outside glass wall and stay colder for longer.3. Very light. I hate heavy stuff, that why I'm a Corelle fan.Facts:1. If you drop them.. they will break. They are fragile!!With great features comes great responsibility, so please be very careful.2. They hold 10ounces of fluid which is as much liquid as a regular mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this set if you want high quality latte glasses","review":"This is my first time I have the motivation to write down product review since this product is totally disappointed and made by very poor quality. The first one is that the shape is terrible, not as described as the website pictures. When I saw these at first glance, I almost thought Amazon mails the wrong item. The second one is that these glass are pretty fragile so once you use hot water to clean these cups, they are broken easily. If you want to get high quality and stylish latte glasses, I will strong recommend Bodum.

However, that may have been the signal to the machine. It simply stopped working on 12/16. Nothing I did got it going again. Unplug it, plug it back in, reload drivers, press any of the 3 buttons on the scanner, etc., nothing. It became a too-big paperweight and I only had it for about 2 months (and didn't have the invoice any more, drat). I guess it was too light weight to keep scanning comic books.

High resolution, relatively high-speed scanning, no external power cord, compact. Besides a few minor software glitches, it seemed too good to be true.To complete the tawdry cliche, it was. A few months out, it got stuck. That is, the scanning mechanism literally got stuck to the front edge of the scanner. It made funny noises and stopped working. Dead.As an example of the poor workmanship, when you press one of the buttons on it firmly, but not hard enough to break any decent piece of electronics, the mechanism moves. That is, the scanning mechanism is indirectly attached to the buttons you push to turn it on! Try it at a store display! When the mechanism moves by a firm button press, the extremely thin metal rod that holds everything in place bends like a piece of wire in a [garbage] compactor. That can't be good.Although the scanning itself is fine, this scanner is extremely flimsy and is sure to break after a sure period of normal use."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Disaster","review":"I was attracted by its slim design and the canon name.

They are poorly integrated and guaranteed to crash even the best maintained system. They are not supported by the software companies who refuse to provide updates for \\"bundled\\" versions. None of these applications works well -- if at all -- in System X or in Classic and updates are not available, despite Canon's assurances.

The song was the signature ballad behind his 1993 album, Both Sides. The song is very mellow and simple, a constant to several of Phil's biggest songs in the 1980's.

This book is not wonderful, but it is not awful either. It falls somewhere in the middle. Just okay. The beginning of the story where Rosa (heroine) is watching her friend Jason propose to her other friend Linda is hoaky and awkward. The middle of the book, where Wiggs describes the childhood relationship between Rosa (heroine) and Alex (hero) was the best part of the book. Then the reunion when they are adults seems predictable and boring. And the accident mystery I had solved chapters before Wigg's intended. Too predictable, and much of the writng was cliche and corney for me. Grade C-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kodak I1320 Scanner","review":"This scanner is great! Highly recommended.

They sound crisp and clear and offer plenty of room for a larger amp if needed. The install was a breeze as the speakers come with a very gummy tar to coat the speaker connections to protect them from the elements. The mounting bracket is sturdy and easily adjustable with the nob that can be loosened and tightened to change speaker direction.

I think that another design would be easier to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, flimsy, and brittle - waste of money!!!","review":"Don't waste your money and make the same mistake I did. The first red flag was when I had installed the batteries and the unit failed to turn on. A good palm slap on the side fixed that problem. A big problem with the unit is the lack of ergonomics. It is very awkward to hold without touching the lamp itself.The worst happened when the time actually came to cleaning out the actual stains on a linoleum floor, which unsurprisingly, requires both hands! This unit has NO good base to set it down on the floor and maintain the light on the spot being cleaned. Did i mention that the light beam is rather narrow and total darkness is needed to even see the stains to begin with? Long story short, after I'd set down the light on its edge while wiping down one of the walls, the unit fell over and shattered the light.Don't waste your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague","review":"This product is the worst thing I've ever purchased. Shoddy construction, barely cast anylight. Barely could see any trace of anything on the wall even though I knew there was urinethere. Had to get another light from a different co. HUGE waste of money not to mention the8 batteries needed for it to waste my time. Avoid like the plague!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works really well","review":"This product works really well.

You may not WANT to see all the pet spots it'll reveal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Illuminates cat pee and is good value","review":"Having some troubles with a sick cat, I needed a blacklight. This product already had good reviews and was priced reasonably. I've no prior experience with this application, but I can say that in darkened rooms this does the job perfectly. It's not bright enough for use in the middle of the day, but in evening or at night, it does just what we need.

It works very well...almost too well. I was horrified to see the extent to which our dog had soiled the carpet.

I highly recommend this light to anyone who has a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"finding cat pee in the middle of the night","review":"the light worked great for finding all the places that my cat had sprayed. it works so well that it picks up other spots that have been cleaned previously so you have to figure out which is which but after that it works quite well. it's a product that you really don't want to use but it really showed all the places that my cat had marked in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a strong UV light, not particularly useful","review":"Light shows only when completely dark. Not necessary urine stains, mainly anything white will glow. So white residue from water stains will glow also. Not very useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dim Light and Cheap Flimsy Design.","review":"It is as if this were designed so it would be broken. Flimsy design awkward to hold and use without a grip or handle or even a safety tether to hang on to. You have to be very careful not to drop the unit as there is no comfortable place to place your hands as you do not want to touch the long bulb. My bulb was not very bright perhaps it was engineered that way :). It takes 8AA batteries and although you can use an AC adapter, no AC adapter was supplied. This product is overpriced, I would expect to pay about $9 for something like this. I did see stains, so it does seem to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"In spite of positive reviews, which I always check before buying, this thing did not live up to its claim. Although it uses 8 AA batteries, the light is extremely dim and almost impossible to see if you are also trying to hold the light. Although the carpet was clearly pet stained on the backing, and smelled bad, the detector did not show anything different from any place else. I was hoping from something a little more definitive, so have to say this did not work for me. The plastic casing was also extremely flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dim and flickers - not useful at all","review":"I bought this to spot where my devil cat had been peeing. In order to use it, even at night, I have to close all curtains and turn off every single tiny source of light -- it's that dim. It also flickers, so I can't consistently see the stains. It's awful, a waste of my money, and now I have to spend more money to get a better, professional-quality light that will work for my needs (because my cat is still the devil). Wouldn't buy anything from this brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with this","review":"I bought this to help me identify areas that my house broken resistant dog might have done his thing. It works great for this. It is not perfect. I need to turn the lights out and get fairly close to what I am looking at but then any urine stains glow like crazy. If you read the reviews, none of these are perfect. Most people seems to love the one they bought but some hate the very same one with a passion. Because of this, I bought this one locally so I could easily return if if I hated it. No need for that. I am very pleased with it. It does take a boat load (8) of AA batteries, so that could be better. Still I am pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly constructed, but works","review":"We can definitely use this item to locate otherwise-invisible traces of cat urine but the bulb fits into the plastic sheath really badly, it's very loose. I have to basically hold the bulb in place manually in order to complete the circuit & get power to the light. So it's awkward to use!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Ineffective","review":"Even after knowing exactly where my cat uninated this product did not even faintly illuminate the stain. I can't understand the other reviewers of this item giving this product anything but a big zero. I sent it back promptly for a refund. I hate a ripoff. I would have given it a minus 5 if that had been possible. I irks me even to give it one star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"My cat has urinated in one area so much that I can smell the stench as soon as I walk into the room. In an effort to remove all of the urine at one time, in hopes that she wouldn't re-mark the same spot, I purchased this light. It showed zero urine stains. I have wood floors, and upholstered furniture, and stains showed nowhere in the very stinky room. It was completely worthless. I'm taking it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome...ly bad","review":"This item did exactly what I wanted it to. I was looking for a UV light that would work for a few days, then spill battery acid and become inoperable, thus wasting my money and the many batteries it requires to operate. An added feature I enjoyed was the door to where they batteries are inserted. It doesn't close correctly, and gives you the opportunity to use the tape of your choice to keep it shut. I used electrical tape! Such joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING - CHEAPLY MADE!","review":"The product didn't work right out of the box. When I finally got the light to work - kept turning off on it's own - it didn't even shine enough black light on the carpeting to show me where a possible \\"accident\\" might be. I put the light right over a spot where I was sure an \\"accident\\" was and nothing, nadda, zippo. Total waste of money! Do not purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase","review":"This item did not work once the batteries were installed but the overall quality was so poor that it was really no shock that it didn't actually work. Very cheap plastic and would probably break quickly even if it had actually turned on."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work on dark carpet","review":"We have very dark maroon-colored carpets throughout our entire upstairs and I found an area our new cat urinated on in an upstairs bedroom. I bought this to see if there were other spots he used in that room since I haven't been able to get the smell out. Nothing except lint shows up on this color carpet. I did find a lot of splatter-looking things on the walls, but I had to crawl around and actually sniff the entire carpets upstairs to see if he had used other spots, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place. Downstairs where we have lighter carpets it did light up in the one area I know he used down there and had already treated, and it is kind of fun to use--you almost feel like a forensic detective (I was horrified at our toilet). But overall it wasn't very helpful to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gimmick that doesn't work?","review":"I had a rug that my cat had peed on and I was trying to find and wash all the spots really proactively. The rug had a carpet pad underneath it. With this light I could BARELY see any spots on the carpet pad, and you can just forget about finding anything on the uneven surface of a carpet! Now that's a problem because I had been putting paper towels down between the carpet pad and the rug and those spots I could see with my own eyes...for a lot less than $20 and a cabillion AA batteries! There are also spots I know about and can smell very clearly that this thing still won't pick up, so for my purposes it is not finding anything I couldn't have found myself AT ALL. Maybe it would work on hardwood floors, but then it'd be cheaper just to walk about in socks and see where your socks get wet. :P I want my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My dog is getting older and she is losing control of her bladder. I got this light to try to find out where she has been leaking so I could clean up after her. I checked around where she always lays down.......nothing showed up. One day she got up and wanted to go out. I patted her rump and it was wet. I grabbed the light and ran it over her backside and......NOTHING. It did not fluorese as it was supposed to. I checked the place that she just got up. The carpet was wet. Shone the light on the area.......NOTHING! I know it was her urine, it smelled like her urine but this light did nothing. Don't waste your money on this item. It MAY have worked for other people(???) but not for me. Take your chances folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a standard blacklight it seems","review":"Don't think there's anything special about this, just a blacklight, which sort of works to spot urine, though you have to get pretty close to see anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"It worked like it supposed to","review":"I was happy with the way the Simple Solution Spot Spotter Ultraviolet Urine Detector helped me locate my cat's urine spots so I could attempt to clean them up.

This was very disappointing. Don't bother buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for Cat Urine","review":"We have not used the urine detector a lot but it definitely detects cat urine.

Thanks to this light I no longer have lingering urine smells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all I thought it would be.","review":"The detector was simple enough to use, although it required alot of batteries(8). But the results were mixed. Urine markings were faint and hard to distinguish from other organic substances.

My house was aglow! Fortunately, we found the fine print that said that not only would cat urine show up, but cleaning agents as well. It then goes on to explain the different colors.

Now my house is still \\"aglow\\", but it smells great and the \\"splatter lights\\" are from cleaning agents rather than Fluffy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This works well!","review":"First we tried a flashlight-style UV light which barely disclosed anything. THEN we used this UV fluorescent-type light. It was so thorough at showing where our puppy had gone that it was SCARY! It even showed where we had splashed some aquarium water on the carpet. This light left no boo-boo undisclosed, and we were able to treat ALL needed areas with the OUT! enzymatic cleaner. Perfect solution - no stains & no odor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and works well.","review":"My cats decided to pee everywhere except the litter box. I had no idea how bad the problem was until I got this product. The smell should have given it away.

It would have been impossible to try and clean without seeing the spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless!","review":"I wish I had used this item before the return window closed because when I went to use it, it wouldn't work.

They're nothing special, but they're not advertised as such either. Although a cotton/polyester blend, they don't feel as \\"scratchy\\" as some blends do. And they are cut a bit narrow and long, which helps keep them tucked in and keeps the cuffs from riding up the wearer's arms. I like the color choices (black and grey in addition to standard off-white), and the moderate price especially with the free shipping offer that applied to my order of 3 shirts.If you're looking for an ultra-heavy thermal top for extreme conditions, this shirt will not do.

At first, I found the book confusing, as I didn't realize that the same characters' lives were being shown in all three phases, but once I figured it out, I thought it was a great way to write a book. In the Shadow of Suribachi is hard to read because of the graphic narratives of the veterans' pre-, during, and post-war experiences (some strong language), but it is an important book, because we must realize what war does to its victims, whether we approve of war or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"This book is a must read.

After having my gallbladder removed, I found that taking the NAC helped relieve all of the discomfort that remained after the surgery. I had been taking Village Green Apothecary's in-house brand with excellent results. Once I moved away from Maryland, I purchased the Jarrow brand and began to notice horrific heartburn within 45-60 minutes of taking the NAC. I have no idea why this brand is triggering heartburn, but I am certain that it is. I tested this on 5 different occassions to determine that it was, in fact, the Jarrow NAC and not something else. I had to discontinue use. Plus, I did not experience the same beneficial results with the Jarrow brand that I did with the Village Green Apothecary in-house brand. However, my mom did not experience the same negative results that I did, so that's why I give the product 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 hp Tecumseh engine snowblower","review":"This snowblower is woefully underpowered.

If you are considering just one DT album, this is the one to cut your teeth on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intresting, but way too much musical indulgence.","review":"Hmmn, a band that combines old school progressive rock like Rush, Kansas, and Yes, and combines metal like Metallica and Queen-something. Queensryche? Yeah, that's their name. Well, anyway, I smell failure.And I sort of did.This album, while it has its moments, failed to impress me. There were too many musicial parts and not enough of the songs. I understand that they're a progreesive rock band, but they need some direction. Ok, Another Day, Surrounded,, Pull Me Under, and Wait For Sleep is good, in fact, great, but the other go on and on until you just want to skip it. Oh well, maybe I got one of the bad albums. I hope next time they'll be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the movie Star Wars, you will LOVE this album!","review":"Why? because they are both the best of the best of the best style... it's simple as that! if you like rock music, you like music that is less good then this Progressive metal style, if you like metal, so it's the same. and this is the best of this style, and this style is the best of rock, so if you like this style, or rock... this album is the best! simple ah? just buy it, it has a really nice cover too so it's a small piece of art from both ways, inside and outside!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cheesy","review":"I love Dream Theater, but this just disappoints me. As someone said before me, this is way too 80s for me. Some highpoints of the album are Take the Time, Pull me Under, and Metropolis Part 1. The rest is basically cheesy filler. I hate Wait for Sleep, I can't stand Surrounded, and there's not much else on the album I can stand.For a proper introduction, try something like Train of Thought of you're a metalhead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I am a big fan of heavy metal so when I heard about a metal band that used lots of keyboard I thought that they would suck.

I was listening to Images and Words ever since 92, when it came out, and 7 years after it's release it still always finds a way into my CD player.

This CD is a compliment to humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I hadn't heard of them before...and when I did, it was because I heard \\"Take the Time\\"...my brother had bought the CD. It's a brilliant band, still showing that there are people capable of treating music with the respect it deserves. John Petrucci, Kevin Moore, John Myung, and Mike Portnoy- this is a band with top-class names that brings on constantly top-class music. Amidst the lightning-quick finger movements racing along fretboards or synthesizer keys, the musical sensitivity is evident here, the soul, the harmony...everything for a masterpiece, a sheer lesson of musicianship brilliance, is here. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING, AMAZING and INCREDIBLY AMAZING!","review":"This CD is a must-buy CD to all progressive metal lovers, this CD shows that the proggressive music wasn't completely lost after the 70's.

This is how good musicians sound like. Individually they are not the best players out there, but when they get together they are by far the best band right now. The band plays so tight and makes all this haunting, weird, difficult and beautiful passages that each time that I listen to them, I always go WOW.Petrucci's work has influence and continues to influence technically oriented guitar players all over the world.The song writing in this album is short of genius.Their sound is in the same level as Rush, Pink Floyd or U2.This album is just a true rock classic.If you're just getting into progressive rock this is a great introduction to the genre. Please buy this album and go see their shows, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Progress","review":"I think this album was very good but the band was still looking for their refined sound.

Please.......","review":"If you are a fan of syrupy ballads by lycra clad hair bands, this is the CD for you. Compare them to the Beatles and Pink Floyd? No way -- the best album of the 90's? I sure hope not -- the intent of the album is good - the music is inspired and the lyrics thoughtful but that is lost when all of the raw power of the band is consumed by the production. What you have left is an over-dubbed over produced product that takes away all of the bands individuality and makes them sound like other generic \\"hard-rock\\" bands. Do us a favor, plug them into some amps and take away the aural exciters and let us hear them for what they really are - very talented musicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"One must put up barriers...","review":"...to protect oneself from the Portnoy's and Peart's of the world.

I mean, this band isntnot on mtv, and only good bands are on mtv. someone said that they were on mtv but that is impossible because they only play bands with good talent like good charlotte. That John Petrucci guy thinks he is so great, but have you seen the newest guitare trick that all the mtv bands r doing? the guitareist jumps up and down while playing the same note, that is so much better than playing 128th notes that lasst for like, .01 seconds. that Avril Lavigne fan who wrote a review further down is a genius. i'm sure that she is at the top of her class at junior college. I heard a dumb theater (i are so funny hahaha) fan once say that u know that Petrucci is better because he can easily play all of avrils songs but she could never play any of his guitare parts and my response to that is...uh....i have to...um...go....and uh...do something"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware you may be listening to AC/DC","review":"I purchased the Images and Words (ATCO 792148-2) CD from CDnow.I got the correct liner notes, the disc is a factory pressing, correct in every way, with 8 tracks of W&I; listed.

I'm a huge DT fan, especially their more recent stuff, but the old stuff sounds more pop/van halen/over simplified. After listening to the musical masterpiece Metropolis II, which I think is one of the best CD's I've ever heard, Metropolis I was a huge letdown. There were some recurring musical themes between the two, but the first one had down downright 'dinky' parts to it. Progressive rock has come a long way, and Dream Theater is one of the best and brightest stars on the Prog Rock venue... but that doesn't mean their old stuff is any good. Avoid this CD at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a note, not a review...","review":"I noticed that after 71 reviews, \\"Images and Words\\" had 5 stars. I am as much a DT fan as the next guy, but isn't that a little excessive? I mean, we aren't talking 'Sgt. Pepper' here. We aren't talking 'Dark Side of the Moon' Many would argue we aren't even talking 'Fragile' or 'Moving Pictures'. 'Images...' and 'Scenes...' are DT's best moments but I think 4 Stars is more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"What an utter disappointment. What the heck does this band think they are doing? They are obviously talented muso's, but really...these would have to be the worst lyrics I have ever heard. In an effort to sound intellectual, they have strung together a bunch totally unrelated phrases, which only succeeds in confusing the listener and making them wonder why they parted with thier hard earnt. Now don't get me wrong and tell me it has all gone over my head, I'm a Rush fan so I'm no stranger to heavy lyrics. Come to think of it, maybe you would be better off listening to some Rush, at least Neil Peart's lyrics make sense and take you to somewhere other than confusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The breakout album","review":"It goes without saying that this album is great. If you're a Dream Theater fan you're probably familiar with most of the songs, and you KNOW Metropolis and Pull me Under. These are very good songs, and deserve the recognition they get. However, I just read a review saying that besides Metropolis, Learning to Live, Pull me Under, and Take the Time, the album is full of filler.. (He gave the album 5 stars, i'm not trying to attack him) but that's simply not true. Under a Glass Moon remains one of my favorites, with a really cool chorus with heavy riffs and mystical keyboard in the background, and then a KILLER guitar solo by Petrucci that is one of his best. Another Day is beautiful, a nice slow song by Dream Theater, (They have plenty of great ones), and Surrounded and Wait for Sleep are both solid. I don't have When Dream and Day Unite, but I have everything else, and Dream Theater has never let me down yet. 5 Stars to the best band in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"The CD that changed my life","review":"So, maybe that's a little drastic... I was a punk before I heard this CD. I had never listened to prog rock or metal or anything heavy before, but after the first time I heard it, I found myself singing \\"Take the Time\\" in the shower. Dream Theater is one of those rare bands whose music can really move me. James LaBrie is awesome. They are all some of the best. This CD is guaranteed to get you hooked on DT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing","review":"The progressive/fusion album I would take with me on the moon, or wherever I may go. I may rate this album the most beautiful album of the last 25 years, 50 years, hundred years, I don't know. I have listened to it thousands times and never get tired of . I don't know another album I listened that much. There are days, weeks, months, periods when I can't listen to nothing else, so I put this cd on and listen to it in loop, from its beginning to its end all day long.

You don't want to end up in the situation I was in, paying $20.00 for the \\"Images And Words\\" album, and was not worth it.You've got a mixture of Metallica, and a couple of good ballads and that's it. Dream Theater seemed to step off balance with this one, ultimately due to constant screaming, and excessive instrument playing. This is just complete \\"noise\\" to me, because hearing instruments playing (quitars, bass, drums, piano) for a combined 15 minutes I suppose, is uncalled for.The only songs on here that are ok is 'Surrounded', and 'Wait For Sleep'; they seem to have some definition added to it. The rest is all boring, mostly filled with screaming, and that's what makes this cd the most irritating.Get 'A Change of Seasons': there you have more quality, and not all the agitating vocal effects and annoying instruments playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Err... this ain't prog...","review":"In trying to broaden my prog horizons beyond Yes, Genesis, and KC I decided to pick up a Dream Theater CD since I've heard that they're sort of a \\"metal/prog\\" type band. I like some metal and I like prog, so I figured that I was in for a real treat. Boy, was I wrong...Ladies and gentlemen... Dream Theater is HAIR METAL! Sure, it's well-played hair metal - but this sure ain't prog. The singer is just awful (everytime his voice appears, I hear Beavis and Butthead yelling \\"Change It! \\") - I kept waiting for him to break into \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\". And while there are some interesting instrumental bits with the guitar, bass and drums, rest assured that a really obnoxious keyboard riff will destroy any musical momentum.If you like Dokken, Poison, or Winger you probably will love this stuff; but if you're a Yes/KC/ELP fan stay far away. If you're looking for new prog, check out \\"Flower Kings,\\" \\"Transatlantic,\\" or \\"Porcupine Tree.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"more like a nightmare...","review":"i recently listened to this for the first time since the 1990s. i have remained very familiar with \\"Pull Me Under\\", but i was puzzled why i hadnt given this CD a spin in over 18 years!oh, thats why - BECAUSE IT SUCKS. wtf - rock vaudevillian music? meandering symphonies that tire and sure, are at a fierce meter and therefore difficult to play w/ perfection, but sound like absolute drivel.the cd rests in the trash bin at this moment. i actually endured the whole thing without screaming."},{"rating":"1","title":"A musician","review":"DT are a bunch of technique-blinded guys who would be the greatest band on Earth if only they knew how to write songs instead of weaving great metal riffs and stunning solos with weak,naive bits of pretentious melodies,topped with lyrics trying to be intellectual and convincing.To compare music like 'Images and words' to classic rock such as Pink Floyd or even Rush is nothing but sacrilegious.Huge arrangements and overblown production don't make up musical (not technical) incompetence"},{"rating":"1","title":"Of COURSE they're amazingly talented...","review":"...and can play the pants off almost any other band out there. That much is pretty obvious, no matter what you think of the songs.But, this sounds WAAAAAAAY too much like 1980's hair metal for my taste. And not the \\"kinda okay in a silly mood because it's at least kinda heavy and at least faux-evil\\" Motley Crue's \\"Shout at the Devil\\" or even the \\"bluesy, gritty, sleazy and dirty\\" G 'n' R's \\"Appetite\\" kind of hair metal way.... the really craptacular and loathsome Bon Jovi or Def Leppard kind of way...Musicianship is GREAT (ten star worthy on the strength of that alone), but the horrific songs, the style and tone is reminiscent of some of the worst music ever, to me (which is worth about negative 20 stars).To each their own, I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for the singer.....","review":"Thanks for the singer I rate it two stars. The guy is simply ANNOYING!!! I just can't stand his vocals.

LOOK OUR TIME CHANGES, OUR VELOCITY, LOOK, LOOK!!

At their best they rock as hard as any band on the planet.

The other tracks fall somewhere in between. Musicianship is first-rate throughout. Overall, a keeper, if you avoid the mushy spots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone hire another singer!!!!","review":"James Labrie is a very lucky guy. Owner of a utterly bad, screaming, pop metal voice, he got a job working with some of the more talented, skilled and professional musicians around: Dream Theater.Labrie's voice alone makes the rating for this album drops drastically. To say h e has an \\"operratic voice\\" must be a bad joke... If you wanna hear \\"operatic\\", then go for Michael Kiske or Bruce Dickinson. If you wanna hear a metal singer knowing how and when to scream and use falsettos, go for Rob Halford. In short, go anywhere, except for James Labrie. The best parts of this album is when he keeps his mouth shut.The music is strong and complex as always is the case for Dream Theater. No matter how good it is, it's definitely not for any taste"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely listenable","review":"I just don't see what's beyond the hype when it comes to Dream Theater. Maybe I'm just out of the loop but I just found \\"Images and Words\\" to be a tedious listen.Being a musician, I can certainly appreciate the talents of John Petrucci, Kevin Moore and John Petrucci but it the overwhelming ability of the members simply cannot compensate for the lackluster songwriting and long-winded guitar/keyboard indurance-fests. And the pseudo-intellectual lyrics didn't exactly win my adoration either.You won't hear anything substantial or mindblowing on Images and Words. What you will hear is 5 musicians trying really hard to out do eachother"},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could have put more stars, I would have!!!!","review":"This is an absolutely incredible album. I originally received my first copy of this album in the form of a tape, back in 1993, from a friend, as a birthday gift. From my first listen, I was hooked. I could not believe my ears!!!! In a decade plagued by depressing and apathetic music, Dream Theater delivers wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Prog Classic!","review":"The album that broke DT (sorta), and is considered by most to be their magnum opus. Indeed, it is one of the definitive progressive rock albums of the 90's, and one of Dream Theater's best. Awesome tracks abound include: the Shakespheare influenced Pull Me Under, the Petrucci showpiece Take The Time, and what is possibly the band's best song Metropolis Part 1, with it's incredible \\"locomotive\\" guitar/drum riff. Of course, we cannot leave out the epic closing track Learning To Live. I am of opinion that their Scenes From A Memory album is more of a thrill ride from beginning to end, but I & W sure has it's moments, and is a lock for their second best studio album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendo material!!!","review":"Nuestros panitas de Dream Theater siempre asombran con sus buenos riff y complicadas piezas.

Although the cheese factor on this type of prog metal is very high, this album is probably the least cheesy. Much less so than their more recent work. It satisfies my ears to hear one of the most technically proficient guitarists of all time mate their virtuosity with solid song writing. As a gutarist John Petrucci has had a VERY profound influence on my playing such that I had a friend tell me that I sounded like a clone of him the first time she heard me play last year. I fear some non-musicians might non get this album. If you are a budding guitarist, You need this album. The cover of the album looks like a master work of art, the music is such too, not too esoteric for non-metalheads to listen too either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Theater newbie!","review":"So glad I took the advice of all the devoted DT fans who recommended this cd.

Don't really know which one yet, but after listening to the 30 second sound bytes here, I will probably buy Images and Words first (I love \\"\\"Pull me Under\\"). After that, I will go by what you avid DT fans have to recommend to me. Being a die-hard Rush fan, I do appreciate hard-core musicianship and songs that actually have some meaning and melody (apart from hip-hop and rap-crap). Damn, if just a few younger kids would listen to this, they would become hooked! I am definitely hooked on becoming a DT fan.

He struggles with reading, spelling, and writing. Having this talking dictionary has given him a new sense of independence when completing his homework. If he doesn't know what a particular word is, he types it in to find out how to pronounce it and what the definition is. If he isn't sure how to spell a particular word or just wants to make sure he has it correct, he types it in and is either given a thumbs up or suggestions on what word he might be trying to spell. We put in his 25 spelling words this past week and played jumble, guess the word, and hangman. The games seemed to duplicate some of the words and not get to some others, but that is only a minor complaint. My 7 year old daughter is also enjoying this product.

He deserved every ounce of his two - yes two - Oscars that he received for this role. He is amazing to watch. Though disabled, it was hard to consider him handicapped. I once used this film in my sunday school class. The lesson was on overcoming adversity and I showed the scene where Russell plays a piano duet with Hoagy Carmichael. The girls in my class were amazed. Then I shared with them some of the other things Russell had accomplished in his life - like being a founder of AMVETS. Russell's off screen story is a story in itself and should be made into a movie. Unfortunately, no actor could convincingly play him.

Listen, for example, as to how the composer treats several disperate scenes with his bittersweet 'Americana'-imbued score [influences of Copland (naturally), Gershwin, and the second-movement of Elliott Carter's First Symphony (1942), the latter of which was known to Friedhofer].If this great score does not move you, then absolutely nothing will.

So for decades, I hoped that I would run across the film on TV and reconnect--even though by that time I only vaguely remembered it as a good story about a soldier with no hands. Then one Sunday morning in the early 1980's, I turned on HBO just as the title hit the screen. A few minutes into the film Harold Russell pulled his hand-hooks out of his pockets to sign a military form, and I screamed to my wife, \\"It's that movie!\\" I felt like I had won the lottery.

(meaning fatal error happen much more often). Transfer speed is much slower. How long do you wish to wait between shots? The slower the memory card, the longer the wait.

It seems to more decorative anyway as it is not made for warmth. Within a few months the strings started unraveling and I was afraid to even touch it to fix it because everytime I did, it would unravel more. I threw it away. If you want to hang this on a wall, it may work. But not made for a bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It hasn't left my CD player in a month!","review":"I was given this CD as a gift in a set with bath stuff, and I love listening to it. It's definitely relaxing, but also energizing, and I just keep it on while cleaning up the house, or even sometimes when falling asleep. It's purely instrumental, with piano, chimes, and nice melodies. Also, there is some ocean sound and gulls unobtrusively here and there. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Introduction to Metal Casting","review":"I bought the paper version of this book about 15 years ago and followingthe instructions in it built a home foundry for minimal cost.

The projects you would build will cost from zero to however much you want, depending on your scavenging skills and determination. For instance I brought home a few goodies from the land fill : ) Keep your eyes pealed and instead of doing this project in a few weeks, make it a few years, and you'll save money and enjoy a new hobby.

No prior experience in any form of metalworking or handicrafts is required, although some carpentry experience is rather useful. I am a full-time welding and machining student, and this(and Dave's other books in this series), are literally a dream come true.If you enjoy tinkering with stuff, and dream about being a machinist/foundryman/all-around do-it-yourselfer, then you owe it to yourself to get this book, and the others in the series.Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a gem in the rough","review":"An amazing testament to one man's creativity and hard work, and an inspiration to other budding machinists and tinkerers.

Clearly you need to be able to build a milling machine, and to build that you need a lathe, and to build that you need a foundry. This book shows how to build the foundry, and the books that follow show how to build the lathe, milling machine, etc. I didn't actually end up building a foundry, but it is now on my list.

The handle is not a solid piece and is open on the bottom so it digs into your hand if you pick the vacuum up. Also, the clasps that attach the top portion (vacuum motor) to the bottom come unsnapped very easily and I've had dust and debris fly in my face on several occasions carting this unit around.

The first project was to prepare my garage floor for painting.They call it \\"Ultra Quiet.\\" That may be a reach but it sure is better than my last shop-vac which sounded more like a shuttle launch.The blower function works very well except that, even tho it has threaded on hose ends to keep it in place, during blowing the hose separated from the end fitting on several occasions.

I need to hold it in one hand and move it with the other.It you are only going to listen to this radio for the few minutes each morning when you're alarm goes off then I'm sure its fine for that but if you plan on having it on for any length of time - spend a bit more and get somethig that sounds better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"I bought this a long time ago, and to this day I still remember what a crappy clock it was.

There is so much static you can't hear the radio station, that takes 45 minutes to fine-tune in.

Another hard earned money down the drain. I was better off going to the thrift store. Needless to say, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kallmaker keeps on ticking...","review":"I have read and enjoyed many of Karin Kallmaker's books and \\"Substitute for Love\\" is among her best. Holly has a mentally abusive aunt who has hidden her past, a clueless boyfriend who takes advantage of her in many ways, and new friends that open her up to a whole new world. Reyna has a bigoted father who uses her mother's illness to blackmail her into submission.I liked the overall story and give it 5 stars. However, Holly's newfound sexuality and immediate love connection with Reyna seem a little far fetched. If you can accept that we read fiction to escape the real world and see the (almost) impossible happen, you'll enjoy this book immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite overrated","review":"I am a fan of most of Kallmaker's earlier work, but it seems like her more recent books are getting thicker and thicker... with details I don't really care for. I think it's great that the author is doing her homework and researching the careers that she is writing about, but I really don't think that the majority of the book should be about it! To give you an idea of how much of this extra boring detail there is, the two main characters don't even meet until halfway into the book! I like a story where the focus is on the two main characters, their feelings and reactions to each other. There is very little of that here and I was rather disappointed. If I went through the book fast it was because I was speeding through the mundane day-to-day anguish that both characters are going through. I enjoy character interaction, not prolonged pain and suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"If you like your lesbo romances served up unbelievable, dip into this one... you won't be disappointed. Why must all the male characters be jerks? It's already a given we're predisposed to liking women... but must the men be so awful, too? Can't we love women without hating men? And Kallmaker takes me right out of the story by writing the \\"Gypsy\\" Kings, instead of Gipsy (not just once, but at least three times). This story felt like it was written with a 1950s sensibility. Must we accept such bad writing? If this is the best there is and she's the undisputed queen, our literature is in trouble. For a mainstream novel, try \\"The Corrections,\\" which has a beautifully rendered lesbian romance that is wholly satisfying (given that the characters don't end up together--something that actually happens in real life).And Naiad, those covers! Really, you diminish the value of your list by putting such terrible covers on your books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I've read Kallmaker before and this is one of her best. The love story was believable. The way the characters discover themselves in each other seems magical. Kallmaker touches on two important lesbian issues - coming out and being accepted.

If you are sane, beyond the mature age of 12 or both you will most likely become very nauseous very quickly. After booting up the CD you'll be quickly drowned in bible transcripts of all sorts.

I can honestly tell you this~~ after reading this book, we have been medication FREE for 1 week. Not impressive to some, but to those who can relate, it's a huge milestone. I could not have done this without the help of this book. Many, many thanks to the author, Nancy Thomas.

My psychiatrist recommended this book to my parents. I did not get proper therapy for this condition, but my parents instead, used this book as a guide. This woman IS NOT a professional, and her tactics for handing children with RAD, are basically re traumatize, and re abuse the children. I have read the book myself, and personally would love to sue the author! Her writings lead to me being locked in a room with an alarm on the door, I had to ask to use the bathroom, I was only allowed to eat and drink with permission.

Her \\"expertise\\" in the area of attachment is entirely the result of shameless self promotion. Her \\"techniques\\" are not based on science or psychology. She has a \\"cult\\" following, but no long term studies to determine whether her form of discipline is actually helpful or harmful. In many cases, she is the justification for child abuse by parents who prefer to blame the child rather than examine the problems.Where is the psychological study supporting her views? Where are her educational credentials? Her basis for making psychological judgments?Attachment is a hot button issue right now, and Nancy Thomas has taken advantage of this trend to make herself a self described \\"expert\\" in the field.

I view the characters in this show much differently than those in The Wire or The Sopranos. The characters in Intelligence are, in a way, ordinary people. Especially if compared to those shows. They aren't kids on the streets of baltimore slinging crack. They aren't muscle heads in Jersey who no nothing but a life of crime. They do strive to be those things though. I definitely mean no offense by this statement but, these are a bunch a white guys who deal pot in Canada. Not to say that this isn't dangerous or worth having a show about. The show is handled brilliantly. You always get the sense though, that a lot of this is just a facade. They're barely getting by with walking the walk. I found that one of the most intriguing things about it. Also, it's just a very well put together show, with believable characters and an overall great story arc.

Start doing stuff, I want to see you do stuff,\\" and he never seemed to do stuff.If you're an avid fan of gnomes, check out this movie but be ready to fast forward a lot 'cause there is so much troll non-action that will bore you to tears.If you're a fan of trolls, I just want to know why? What does a troll even do? I don't get it. I mean, come on, get real. These trolls were a joke and almost ruined the film. I gave it a two star review because these trolls were dumb.

The book is written in rhyme but the rhymes are too advanced for it's target audience (Kindergarten, 1st grade).

They have long taught Columbia's MBAs and executive programs so it is not surprise that they have brought it so readably together in this single volume. Like any other comprehensive textbook it is too long to read straight through. I intended mostly to skim but also dive into selected passages but found myself hooked and glad of it. I particularly liked its modern, forward looking attitude.This is absolutely not the 4Ps dressed up with some e-business. Capon and Hulbert revisit the fundamentals of what marketing will be and each chapter has a neat table comparing \\"new way\\" with \\"old way\\". It is also packed with real examples and their website addresses.

Sally Bedell Smith did a wonderful job researching and writing about one of America's greatest fascinations - the Kennedy family. There have been countless numbers of articles, essays and books written about the Kennedys, most of which discuss the family from a political point of view from the outside looking in. What Sally Bedell Smith does masterfully and uniquely is discuss the private world of the Kennedys and their closest friends from the inside looking out. Reading the book, I felt like I was a fly on the wall for the entire time the Kennedys lived at the White House. I got to share in the excitement, the ambition, the sorrow and the wantoness of the Kennedys and their friends.

This one is no different from the many others that have been published in the last three or four years. It tells us stuff we aready know and flips it. It states that some information printed in the past praises the Kennedy's too much or too little. It is true that too many books seem to either portay the couple as extreemly sad and unattached to one another or in love w/ minor problems.This book seeks to show a complet picture, which it does. It's just that it says nothing new, nothing making it worthy of purchasing. I recommend that you download the audio version b/c it's cheaper and much more pleasent way to read this book.Instead of this book buy \\"America's Queen\\", \\"Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life,\\", and \\"Mrs Kennedy: The Missing History of the Kennedy Years:"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Society","review":"If you want to know who comes from old money and who from new, this is your book.

INTERESTING PREMISE, BOGGED BY MONOTONY","review":"Google lists nearly 200 films about Adolf Hitler, most of them documentaries such as Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will and Fuhrer: Rise of a Madman.The Architecture of Doom was perhaps the first to propose the notion that Hitler embraced the art of politics after failing as a painter, suggesting that Nazism was a reflection of the dictator's perverse aesthetic tastes. In its deconstruction of the Nazi movement, the movie is novel and shows an interesting, perhaps true, perspective.But what minor grouse I have is with the narrative, which is just shy of 2 hours or so and sports a frequent monotone of showing Nazi art. Yet, thankfully, it doesn't detract substantially from the intriguing perspective that Hitler's whole pet project was perhaps more of a dogged pursuit of an aesthetic.This documentary is definitely worth a watch if you are interested in the Third Reich in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drink lots of coffee before watching this.","review":"I am a student of third reich history and when I heard of the release of this film I managed to see it at an independent theatre.

This is the really funny stuff, before Carlin hit his comic skids. I used to be Irish Catholic, Seven Words you Can't Say, ... the classic bits that are a lot more pleasant and MUCH more condusive to repeat listening than the current stuff (which is important if you're buying it!). Sure his 90s stuff is funny, but not as funny. And the 90s stuff is certainly more angry and grating. It is for this reason that there actually seems to be 'two Carlins.' The current one, and the classic one. Like most great performers, Carlin was fresher, more genuine, and more energetic in his early years. Some of these Classic Gold bits haven't aged well, such as the Radio/TV parodies. But most of it is truly timeless. No true Carlin fan should be without this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-stop laughs","review":"Creative, innovative, hilarious, and downright imaginitive. I couldn't stop laughing.

Even though the topics he discusses are still valid, his style and delivery back then was just too wordy and slow for today.

The quick connect appealed to me because with the decking, I needed to change between drilling and screwing repeatedly. The quick connect system was great for this.However, the smaller drill bits all broke after about 30 holes drilled. The quick connect at the base of the smaller drill bits makes them pretty weak and the drill bit sits quite a ways out from the drill chuck because of the quick connect set which puts them under extra tension. And both the P2 drill bits broke after about 50 screws each. They just sheered off at the top.Now I realise that doing decking is a pretty intense job (I drilled and screwed about 2000 holes) and I shouldn't have gone for a cheap set.

The problem is that the lights are too close together to keep your orientation. If they were spread apart on the wings it might be a different story.I think the fact is that night flying is very hard and really should only be attempted by an expert.

Naturally, I would have liked to have seen at least one Native American and Latina included. Perhaps the author will write a sequel. Within those limitations though, its a good and useful book.

It's too high pitched and she is basically \\"cooing\\" her way through each and every song. She has no range to her voice what so ever. There is not one song where she belts on (I don't think she can).The music, production and beats on these songs gets so repetitive that you have to stop it midway through the CD (if you make it that far). They all have the same beat as \\"Me & U\\" but they all tend to seem a bit casio-keyboard-ish...hence, almost to the point of sounding generic.I really gave this CD a chance and WANTED to like it but, I can't. I would save your money for one of the MANY CD's that are about to drop in the months to come!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HATERS!! keep hating, maybe that'll get her to stop singing.","review":"Please Cassie, LISTEN 2 THE HATERS!!Cassie cant even be classed as a mediocre singer, she has a limited vocal range, weak support and basically cant carry a tune to save her life.This album is not quality music, well maybe with a capable vocalist it may be better.It's hard to believe that someone would be dumb enough to give this woman a record deal.Her live performances are even worse than her cd, she can't lip sync, she can't sing, she cant dance......she really should be embarrassed.Overall, cassie's voice is under developed, her dancing is amateur and is an all-round pathetic performer.This album is not worth a cent and if someone gave it to me as a gift I'd cry.Instead of buying this rubbish, consider something that doesn't make your ears bleed.-Sarah C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God for Ryan Leslie","review":"I usually like to support new artists by buying their CD's but with this purchase of Cassie's album I feel guilty that I've contributed to her album sales. As a male, I do think she is very attractive and that may be why I was so ready to get her album but she should have took the modeling, dancing, or acting route because Cassie has no vocal ability at all. I think that even Ciara has an edge on her a little bit. Just a little bit. I will admit that the production is hot. Thank God for Ryan Leslie who saved this album with the production. I find myself forgetting that Cassie is even singing because I am so into the beats and the production that I have to remind myself that this is Cassie's album and not a mixtape.

I heard her album online and I will not buy it, I refuse to pay for something I could have done myself on my computer. Cassie's got the looks but not the voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Say Much For It","review":"I'm afraid this is a pretty weak excuse for an album. Yes, there are catchy songs - obviously, the singles \\"Me & U\\" and \\"Long Way 2 Go\\" are great, but besides those, I can't say much for the album.Some of the songs are okay, like \\"Miss Your Touch\\" with its catchy, danceable beat and tune, and \\"About Time\\" which actually seems to make sense, as opposed to the other songs. Having her and others rap in the songs is really just cheesy to me. Some of the things they say are just plain stupid and annoying. I expect a lot better.The worst part, however, is Cassie's voice. It's extremely weak, and she has a very limited vocal range. I can't remember which song it was, but I was cringing as she worked her way up to a higher note. I'm sure without all of the background vocals/music and studio add-ins, she could not hit that note at all.So, I really wouldn't recommend this unless you're willing to spend your money on a CD that has really only 4/11 good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd recommend something else","review":"As soon as I heard Me & U I knew Cassie would be huge. It's a great song and very catchy and a very summery tune. However, when I listened to the album, there were only two other songs I liked: Ditto is great and probably the best song on the album. It's even catchier than Me & U. I also like Long Way 2 Go, the second single from the album. In conclusion, the beats on this CD cover Cassie's somewhat weak vocals. I'd download the singles off iTunes, or buy something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cassie Not going to well","review":"well, I cant say i dont like too many albums but this is not a strong start for cassie. I expected it to be bangin' and all i got was a woman who sounded like a litte girl, I was very dissapointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I like this album. It is fun, sexy and laced with slinky beats. Cassie's voice is extremely limited, however the songs highlight the little she has to work with. Much of the record is her talking through each song. When she makes attempts to sing, she usually is flat or clearly straining. I could see this album really taking off in the clubs.The songs I like are \\"Me & U\\", \\"Long Way 2 Go\\", \\"About Time\\", and \\"Just One Night.\\" If you like her, Target is selling a promo version featuring a DVD with the making of the video \\"Me & U\\" and some clips of her making the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has a pretty voice!","review":"Cassie's cd was ok, it wasn't what I expected it to be.

I think she has some good beats. I like the album overall. If you buy this album expecting her to be singing like ALicia Keys or something, then forget it!! Otherwise, if you can appreciate good beats to groove to...then you'll probably like the CD. I do agree with others that she needs to stop dancing, but she's alright musically for now. I think she sounds better than Ashanti.

From the start I knew that Cassie didn't have the best voice, but the great production of the music took my focus off of her voice, and put it more on the music. Buying the album is a waste of money, and listening to it is a waste of time. The only songs I like are \\"Me and U,\\" \\"Long Way 2 Go,\\" and \\"Ditto.\\" The other songs have good production, but Cassie's weak vocals ruin the effect of them. You'd be better off downloading the songs off the internet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rather listen to a pack of howling dogs","review":"Cassie is a real cutie no doubt but she can't sing period. I've heard crying infants that sound better than this young lady. The album has some decent music but the vocals that are laid over the music are atrocious! Cassie's voice makes me cringe similar to listening to someone scratch a chalkboard. I would never buy this album. I like the way cassie looks so instead of buying her album I will download a picture instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"Honestly, I really wasn't impressed with this album. The first four songs really caught my attention but the remaining seven didn't impress me at all. I wasn't really thrilled about the first single at first, but it grew on me after a while. There are some great beats overall but the lyrics and vocal production could have been a whole lot better. Cassie is a beautiful girl but she needs to release something creative and unique or else she will get lost in the shuffle."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the effort.","review":"This cd is awful, the music is nice but her voice is awful. She is going on the list of other beautiful women who can't hold note to save their lives....but still make money trying. If you saw the BET performance (woud you call it that). Then you already know what to expect. My friend bought this cd and can't even give it away! So that should tell you something. What happened to real singing and NOT studio MADE Garbage??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Lazy R&B/Pop Album","review":"Nothing against Cassie but R&B is supposed to have a little passion if that is what she is trying to pull off with this album. All of the songs are sung with very little emotion and they aren't really that good. Cassie is another Bad Boy pop project who will fill the void for 12 year olds everywhere but true R&B fans would rather listen to Keyshia or Alicia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad voice","review":"Her voice is bad, I heard her cd because my friend has it and she talks her way through every single song. It just goes to show you, you can have a pretty face and no voice and still be able to come out with a cd. I feel sorry for people who can actually sing and there not able to get a chance to go far. I could have sung that song Me & U and I seen her performance on Bet and I couldnt believe how horrible her voice was and she had the nerve to have back up singers to help her with the song."},{"rating":"1","title":"The girl cant sing .Case closed.","review":"Cassie is a beautiful young girl who used to model and been discovered by Mottola and been taken under Diddy wings.This cd has good beats and thats all i can say cuz thats all Im hearing .Her voice is very weak and low ,sounds as she s whispering and she absolutely cannot perform live.This is Not Quality Music.I would not reccomend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Pure studio work.

From day one it's had trouble printing out a confirmation sheet. Fortunately I only use it to do an occassional fax but I have to guess that whatever I sent made it to where it's supposed to go. It always complains there's a jam when there is no jam and the printing feature always tries to suck in too much paper gets mad at me. Thankfully, the main fax scanner works like it should otherwise I'd have put this in the garbage eons ago. Another minor annoyance is that the phone doesn't sit snuggly enough in the cradle. Just blow on it and it falls right off. I'm here today looking for another machine since I will need to fax alot more often now and I don't want to rely on faulty equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!","review":"This fax machine is not worth buying.

Now this machine only lasted a week before it started doing the same thing, and the local dealer says that it is not worth fixing.I know that I am not paying a lot of money for the machine, but it should last more than a week.I still have 6 of the 301 cartridge so I think I will try one more machine.Wish me luck!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phone & fax service.","review":"Using plain paper is a big benefit. Low cost is a plus. Phone & fax on same line works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNKER","review":"I would take pleasure in smashing this piece of junk to bits. The machine is tempermental. It hangs up regarding the bulk paper input stack; it frequently refuses the paper I wish to fax or copy; its scanner resolution is very poor; its output quality is terrible; it has much difficulty in scanning documents that have a background image, and it wastes an enormous amount of that expensive carbon paper that it uses as ink source; and it is S-L-O-W in every respect. The fact that it is named with a derivative of the name 'Intelligent' is an insult, and I don't intend to ever purchase anything else made by BROTHER again. Get another brand machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk...Junk...JUNK!!!","review":"I am on my second Brother Intellifax 775. The first one I threw out because of paper jamming problems and I'm ready to throw the current one away for the SAME reason as well. They work fine for approximately 6 months and then you get paper jams with EVERY incoming fax to the point of not being able to retrieve a fax and loosing all information that was sent to you. The roller stops feeding the paper through. I cleaned every single part I could get at and it has not helped. Also, my fax recipients tell me that my faxes have lines running through them to the point of sometimes not being able to read what I've sent. I don't do a lot of faxing so it's not due to extreme use. The price is cheap...the performance--cheaper. STAY AWAY from this model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"communication error","review":"This machine needs improving.

I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The only songs I sorta like on this album are Destiny, Rose Garden, Greta, and Kick It. The rest absolutely suck. I trashed this album after a few listens and was soooo depressed after I heard it because I knew she had lost her touch. Do not listen to her devout following. This album SUCKS! Greta should have been her first and only single from this album and even it is a ripoff of Bette Davis Eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I can't believe that most Stevie fans hated or greatly disliked this album! I think it's one of her bests! This, Bella Donna, and The Other Side of the Mirror. Lyrically speaking, this is her best work. I think that \\"STREET ANGEL\\" is haunting, too! But my favorite song on this album is \\"LISTEN TO THE RAIN\\"...She rocked on..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Angel","review":"After leaving the band \\"Fleetwood Mac\\" in 1993 Stevie devoted time to a new record which would be her first album of all new material since 1989's \\"The Other Side Of The Mirror\\". While the album has three great songs, the rest of the material is pretty dull. Since that 1989 album nothing has changed much. Stevie is still not content with writing all of her songs anymore. She has relegated herself to writing with other people and in this case recording songs written by other people. Bob Dylan (?) contributes a decent offering \\"Just Like A Woman, but the album is further evidence that Stevie may be losing her touch. Stevie shines best on the album's singles \\"Blue Denim\\" and \\"Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind\\" as well another non-single titled \\"Kick It\\". The album is not a complete waste, but it is a major step back for Stevie Nicks. Best song on the album : Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Disaster But....","review":"Stevie Nicks' only release of new material in the 1990's is a strangely dull, emotionless collection of songs that range from decent to despicible. Oddly, for a woman who has exhibited so passion in her songs, \\"Street Angel\\" sounds unfinished and tentative. Even when her material has not been first-rate, Stevie's soulful voice can make even the most questionable song sound heartfelt, but on this CD, Stevie sounds as if she does'nt care anymore. Part of the blame goes to Klonopin, a tranquilizer that Stevie admitted \\"destroyed my creativity\\" and the revolving door of Producers. Only on \\"Rose Garden\\" and \\"Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind\\" does Stevie show any glimmer of the great singer she was in the 1970's and (somewhat) in the 1980's. Thankfully, she remerged in 2001 with the excellent \\"Trouble in Shangri-La\\" CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Street Angel","review":"Street Angel being Nick's 1994 release and her 5th studio album and peaked at #16 in the UK album chart and #41 in the US album chart. I think it is a very good album and I particularly like tracks such as \\"Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind\\", and her cover of Dylan's \\"Just Like a Woman\\", which features Dylan himself on harmonica. The cover is really nice and the booklet is quite informative with all the lyrics and a list of whom plays what on each track. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OK effort - but below Stevie's standards","review":"Despite the fact that this album has not sold very well (it just went Gold in 1997) and the nasty comments by Critics, \\"Street Angel\\" is not bad, just boring. \\"Blue Denim\\" is the best song, the title track is not bad, and the duo of \\"Rose Garden\\" and \\"Maybe Love will Change your Mind\\" work well too. But the surrounding material is lifeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of her strongest material in years","review":"Although this may be Stevie's weakest studio album as far as the production goes, it DOES contain some of the strongest and best written material she has produced in years. The album overall is superior to 1989's \\"The Other Side of the Mirror.\\" If you aren't sure whether you should purchase this album or not, I have two words for you - \\"Blue Denim.\\" Why this song wasn't a HUGE hit is beyond me. Most certainly a Stevie Nicks classic. Other stand out cuts include \\"Love is Like a River\\", Bob Dylan's \\"Just Like a Woman\\", \\"Maybe Love (will change your mind)\\", \\"Kick It\\", \\"Rose Garden\\" and \\"Destiny\\". Actually, if you are going to purchase this album, do yourself a favor...shell out the few extra bucks and buy the Japanese IMPORT with the extra tracks \\"God's Garden\\" and \\"Inspiration\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad cd by a good singer","review":"This album is a real disappointment! \\"Docklands\\" is about doing laundry, \\"Street Angel\\" romanticizes the plight of the homeless, and \\"Jane\\" is a painful ode to Jane Goodall, a woman renowned for her work with chimpanzees, but deserving of a better tribute than this song. Die-hard fans alone should buy this album, but for the casual listener or fan, check out any Stevie Nicks album but this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average","review":"Stevie Nicks of the nineties isn\`t much to write home about. Her 70\`s and eightees releases are in general top rate and totally in their own league! Honest Stevie Nicks diehards should not kid themselves. We love the woman, but this album and her other 90\`s involvments are a pale forgery of the brand we love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly Good Songs but A Different Sound","review":"From what I understand Stevie was not all too happy with this album and I can see why. Seems like the producers wanted to bring her more \\"down to earth\\" rather than let her \\"take to the skies\\". This is not a bad effort in my opinion though. There are some good moments like the butt kicking \\"Love is Like a River\\" or the more dreamy \\"Greta\\" and \\"Rose Garden\\". I also like the title track \\"Street Angel\\" just because it has a strange feel. Stevie's voice has lost some range and flexibility from years of abuse (I mean vocally), but all the feeling and passion are still there. Her cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Just Like a Woman\\", sounds too much like she is trying to imitate his choppy singing. I also cringed at the line \\"the forgotten chimpanzee\\" in the song \\"Jane\\", in which she uses a bizarre vocal effect. Besides these two songs, the rest of the album is pretty good even if the overall sound is different from her other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"i tried soooo hard......","review":"Miss Stevie Nicks is my absolute favorite singer/songwriter of all time. I got this cd about a year ago and based on extremely mixed reviews i decided to give this a chance and not be influenced by the other reviews good or bad. That being said this cd is awful. i will always love Blue Denim but this cd has a generic jazzy/soft contemporary rock feel of the mid 90's. Its a shame because production killed this cd but ill admit some of the lyrics are pretty good. Destiny in particular since it has the same first verse as the timeless song \\"Enchanted\\" I adore anything that Stevie is involved in but this doesnt really even seem like it is her music, no wonder she didnt promote it and pretends now like it never happened, if she would have been able to be around for the producing of this album it could have been great, no fault to Stevie tho it fell into the wrong, greedy hands of someone trying to make money off her when she was getting her life on track! LOVE U STEVIE"},{"rating":"1","title":"A revolving door of producers","review":"Street Angel finds Stevie Nicks at her most lost, most confused period of her solo career. By far her weakest album, this one is for the true die-hards. It was especially hard for longtime fans considering her previous effort also was not up to par. Despite the fantastic title track with David Crosby on harmony vocals along with a few others produced my Heartbreaker Mike Campbell, this album is medicore. Surprising, considering Nicks is capable of greatness when she wants it. The packaging is sloppy and low-budget, and the songs are generally weak. Very disappointing although when this was released in 1994, her singing hadn't sounded this good in ages. It is no wonder that the Fleetwood Mac reunion was Nicks's next project."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of artist","review":"i know a lot of critics liked this cd,but honestly i thought it was a lazy effort.tired old songs,stevie had been writing over the years.when i bought this i was hoping for great songs such as blue denim,but the album just falls apart as you listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Street Angel","review":"This is the worst Stevie Nicks album ever. I love Stevie so much I thought that I would like anything she did. I was wrong. I think this album is Stevie without the magic. The songs are just rock songs.

Thank god her other music is so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This is by far Stevie's best album since 1983's the Wild Heart. After two weak, uninspired releases, Stevie has found her voice again.

I've been a loyal fan for almost twenty years, and it's been way too long since Street Angel. I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Stevie...","review":"Despite not being her best effort, Street Angel is still a sweet piece of work. The title track haunts me, like any good Stevie song. Blue Denim rocks and Jane is a touching tribute. When listening to this disc, I can't help but feel that despite the \\"differentness\\" that surrounds most of the music, there was something healing in the songs. This disc is a must for any true fan of Stevie Nicks, but it's probably too lackluster for an average person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitly her weakest album","review":"Some of these songs are as tired as Stevie said she was at the time. The majority of the album is very weak with a few exceptions of \\"Blue Denim\\", \\"Destiny\\" and \\"Kick It\\" (my favorite track off the album). I'm glad Stevie has re-improved herself since. \\"Sweet Girl\\" and \\"If You Ever Did Believe\\" are indications that her next album will be MUCH better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Stevie Nicks says she hates this album!","review":"I love Stevie Nicks, so writing a negative review of one of her albums is hard, but the truth is, this is a HORRIBLE record. Docklands, Street Angel, Jane, there are so many bad songs on this disc that they make the few (and I do mean FEW) highlights seem like masterpieces! Blue Denim and Maybe Love Will Change Your Mind would be considered decent filler for any other Stevie Nicks album, but on this disc, they sound like classics. Even Stevie has said many times in many interviews that this is her least favorite record, and she doesn't sing any of these songs live anymore. If you're thinking of buying a Stevie Nicks album, buy ANYTHING else by her first. I really think that if this was the first Stevie Nicks album they'd ever bought, they would never buy another album by her again.

I now use this to store dry ingredients in my cupboard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"I'm an avid reader that was excited to read a long put-off classic of literature. While I appreciated Cervantes's use of language and his palpable desire to entertain his reader, I failed to find the story or the characters engaging, and at all times was mindful of them as tools of an author trying to be clever. Really, I am surprised myself, as I was looking forward to reading this novel. Perhaps I failed to find him funny because I was reared on comedy that was derivative of him (some might say). Either way, I give it 4 stars because his use of language is a great thing for any lover of writing to witness, even if they can't relish it, and this edition is certainly well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"DQ, actually a pretty good book.","review":"I had to read this book for a writing class this semester (Narrative and Technology), and I found it to be surprisingly good. It was a little hard to read due to the translation from Spanish to English (lots of footnotes to clarify), but otherwise was a fun book to read. Mind you, I wouldn't go out and choose to read this book on my own, but I am glad that I read it. Overall, I noticed that during the discussion of the readings from this book in class really helped to shed some light on the underlying themes and intentions of this book. Cervantes was a pretty witty guy, and you have to realize that while you're reading that this was written in the 1500's in Spain during the Inquisition. I would say, if you're reading this one on your own, to pick up a copy of Sparknotes to help you along the way. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic?","review":"I don't get it. The book seems to meander and go off on crazy tangents to no purpose. And yet, there must be a lot I am missing. I have read that many famous people have kept a copy of this book with them all their lives. For example, I read that Prez John Adams always had a copy with him. And the Spanish PM always has a copy. I have tried reading it in spanish and it is no better than the English so it couldn't be a translation problem.I would like to see a synopsis of perhaps the subliminal messages I am missing. Something must be there but what?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delusion and cowardice: A knightly disaster","review":"Read about the incompetent (and likely incontinent) knight and his cowardly squire. The two make a great duo, the knight seeing nothing to fear and foes to be vanquished everywhere, the squire afraid of everything and worrying always for his beloved donkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another classic out of the way","review":"Not every reader can appreciate every great classic of world literature. Although I enjoyed the work, I couldn't take more than twenty or thirty pages a day. I needed other kinds of reading in between. The translation is clear and readable except for one annoying thing. In Spanish, the word \\"como\\" may mean \\"like\\" or \\"as.\\" It's the translator's job to choose the English meaning appropriate for the context, and Grossman consistently chose \\"like\\" when she should have chosen \\"as.\\" For those who still care about the distinction, this quirk grates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cervantes cruel and brilliant","review":"At last found time over Christmas to take the journey with Don Q and his long suffering friend. How wickedly cruel is the humour, how merciless the assault on affectation and vanity. The translation by Grossman and Bloom is excellent. This fable is so timeless, and the writing style so knowing yet naive, I simply can't think of a better tome for the bedside."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gift!","review":"A wonderful novel, a great translation, and a superb reading by George Guidall, who beautifully captures the story's humor and pathos. If you've never read Don Quixote but are curious about why it is so highly respected , or if you've read it before and want to experience it in a new way, treat yourself to this newly translated and unabridged recording. It's 40 hours long, and if you're like me, you will hate to see it end. Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are truly unforgettable characters. Cervantes has given us the ultimate \\"buddy movie\\" plot, with adventures, disillusionment, growth, irony, and plenty of witty and compassionate commentary about the plight of humanity. Truly one of the world's great novels, and you'll probably never find a more pleasant way to experience it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Heaven and Dulcinea","review":"I must commend Grossman on her excellent translation of Cervantes classic, \\"Don Quixote\\". By far, her work is superior to other renditions of this novel including Starkie's because the literature flows better and her words/translation only adds to the story instead of cluttering the pages with small unimportant details.If your going to read one of the greatest novels ever written, read the Grossman translation and you will enjoy it much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Translation, So I'm Told","review":"I am always slightly uncomfortable when it comes to translated texts.

The plot seemed to move along nicely and there weren't too many dull moments. At times, Miguel de Cervantes would detail certain events a little bit too much and they got a bit lengthy, but the book itself was great. Each quest that Don Quixote embarks on is origional and entertaining, and Sancho, his trusty sidekick, is there to fish Don Quixote out of any predicament he may have gotten himself into. This book is for those with a good imagination and sense of humor. I highly reccommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildewed Don Quixote","review":"The book looks lovely and new but it was stored prior to shipping in a humid environment and smells strongly of mildew.

Boring beyond belief.It is also mundane, vapid and worthless.Read Hemingway or Faulkner. Read Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.Even the \\"comic section\\" of your local rag is better than this work of literaly trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction's Disappointing","review":"Don Quixote's an incredible tale and the translation is good. However, Bloom's introduction does no service to this edition. I'd hoped for a literary host to open up the tale to me in new ways, and frankly expected such from Bloom. Alas, it's an obfuscation rather than an introduction. If you're needing a quality introduction look elsewhere. If you don't need one, then Grossman's translation will delight you well enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Don Quixote, despite being 400 years old, reads as if it had been written today. Societal insight and wisdom are timeless and this books delivers both in heaping doses. So central to modern life are this book's themes, that phrases like \\"tilting at windmills\\" and \\"Quixotic\\" hold a place in our consciousness even today.That said, I believe this book can be appreciated as excerpts for those who might otherwise be intimidated by its length. The story is told as a series of tales, each of which is a minature version of the whole, so that a reading of three or four episodes would give the reader a reasonable feel for a work that is otherwise a very serious investment of time and effort.A classic that holds all of its relevance today. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Matchless Reading Experience","review":"Two friends, both retired English teachers, and I have just completed the wonderful experience of reading Don Quixote. We met every other week, reading and discussing about 100 pages at a time. This was a labor of love --each of us found Don Quixote to be fabulously interesting and provocative. The stories read so effortlessly, and the characters of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are so compelling, that we all felt great sadness at the conclusion of the work. The translation was brilliantly readable -- funny, heart-breaking at times, always accessible and engaging. For me, it has been one of the great reading experiences I have ever had. Thank you Ms. Grossman, and of course, thank you to Cervantes and his brilliant creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"limited","review":"This is a small pocket guide that does not explain very much and basically includes mostly his steps as written in his other books.These steps are not very detailed, and some of his other books include a more detailed approach.I would recommend buying Victory over the Darkness which teaches the truths needed to learn before you go through this."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL","review":"This is the best I have read on Spiritual Freedom.

It's different to this simple gangsta rap that steady repeats itself. KAM 's lyrics make you think about the world we all live in.

Touching on different topics such as racism on down to general life in the \\"hood\\". What is really dope about the album is not only the way the lyrics are delivered but the way intelligence is conveyed to the masses. There aren't any mind numbing, ignorant rhymes written just to make a quick buck. I wish we could get back to those days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for aspiring authors","review":"I found this to be a very valuable book; almost every page ended up with some highlighting. The book is a short easy read but packed with good information. Kress really breaks it down in terms of what makes a good beginning, how to keep the middle from sagging, and writing an ending that will satisfy readers. The advice is clear and easy to understand. The book also includes lots of information for short-story writers (who often get forgotten in other books). I didn't give it 5 stars because there are other books that I feel cover this topic and then some (Plot and Structure, for example). Elements of Fiction Writing is a great series. I recommend the series to all aspiring writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in this series","review":"My favorite in this series, this book is the definitive source in describing how important each part of your book is to the overall story. I ended up re-writing the first three chapters of my novel based on the author's excellent advice. She gives specific examples of how to grab the reader from the very first sentence, keep him/her reading the first few pages, and holding their attention all the way to the climax. A must for any writer's library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big help","review":"This book I read in christmas and it has been a very good help for me to write the end of a book I am working with.

I never saw any other book on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Any Aspiring Writer","review":"This is a writing reference book, but I think anyone could read this and get something out of it. One would expect that a writing reference book would be a drag to read, but I just wanted to continue turning the pages in this book. The author breaks down a story into the three parts: beginning, middle, and end, and she discusses on what makes each part good and each part bad. She cites many examples from stories as well as writes her own example for each section. Her techniques and suggestions seem very practical, and I think I will keep this book forever for reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Served it's purpose","review":"This car seat worked out well for us. All the features were amazing and the base was heavy which made me feel safe when sticking the car seat in it. I didn't give it 5 stars because we had a problem adjusting the crotch strap. It is removable but we had to break out tools to get the metal part out of the grooves. Other than that, it worked out well and served its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you have a preemie, don't bother","review":"My son is 4 months old, and he has already outgrown the seat. Well, I should say he has outgrown the straps.He is not overly large for a baby at 16lbs. His height isn't even that much over 50% for his age. Even with nothing on but a romper, the straps are so tight around his shoulders and the strap between his legs is so short that I feel like I'm going to break him just keeping it all together.I know this seat got a great rating when safety testing - it's why I purchased it. But they could not have possibly actually testing its safety with a typical 6 month old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it.

I give it two stars because my child will never be harmed in it.

It was great when my baby was very little (0-3 months), but she is now just over 4 months and we can barely fit her in the seat! The belts are so tight they smash her shoulders and most of the time cannot even slip over her shoulder properly...they fall to where they are around the side of her upper arm!! She is not a particularly big baby. She weighs about 16 pounds and is 26.5-27 inches. I was very disappointed that I was unable to use this car seat as long as I hoped. I would suggest that, although pricey, your best bet is to get a convertible car seat such as the Britax Roundabout, because it is safe, convertible and will hold a child until she is 50 lbs!

She is in the 95th percentile at 13 lbs. Yes, I have loosened the straps as much as they will go. As of right now, I am barely able to squeeze her into it. I can't even put a sweatshirt on her or she will not fit. It's December in Massachusetts, and now I am shopping for a new car seat for our six week old. Unless you have a very tiny baby, don't bother with this seat.

In comparing the seat to Graco Snugride, however, I am very disappointed on the tough, very dense foam on the low back/sacral region of the seat. The foam goes down to a certain point on baby's low back, and then disappears, leaving a dip for baby's buttocks. Just imagine sitting in a recliner with support only down to the low-back region (with buttocks not supported) ...not comfortable. I wonder how a baby's backside would stand up to a traumatic jolt in that seat...well, I'm not going to take any chances. Baby Trend should have consulted a Physical Therapist (like me) before designing this seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible warranty policy","review":"I have a 12 week old and in that short time, the mechanism that allows the handle to rotate forward and back (carrying position to \\"in the car\\" position) has failed. Since the product is under warranty I called Baby Trend and they would only help me if I sent the car seat back to them for repair. Obviously, if I do that, I will have no means of transportation for my baby. I would need to buy a new car seat, which defeats the purpose of having it repaired! I spoke with the head of the customer service department who refused to send a replacement. I do not advise buying this or any other Baby Trend product that you cannot afford to lose for a few weeks to have repaired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good seat","review":"Overall, this is a very good carseat. Yes, the handle is difficult... but we rarely take ours out of the car anyway, so it doesn't matter to us. (We wear our baby when out and about). I love the turn-knob harness height adjuster, and I love how safe and comfy my babe looked in it-- until recently. This is the bad part: the straps are way too short! My 7-month-old is in the 50th %ile for height and weight, but if he's wearing a sweatshirt or even thick pants, I can barely buckle him in! Granted, his bum is a little fluffier than average since we cloth diaper, but still... the buckle strap is ridiculously short (and yes, I have let it out all the way). If it weren't for that, this seat would definitely get 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moving the handle is almost impossible!","review":"For our second child we bought this car seat (previously had a Graco) to fit into the matching Sit N Stand double stroller. Wish I found another seat that also fits, even if it won't be the same color. Great safety ratings, the triangle handle looks weird but I thought was comfortable, and easy to clean. However, it is very difficult to move the handle back (which you're supposed to do for safety) once you put the baby in the car. It takes a few tries to get it to move and is a real hassle. The strap length isn't very long either and my baby only weighs 13 pounds.I agree with other reviewers and would not buy this again despite the convenience of fitting well with my new carriage by the same brand (which I love and highly recommend)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film I want to see again and again","review":"I love this film.

In addition, there are some good bonus tracks, and amazon's price is great.Highest of recommendations"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bash!...That could have been the way","review":"Greatest of all Plant Solos. Though the 90s Page/Plant projects brought up some great moments in rock music, especially live, FATE OF NATIONS points the way to what could have been Robert Plants development into his very own style. Outstanding mixture of rock with folk elements, emotionally intense, passionate, with a variety of moods. Plant has integrated great musicians into this project, working together harmonically and creating a unique warm sound. Incredible percussion on DOWN TO THE SEA, listen to the outstanding folky COME INTO MY LIFE with Richard Thompson and Maire Brennan and the tragic I BELIEVE. 29 PALMS is the only chart ambitious song, don't miss the beautiful acoustic Tim Hardin piece IF I WERE A CARPENTER. THE GREATEST GIFT is probably one of Plants most wonderful ballads. The record ends with two powerful masterpieces, GREAT SPIRIT and NETWORK NEWS. This record is indeed a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best solo album","review":"When I purchased this CD back in 1993 just a few months after Coverdale/Page I was so impressed with what Robert had produced. The vocals are perfect for his voice. The earthy lyrics of 'I Believe, Come into my Life & The Greatest Gift' are fantastic. Has Robert sung a better song than the latter with more sprit ever in no Zep albums? I doubt it. Unledded was a great suprise, but this CD is unbelievable. The music is so timeless. Yes, it may not be the Plant of 1975 in Physical Graffitti, but please, he was almost 45 years old when this come out. This is a man not wishing he re-hash the past. Compare this to any solo album & this will stand up STILL in 20 years time. There is no 80'S sound or the wanna-be hair hard rock of the 'still good' Manic Nirvana.

I just enjoy. \\"I Believe\\", \\"Great Spirit\\" both renditions,\\"The Greatest Gift\\", \\"Colours of a Shade\\", and \\"29 Palms\\" are my favorites, but the whole album is enjoyable.

What an absolutely marvelous telling of this story with great wonders of the world revealed in all their splendour as Marco traveled. I won't say in real time, but compared to today's hyper-cutting pace, it will feel that way to the viewer. The rhythm of real conversations, treks, and developing relationships only add to the beauty and inspiration of each place and marvel.Every aspect of making the exploration of Marco Polo come to life is exquisite.

At the time of its release, the film was considered so grotesque that it ran into considerable censorship trouble in Europe, particularly in England. A very tight running running time (just over an hour) keeps the action flowing, and the laboratory scenes are particularly shuddery. A classic of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Universal Horror Curio","review":"\\"Murders in the Rue Morgue\\" (1932) was a consolation prize for Bela Lugosi and director Robert Florey, who lost out on \\"Frankenstein.\\" This very loose Edgar Allan Poe adaptation leans toward Caligari-styled expressionism, but gets bogged down in needless romantic and comic relief. Except for Lugosi's bravura performance as Dr. Mirakle, the acting is terribly weak for a Universal chiller. However, there is a brief appearance by Arlene Francis as one of Bela's victims. The film would have been stronger without the post-production tampering and cries for a major re-edit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bela's Bombshell","review":"Murders in the Rue Morgue is one hour and one minute long and was released on February 21, 1932. If there is a plot to this movie I could not find one. Murders in the Rue Morgue is set in 1845 Paris, France and it is based very loosely on the by Edgar Allen Poe by the same name. The movie stars Bela Lugosi as Dr. Mirakle. Dr. Mirakle is abducting women off the streets and inserting his pet gorilla blood into them so Erik (his gorilla) can have a mate. Only females with pure clean blood will the serum work on. Finally he finds one, but Erik kills Dr. Mirakle and kidnaps Camille L'Espanaye. His death ends when Pierre Dupin shoots him. The sound in this movie is horrible in the beginning. I can barely understand what is said in the first twenty minutes. This gets a D on my list.

This question kick starts De Landa's most famous book, detailing the history of the \\"war-machine\\" through the eyes of Deleuzian philosophy. I can't say I totally get Deleuze, but his project excites me in those rare moments I can parse it. De Landa does a great job of bringing Deleuze's philosophy into the real world and showing us how many of Deleuze's concepts can be made to do work in the disciplines of history and the social sciences. I can't really make any claims about how important this book is, or even how important De Landa and Deleuze are, but I love this book, it makes philosophy fun, kind of like watching a really great action movie, where ideas are the heroes. Happy to have it on my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dubious Sources","review":"De Landa's theoretical connections are interesting and thought provoking but are unfortunately very often not adequately cited. In his attempt to explain the entire development of warfare, De Landa displays only a cursory knowledge of his topic frequently neglecting to mention crucial information.

The theoretical leaps it makes are admirable.

One thing that you can say about him is that he is a fine musician in EVERYTHING he does. This is my second favorite as I do like \\"The Joy of Molybdenum\\" better. This is much sounder than his third CD and different than \\"The Big Star\\", which I also like. The thing about Trey is how much he is influenced by King Crimson and how large a part of that bands overall sound he influences. It is not a bad thing and often I would rather listen to one of his solo effort away from KC to really appreciate the music. This is a really great CD! You be the judge. Great spin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Study of Star Trek Autographs","review":"There is so much more to know and write on this subject.

It was a meek soup, almost as if they created a black bean base, tossed some veggies in and left it at that. Uh...where are the spices?! The herbs?! The excitement!Only after adding some hot sauce, salt, pepper, garlic, cumin, and sour cream did the soup become worthy to be eaten with the rest of my lunch.If you are a fan of more mild soups, this could be for you.

This is the first time I tried Amy's products and I was very disappointed. First of all, I was expecting there to actually be black beans in it but it was more like a black bean puree. But thats the least of problems with this soup. It had a very distinct, and to me, disgusting flavor that I cannot pinpoint. Possibly the leeks? Or maybe the spice combination was off. I could not even finish eating it. I brought it to work to have for lunch and ended up throwing it out and getting some peanut butter sandwich crakers from the vending machine instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onions overwhelm otherwise low-key flavor","review":"The onions are overwhelming in a sharp, bitter sort of way.

I hated the flavor of this soup, which was disappointing since I love black beans and I love Amy's products. It hardly tasted like black bean soup, it was so sweet and bitter at the same time... tangy, but not in a good way. After I forced myself to finish most of it, I suffered from really bad heartburn afterwards. Some people may like the taste, but I definitely did NOT enjoy it. Like the other user said, the only reason this soup deserves 2 stars is because it is healthy.I tried McDougall's Black Bean & Lime soup before and I thought it tasted pretty good; definitely a good alternative to Amy's black bean vegetable.Dr. McDougall's Vegan Black Bean & Lime Soup, 3.4-Ounce Cups (Pack of 12)"},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly bland; worst black bean soup I've had","review":"While the ingredients may be organic and healthy, the soup is bland and impossible to eat without having to basically re-make it. It has no flavor at all, except perhaps a nagging sweetness from the corn. If you are interested in a savory treat or something healthy AND delicious, then find something else, or be ready to whip out your pot and start over. I'll never buy this again.

It's not that it crosses the PC boundry, CYE is just not funny. It's like the joke without the punchline; it builds potential, then flops. There might be one decent joke in an episode, but it's not worth suffering to get to.

In an earlier season, a blind guy wants to date a hot woman, and he is eventually sent on a date with a Muslim woman who is covered from head to toe due to her religion. How perfect of a match is that? A man who can't see gets to date a woman who can't be seen. I won't spoil what happens...needless to say it's funny. This is just one of the many, many, many similar hysterical situations that Larry David goes through.

The phone is decent, but the keys are cheap. However it works well, and I don't mind that. This is still the first week, so I do not know how it'll work in the long term though....One potential shortcoming is that this phone only works with two SEPARATE phone lines. So for example if you have a phone jack with both line 1 & 2 coming out of one jack, the phone will not be able to recognize line 2. I had to get a A/B splitter to get the phone working. It was cheap though - 6 bucks........."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-line phone","review":"This phone has a glaring omission, namely, it does not accommodate a duplexed line.

It seemed like a good value at the time. But having had it for a while now I've become dissappointed. The sound quality is not very good. Sound is not clear with a constant background hissing static. And the volume is low even at max volume. But the most significant problem with this phone is that it drops about 30-40% of the incoming calls when you answer them. You press the button to answer and the handset starts searching for the base unit, dropping the call. Problem exists on all my handsets. Will not buy VTech again, as I've heard others complain of same problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handsets reboot frequently","review":"I have owned this system for several years, and have also experienced frequently dropped calls, due to the handsets periodically crashing and rebooting when a call is picked up. Also, the headset jacks mounts are held in place soley by the cheap and flimsy solder joints on the circuit board, which is unacceptable for the type of traffic a cordless phone experiences. Two out of three headset jacks on my system had become non-functional after 18 months of normal use. My sister had a similar experience with a completely different VTech model. There is no indication from VTech that this design sloppiness has been addressed in subsequent models, so no more VTech in my future.

So what I can't figure out is why these two adults find no problem with the fact that after mommy goes to work, daddy jumps in his son's bed for a half hour to read(?) And when daddy's taking a bath in Mr. Bubble or (probably a much more expensive bath additive that mommy has bought in order to coddle one of daddy's child alters) mommy has no problem plunking the kid in there with him.

The author seemed very narcissitic(i.e. constant descriptions of his cars and his clothes). The only reason why I kept reading was because I was hoping it would get better. I did, however,enjoy how he blamed his \\"personalities\\" for his extra-marital affairs. I really didn't care for this book. It didn't tell me anything interesting about DID that I didn't know already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly one of the worst-written books I've ever read.","review":"This is one of those books that makes you stare at the New York Times bestseller list and wonder how a book so badly written, so full of pseudo-science, so...lame, could possibly make the list.From the endless mentions of the brands of his and his wife's clothing to the excruciatingly purple prose to the oh-so-perfect cinematic unfolding of this story, this book was a disaster. A combination of Robert James Waller and John Gray."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good fiction read...???","review":"I'm pretty gullible, but halfway thru this book, I came to check other reviews to see if it was just me, or if this struck others as unbelievable. I certainly don't want to denounce this man if it's all true, but his book surely doesn't read that way. As others have mentioned, the reference to his Benz and Volvo and LL Bean are annoying, and the description of details of which he was not a part makes me skeptical. I've always been fascinated by DID info, but other books I've read ring more true. I'm enjoying the reading, but I don't believe it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked it but I didn't","review":"This book is only interesting because of the subject. My apologies to Cameron West but he should have gotten someone else to write this book for him as I found his appalling writing constantly distracted me from his tale. However, fair play to him for having the courage to write it in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Saw Myself","review":"Many multiples I know hate this book. They complain that they, unlike West, can't just pack it all in and move to California when things get rough. They have bigger problems as to whether or not they'll have to sell that second car. And I agree with them there. On the other hand, it WAS well written and presented--at least in my opinion--a good view of what dissociation is like. This was the first book I ever read about multiplicity and I saw myself in it to a certain degree. It helped me know I wasn't alone. Then again, I think all multiples have a soft spot for that first book that made them go, \\"THAT's what it is.\\" Maybe I'm just soft-hearted, but I'm looking forward to this one being made into a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"From tears to laughter to tears again!!!","review":"I must honestly say that I haven't finished a book in fifteen years, this one I couldn't put down. Dr. West is an inspiration to all person's diagnosed with DID.

Thank You Dr. West for your courage and writing this book. Thank God for \\"The Comfort Room\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This could be me","review":"This book explains DID better than any I have read yet. As a multiple, I found it incredibly comforting to know that I am not the only one who feels like this. Also, having my mom read it helped her to understand what it is like for me as a multiple. I highly recommend this book. The only caution is that the description of his abuse is pretty detailed, which may trigger a multiple. However, the rest of the book makes up for it. I read it in 2 days, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm different because I read this","review":"I've been a skeptic my whole life, believing that memory is something solid.

As the significant other of a wonderful woman with DID, I found First Person Plural to be one of the most helpful books I've read on the subject. The majority of 'first person\\" accounts I have read on the subject were by people who were not in a long-term relationship. It was very valuable to me to see the struggles that Rikki, Cam's wife, faced and how she/they dealt with them. Another extremely valuable portion of the book dealt with \\"Denial's Rake.\\" This seems to always be a major hurdle in DID therapy, and the innovative way it was dealt with is a tremendous inspiration. I hope that we will be able to use some of the techniques in this book to move toward healing. I strongly recommend this book to all people with loved ones suffering with DID."},{"rating":"2","title":"True or not.....it's great!","review":"I've read many differing reviews regarding the validity of this book and quite honestly, I don't care if it is true or not. I rarely have the time to sit and read a good book but this one caught my interest and once I started reading it, I couldn't put it down. If it is true, then hooray for Dr. West and his family and the incredible struggle they are working through (Rikki, you're my hero!). If it's not true, then congratulations to Dr. West for putting together an incredible story. Either way, it's great reading and very inspiring. Get it. Read it. I guarantee you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"I was mislead by the four and 1/2 star rating this book has as it is very poorly written and lacks any substance. It is filled mostly with uninteresting chatter amongst the personalities and a kind of day to day diary of conversations between all his alters and only vague references of what happened to this person in his past. This is certainly nothing like the story of 'Sybil'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could've been better","review":"This book would have been good if you are into that type of thing. I personally didn't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"There aren't enough synonyms for \\"bad\\" to describe this book.","review":"I bought this book in a second hand bookstore and before I finished the first chapter I was already distracted by West's appalling overuse of groan-inducing metaphors. This book must contain the largest collection of bad metaphors ever published. You can scarely turn a page without being assaulted by another embarrassingly dreadful metaphor, or an irrelevant, boasting description of his cars, clothes, appliances, etc. The impression I was left with (besides the fact that this guy REALLY should have gotten someone else to write the book for him, or at the very least should have found a competent editor), is that it's fake. I don't doubt that Mr. West has psychological issues, but more than anything, you get the impression that this is a man who craves attention. It's obvious that West wrote the story with a movie in mind, as it reads like a bad screen play. I believe in DID, but I don't believe Mr. West."},{"rating":"1","title":"shabby condition","review":"Foolish on my part to order this book online. The copy is yellowish and brittle and very worn. After shipping costs I paid as much as I would have for a brand new copy. Live and learn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"I saw Cam and his wife on LEEZA, of course, to find out more info on the subject of DID I bought the book. I am not one to pick up a book and read but this one was hard to put down. Cam gives vivid accounts of all of his 24 alters (some very graphic). It let us understand what someone with DID must have endured and the patience, compassion and love Rikki has to live with a person with DID. His style of writing it made it easy to read, it felt like you were in his shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. West provides an excellent first person account.","review":"I read this book in two nights. I had a difficult time putting this book down. Dr. West shows us how his life and his family's life has changed through this experience. He is articulate and emotional. I immediately connected with this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, easy read, went very quickly","review":"I found that just about *anyone* could read this book--very informative, and excellent descriptions and associations so everyone can understand. I felt the time span ran very quickly, like the day-to-day stuff was kind of skipped. But all in all, I would highly recommend it to all I know. I wanted to know a little bit more about his past and his further associations (if any) with his mother, his thoughts on the whole trauma, rather than his thoughts for his wife. How has his family coped? Has he any communications with any of them, especially his brother? A little bit of a follow up would have been nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Must-Read","review":"I found this book a difficult read. The writing was very choppy, which caused me to wonder if perhaps if the various personalities were constantly interrupting each other as the paragraphs were written. I'm sure in other hands, this book would make an excellent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating","review":"Being a friend of the author I was looking forward to a unique experience, to say I was rivited is an understatement! Cameron takes you on a journey that will make you stop and take a deep breath, and question anybody who ever doubted the existence of DID. I've enjoyed this book twice, and can't wait to see his next effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tribute to the human mind and its ability to protect us","review":"This book will grip you from the first page. Imagine consulting your entire extended family before you choose an ice cream flavour and you begin to get an idea of Cameron West's world. You will run the entire gamut of emotions in the very short time it will take you to read First Person Plural (you won't be able to put it down) and will finish it realising how very disgusting and how very amazing people can be. A standing ovation, too, for Rikki West who is undoubtedly a singular woman. Absorbing, mind-blowing and ultimately readable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant insight","review":"I started reading this book the day it arrived. It was so engaging that I finished the book the same day I started it. I just couldn't put it down. As a person who is a survivor of trauma and also has the diagnosis of DID, this book was inspirational because it focuses on one fundamental problem that I knew was there...but haven't been able to put words on. The problem being, in the words of Dr. West, \\"Denial's Rake\\". Armed with this new and remarkable insight I believe that I have uncovered my first goal in therapy. I want to thank Dr. West and his family, his therapists and all of those who have helped put this book out there for all of us to read. I have found the hope we were looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutly great book","review":"First Person Plural is a great book for anyone who is interested in Dissociative Identity Disorder(DID).

First Person Plural is filled with heart-warming content, suspense, and humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake","review":"Based on my personal experience, I have a hard time buying into this persons process.

I think the writer of this book is secretly laughing at all of us who purchased this book and I sincerely feel this guy wrote this book as a psychology student joke.If you want to read the best book on this disorder read The Minds of Billy Mulligan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment to a health care practitioner","review":"I bought this book hoping for an interesting and not too challenging read for a long flight. I certainly got 'not too challenging.' Mr. West has got my respect for getting a quick trip to Hollywood. He certainly had Robin Williams in mind for the lead when he wrote the book. I feel like a fool for spending my hard earned cash on this nonsense. Not only transparent, but written like an amateur without an editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and Harrowing account","review":"A very harrowing account of what multiple personality disorder can do to a life, in addition to being a rather stunning portrait of what the human mind can be capable of. It also tells the story of his wife and child who try and cope with his disease. The book is occasionally melodramatic, especially the subplot about his worries of infidelity. While the writing can feel self conscious and some passages seem to be using words in a way to sound \\"literary\\", it is a riveting work and a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"multiple personalities, only two stars","review":"as a reader who is just a reader, not someone experienced with this illness, my review should be read as such. there was more that i didn't like about this novel than i liked. i immediately draw offense at writers who describe everyone by their physical or material attributes (everyone wears brand names and is \\"handsome\\"?? how beautiful must the US psychiatric scene be!! lucky everyone has a mercedes), and found the dialogue slow and, amazingly, the content simple. i would have liked to hear more in depth from the \\"alters\\" who particularly appealed to me such as Clay and Bart - maybe whole chapters so we could get a sense of them and how their lives were structured. maybe not possible? in short, multiple disappointments, as i read this book imagining the author (who is, coincidentally, \\"handsome\\") selling the film rights and talking about it to Oprah without knowing he'd actually done same. talk about mind-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having Dissociative Identity Disorder I was disappointed.","review":"I saw Dr. West on Oprah and was excited to hear of his book. I also have Dissociative Identity Disorder. This excitement did not last long.The author gives a very simplistic description of Dissociative Identity Disorder. A great opportunity has been lost to share with others the inside world of a Multiple.The pages are filled with endless \\"rules\\" and \\"whining\\" on the part ofthe spouse. The author leads the reader into great detail about his spouse's experiences and anger. Such detail leaves the reader pondering... \\"who is telling the story\\". Empty handed, the reader walks away with the impression, having D.I.D. is a burden to those around them, rather than a wonderful wayin which the mind copes with horrendous trauma.One may indeed wonder how Robin Williams will take such a book and truly illustrate what a person with Dissociative Identity Disorder experiences.Pamela"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book- sometimes graphic- but truly heart wrenching","review":"I really enjoyed this book I would recommend it to anyone interested in Psychology, or DID. Cameron West went through a truly emotional ordeal and I think he did a good job of portraying it through his bio. Some descriptions of the abuse were very graphic- it was hard for me to fall asleep after reading a few chapters! Overall I think it's an excellent book that will move a person, and make a person realize how important childhood is everyones life."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY ASTOUNDING","review":"After seeing the interview on Oprah...I was completely intrigued. I finished the book in less that one day. It is completely inspiring..to see what human being can accomplish with massive effort and drive. I finished the book thinking..If this guy can accomplish all this, survive the brutal abuse, deal with all of the personalities, work for a Phd....it makes me think I can be a better person and accomplish anything!! Thank You Cameron West...you are truly an inspitiation. I also understand he's writing a novel...I can't wait to read it!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding!","review":"I will be blunt. This is one of the most fascinating and intriguing books I have ever read. We learn so much about the spirit of one man, who not only has to cope with himself but terrible memories not even related by him, but the different parts of him (hope that makes sense). At times the writing is a little weak and there were pages that could of been cut, but Cameron's writing becomes better as the book progresses. All the best of luck Cameron in whatever you do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Venus to the Hoop","review":"Venus to the Hoop is a motivation to every kind of athlete. If you have ever played basketball you may be able to understand the situations these women athletes were put in. The detailed descriptions of the players and their coaches and staff allows you to understand the atmosphere they had to play basketball in. If you want to read a good book and also get some posative thinking out of it, read Venus to the Hoop. This book has really helped me keep a positive attitude about sports, teammates and life. I loved the way the competitors from the past pulled together and played as one on the same team. The way they helped eachother out in games and off the court helped me realize that they loved playing basketball. Keeping a positive attitude is important to me, and this book made me look at my life more positively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basketball as a metaphor for women's lives!","review":"Sara Corbett's book is action-packed and beautifully written,but it's more than a story about the phenomenal rise of women'sbasketball and what the athletes who love the sport had to go through to get their new leagues: \\"Venus to the Hoop\\" is about women's lives and conflicts; about finding a new, strong vision of femininity; about women who pursue their dreams despite all odds.

This is the exact and demanding science that redeems the soul. This is not an easy book to comprehend, as it is written for the Consciousness, not the mind. The mind seeks diversions and entertainment: this book gives solid and practical guidance for any serious aspirant to make definitive and concrete progress in the Path of the Razor's Edge.

I see that the publisher compares this work to that of Burroughs and Brackett, but those authors (in addition to creating exotic planetary scenery) could TELL A GOOD STORY. Here, I guarantee most readers will lose interest in these characters about halfway through the story.

Notable character performance by Ben Chaplin. Olivia Lovibond was a nice eye-candy at the beginning of the movie.Colin plays the lead character whom struggles to get his life together again after serving prison time. The movie seemed to emphasize more on the dark-side of human nature and not enough on redemption and change for the better good.On a side note, I did hope for a severe punishment for the duo-gangster-teenagers but was totally dissappointed at the end of the movie.Colin's character (Mitchel) should have continued-on but the creators of this movie are too engross in the era of 'the Departed', 'Gangs of New York'.

It apparently rips off Nicholas Roeg's incredibly great film Performance (as in Performance, London Blvd has a rolls royce, a house in a dumpy area of London, a hero who's been in prison, a failed artists, etc). But London Blvd is entirely banal. You can see the ending coming an hour away. William Monahan wrote the screenplay and directed. It's quite an atrocious film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't see this!!!","review":"I hated this movie; thought it was ridiculous, especially its ending.

Not bad setup and the villain is a lot of fun -- he does just about everything except curl his mustaches. Unfortunately it feels as though Wallace was truly making this one up as he went along: what starts out as a \\"unjust man sentenced to prison\\" story suddenly changes channels (and protagonists!) into a \\"arch criminal versus brilliant investigator\\" story, and just as that's starting to catch fire it shifts *again* to a whodunit (and not a very good one, incidentally, mysteries as such were not Wallace's strength). As such, this can't be considered one of the better Wallaces, while he always sort of \\"made it up as he went along\\", his best books cohere a lot better than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's Mission AND Mindset","review":"This is NOT just a great book for cross-cultural missionaries: it's a MUST for every Christian worker because it reminds us that we cannot continue Christ's mission without also having His mindset - humble, loving service. It wasn't just Jesus' work that influenced the masses, it was His attitude and His spirit. Jesus affirmed individuals by valuing and esteeming them. Duane Elmer said it this way, \\"We are inclined to think too much of ourselves and too little of our neighbor . . . . To accept and affirm the dignity of the other will nurture the image of God in them. To devalue that person or fail to show respect will contribute to a further distortion of the image of God in them.\\" I wish I could have read this decades ago because while I think my service has been good-intentioned, it has not always been clothed in humility and love.

The virtual graffiti screen is awesome. It shows the strokes as you make them which has greatly improved my accuracy.

Green and Short describe nearly all of the world's seagrasses, complete with line drawings and species comparisons, and map their distribution. They also include info on preservation, destruction, etc. It is an invaluable resource for anyone needing to identify or locate seagrasses. I was disappointed, however, when I received \\"World Atlas of Coral Reefs\\". The entire text is devoted to describing areas where reefs are found, but rarely mentions anything about the corals themselves! I saw <Diadema> listed more often than any coral genus! If you want to learn about the per capita fish consumption of Mauritius or phosphate mining on the atoll of Nauru, this is the book for you.

The album starts off slow but does pick up with three great tracks of observations and jokes in the middle, \\"Michael Jackson,\\" \\"Ilaldo,\\" and \\"White Kids/Black Kids.\\" Here he rips apart celebrities like the Jackson family and Geraldo as well as child rearing.

I expected to have to do some experimentation, but not nearly to the degree that I have had to with a product published by Adobe.

Objectivism favors people who do whatever they want to do, listening to no one's advice, unconcerned for the damage they may be doing to others. It mistrusts sacrifice, calling it manipulative.The book in a treatise with dialogue slipped in between harangues. Caldwell's device is constant flashbacks to the early days of the hero, who is in a hospital, catatonic after attempting--but failing--suicide. Characters are heroic or wimps--no shadows here.

I escalated within Sony and got the price down to $170, but they still won't fix it under warranty. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED in SONY. I thought this unit was last for years, like my Palm IIIc that it replaced. I was wrong. Sony caused me to lose my employer's trust for decisions like this.

News flash: there are fatal programming and hardware issues with the Clie NR70! This is why Sony discontinued this model after only a few months of sales.The NR70 is a great PDA due to the conceptual design. This is why I am urging people to buy the PEG-NX70(v). They have improved on the software and hardware. This unit runs the Palm OS 5.0, way better! Also, they replaced the plastic casing with a more sturdy metal casing ( a bit heavier, but worth it, as my first unit was returned for the case cracking umong other things).

I have had mine about six months now and I have used them all and I have not had any problems. I mainly use it for my DVD and CD databases and games, but all the capabilities are amazing.

Neither feature is impressive. The keyboard is hard to get used to -- it feels unresponsive and stiff compared to the excellent RIM Blackberry's keyboard, and the camera would probably give you 2 hours of fun before it hits you that you'll probably never use it again, esp. since this is not a wireless unit where you can e-mail pictures to friends. The weight is tremendous, although it does come with decent multimedia functions such as MP3.

Why, well since I'm only 12 I thought it was the best basically because of its flip and rotate design. When I saw this on the internet, I had to get it right away cause of the following: the built in camera for taking pictures, the MP3 player that also plays Atrac format songs, four ways to write on it, the color silver, and most of all it's a Sony. Some of the few problems are that the keyboard is a bit too small, the clock is always slow two or three minutes, there's only really about 10 megabytes worth of memory since the programming that the factory programmed takes about 5m.

This one is jarring in places - you can clearly see where Clive Cussler left off and Craig Dirgo picked up. Dirgo is not a good writer. I found some inaccuracies, which I know Cussler didn't make, because his research is meticulous. It's too bad, this could have been a better book with the right writer.The only reason I am keeping this book is because I'm in the last chapter (which I helped write, which means it was written well).

Cussler presents a vignette that describes or speculates on the final moments of a ship or other artifact, and then describes the efforts of NUMA to locate the item in question. This combination of forgotten history and adventure is well written, and is easily as entertaining as Cussler's excellent fiction. Cussler approaches his subject matter with just the right touch of reverence for those souls lost in the wrecks he describes, along with a great sense of humor regarding his recovery attempts that did not go as planned. I hope a \\"Sea Hunters III\\" will be in the works at some time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I enjoyed the first, but this one....","review":"I really enjoyed the first volume, but as I read this one something began to bother me. I couldn't put my finger on it until about page 108 when Cussler, or should I say Dirgo, details a friend's sense of humour.The friend refuses to stow his bag on the plane, because it really isn't against FAA regulations not to. The flight attendant has to deal with this fellow, who Cussler tells us is an FAA investigator, and a retired Col. in the Air Force, as he refuses to do as she asks.

The usefulness rests in the fact that Putnam illustrates the extent to which group membership provides positive benefits for society and community members. What Putnam argues is that being a member of civic groups and associations will provide participants with the skills needed to develop greater political efficacy. This is a good thing, but it can only come if individuals possess the time to devote to joining clubs. Putnam even argues that women leaving home is part of the reason we see fewer clubs and groups. The lesson of this book is that we should encourage membership and to make the environment more favorable to such participation. Anyway, the book is well read and not to over written. It is as enjoyable as a political book can be. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Putnam hits on some important issues you can't ignore","review":"First of all, this is a relatively easy read and very intriguing. I just couldn't put it down. Putnam presents good evidence that social capital has indeed declined. Most of his statistical work is in good order. Most people would have a tough time disproving Putnam's evidence. But I am also a critical reader. I think he fell a little short in the \\"Why\\" section. I feel that the nature of social capital is changing (as technology and civilization progress) and Putnam doesn't touch on that enough. Also, some of his graphs and charts in this section are arbitrary. Overall it is a good book that looks at a potentially serious problem. All that being said, I recommend this book to anyone who cares about the society they live in. It is certainly an eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"most important read","review":"I found Bowling Alone to be the most important book I've read in a long time. It gives us an honest but sympathetic portraitof the increasing lonely and unconnected American people and the world we've created for ourselves. Putnam manages to display the many faces of community, or lack thereof, in a careful, balanced, and frigetning way. My only regret is that Putnam's \\"solutions\\" for our current atomization are less developed than the rest of the book.A must-read for anyone who cares about American society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other Possible Reasons Social Capital Has Decayed","review":"Dr. Putman's social capital destroying \\"suspects\\" (featuring TV) are solid. Here are some other candidates for future consideration: 1. Interest in genealogy/history (a.k.a. backward-temporal communities). 2. Rampant progenyism as acted out in hyper-child centricity/ kidolatry--may be associated with the fall of faith. 3. Layering on of additional very weak but still cumulatively important (and time requiring) domains of community, e.g. financial markets since we are now mostly security (stocks and/or bonds) holders and just the privatization of retirement planning in general. Maybe even some \\"Main-drain\\" from NAFTA, NATO and the general expansion of a global consciousness. 4. The increase in \\"homework\\" required to keep up to date with best pratices in a job. 5. The democratization of reading via another \\"screen\\": the affordable, pocket paperback book."},{"rating":"1","title":"another economistic view on social life","review":"booo! booo! this book, while well written and accessible, is ultimately just another book that enforces the commodification of everything, all the way to our personal interactions. the essential elements of modern society that he diagnoses are on point, but then his analysis is way off point and unreflective of our actual conditions. it is purely a reactionary piece that doesn't look at root causes of why our social and civil lives are disintegrating, but only enforces the alienation that already exists by blanketing the social with the economic. a superficial view that should only be used as a supplemental text."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZ.......","review":"The title of this book is so much more promising that the actual body.

Putnams conclusion was very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"I am currently enrolled in American Society and this is the corresponding textbook. After reading some is its chapters, Putnam seems to contradict himself at the end. How can you make sense of his work, interviews, experiments, and outlined research if is objective to his own views?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't belive the hype","review":"I read this book about 2 years ago for a class. It was just horrible, and I am shocked that smart people can read this and not see it for what it is. Nothing he said was realy a new idea unless it was one of the areas where he was wrong. He will bury you in 20 pages of Evidence in numbers to support his idea, but fail to notice a huge glaring fault with his logic. He basicly hopes you get so into what evidence he puts out you will not think, wait he did not even factor in X, and that destorys anything he said. My class had to ask why we even read this, as it was so bad, and evry day was basicly a hour of talking about how wrong he is. This book should only be used to show how lots of numbers can make people fail to think logicly about anything. I know people will say this is a great book, but is worthless. Even the Title seems wrong, we have a very hard time find a lane that does not have Leagues going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive Networking and Social Capital.","review":"Putnam has hit the nail right on the head. Public policy makers world-wide have taken note. His constructs of 'bonding'and 'bridging' to the broader community through social networks to add value, or social capital, to society have gained wide currency. His research is exhaustive, more than necessary perhaps to make the case for disengagement of citizens. But, he has confirmed empirically what so many know intuitively to be true, hence the appeal of his findings. His recent work with John Helliwell published in the 2004 proceedings of the Royal Society on social capital and well-being, reported in the media as the science of happiness and the object in my own work on positive networking, advances the discipline even further. Positive networking works, it takes leadership and, when done right, adds social capital to the community. Putnam's work is compelling. His arguements are powerful...highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do NOT recommend this product.","review":"I have been straining yogurt in a plastic bowl with cheese cloth with great results for a long time. I thought this might be an easier way to do it, but I was wrong. The yogurt basket sits too low in this container, allowing the yogurt to \\"sit\\" in the whey. Also, I like to make very firm yogurt cheese and so I leave my yogurt in the cheese cloth up to 3 days. This did not work well in the Cuisipro Donvier. Having the yogurt in contact with the metal screen for that length of time caused the yogurt to become discolored and actually smell very \\"off\\". I threw away the entire batch of yogurt and whey.I will never use this to separate yogurt again, unless I simply remove the screen insert and use cheese cloth instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!

The result was perfect. The thick part is held into the top portion and the water collects at the bottom. I can now use organic milk to make my own greek yogourt. It makes a small batch at a time, but is perfect for non commercial users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I love Greek-style yogurt and have been paying a premium price for it at the grocery store. However, since I bought this yogurt maker, I've been able to make my own for much less than what I was paying. The yogurt tastes wonderful and it's quick and easy.

The yogurt usually pulls up from the screen without squishing into the mesh, allowing for less waste. The best part of it for me is that it is a closed container. I was using a strainer over a bowl with the handle sticking out and a piece of plastic wrap over the top. So, this make a cleaner package in the fridge. It doesn't quite hold the full amount of my yogurt maker's container, so I have to do it two rounds.

So to make a couple cups of greek style yogurt you have to strain about 4-6 cups of thick yogurt. Also you are not left with nice clear whey that can be used for making bread or other recipes, you end up with a half yogurt half whey, mess. I returned mine because I don't wish to spend 2-3 days just to make a couple cups, nor do I like throwing half my yogurt away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product","review":"I have tried many methods of straining the whey from fresh homemade yogurt.

Yogurt cheese was tasty and, by using low fat yogurt, healthier. As I tried to get a denser cheese I discovered two spots (1/4 by 3/4 inch and 1/4 by 1/4 inch) in the mesh that had turned a dark brown. Upon rubbing them with my soaped fingers, the mesh fell apart into granules of corroded mesh. The dark brown spots were rust!

The instructions for cleaning only stated to clean with soap just before each use. I washed it with warm soapy water and it still smelled. I allowed it to soak in hot soapy water for an hour or so. The smell was pretty much gone, so I decided to go ahead and try it out. I allowed it to strain for nearly 24 hours. When I dumped the cheese out, what was closest to the mesh had a grey color and the cheese had a metalic smell. I scraped off the grey layer and tasted it and it had a metalic taste. I am going to run the cheese maker through the dishwasher and try it one more time. If I get the metalic taste/smell again, I am returning it and I'll just use cheesecloth to make it.

In a matter of hours the liquid will drain and collect in the bottom of the vessel leaving you with smooth and rich yogurt cheese.Cleans easily and thoroughly with soap and water.My one criticism, albeit it a small one, is that the container is just a bit too small to hold an entire container of 2 lb. yogurt without mess.

There wasn't enough room in the Maker for a decent amount of cheese to form. How to rate this item? It's solidly constructed. Fits together well.

This charger from Magnadyne changed all that.1) The build quality is solid(If I dropped it for some reason, it doesn't feel like it would break).2) Three different ways to mount/install this:a) Mount with included harness and screwsb) Mount with included velcro from 3Mc) Hard wire it to your car3) Those four outlets are not for show. When all in use, there still is enough power to power everything plugged in.In summary, I would recommend this product.*Fitment* Fits inside the center console of an 2008 mazdaspeed 3 perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"USB ports work, but 12V sockets did not","review":"I was very disappointed in this. Both USB ports work fine, but neither 12V socket works. I tried it in multiple vehicles with functioning 12V sockets, so I know it wasn't the vehicle. In theory, this is great and the price was right. I wanted to be able to charge my phone and GPS at the same time, with an extra USB port if a passenger needed it, and the extra 12V port to use a power inverter for a laptop when needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad implementation","review":"Got the product, plugged it into my car, everything worked. Good news so far. The second time I used it, the USB ports didn't work. Maybe I blew a fuse on it, except the 12 V sockets were working. Just a defect in the USB ports. I got a refund, so the seller was great about it. And I know manufacturing is never 100% perfect, but I wasn't willing to try again. Bought something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.....","review":"The quality of sound through my iPod was significantly worse through this than with my stock socket.

Back to buy a 2nd one!!","review":"I have an XM radio SkyDock plugged in to my 2006 Toyota 4runner. The design of the Skydock's lighter plug makes it very stable and very difficult to remove. I added one of these unit's inside my center console then cut off the plug end and soldered the wires to the terminals on the existing lighter socket. Haven't had a single problem yet.If you are doing something similar, make sure you take into account the clearance you will need when the lid to the console is closed and something is plugged into one of the sockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, set it and forget it","review":"I purchased and began using this device in April 2012, and it has been working great ever since.

My blackberry 7130e didnt start charging until a few seconds after the charger was plugged in. It works so im not concerned.the usb ports have enough power to charge any USB device you can throw at it. I used this to supplement a high-speed portable hard drive that needed more power than my ultra portable laptop could supply it. so one plug went to PC usb for data and the other went to this baby and i was mint.Love the mounting equipment. velcro or screw mount..your choice!Cables and construction are solid and wire is heavy guage so it wont over heat under high load.BUY IT NOW"},{"rating":"2","title":"OK but has a problem as a hi-power USB source","review":"This works and it comes with the hardware to mount it somewhere so it won't slide around. As an extension and socket splitter it is OK.However they missed an essential trick on the USB power supply. If a device wants a smart USB powered device like an iPhone or iPod to see it as a high power source, and not as a data connection, it needs to short the data interface pins with a resistor not more than 200k ohms. That is in the USB spec. You can tell this hasn't been done because when you plug in an Android phone it asks if you want to mount as a media device or a hard drive.So if you are looking for a neat way to power and charge a modern smart device then this isn't it. For the 2c it would cost them for the resistors the manufacturers really should have done this. I may even try it myself since it looks like there is room to work in there and I have an electronics lab to play in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't like the power cord","review":"Good product but I wish the power cord came out the side and not the bottom.

Wish it had a switch","review":"I used this recently on a 1 day trip. Plugged a GPS unit and radar detector. The wire is long enough. So there is plenty of flexibility to keep it in my camry. You really don't have to mount it anywhere. Just keep it between the front two seats (by the hand brakes). I wish it had a ON/OFF switch on it. This way, I wouldn't have to pull out the car chargers from the sockets before I parked my car. I am not sure if leaving the car chargers in the ports when the car is shut down will consume the power from my car battery. Having a long wire and total of 4 ports + 1 extra fuse is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I have been struggling to find a quality power outlet for a very long time. I have tried many and all have failed me.This unit has finally broken my string of bad luck! Very impressed with the high quality construction and feel.

I got these discs because it stated it made a bandage over the sore. What they don't tell you is that they swell to twice the size and start oozing this horrible gel into your mouth that coats your teeth.

It was almost impossible to get it off and when I did finally remove it, it took some of my skin with it making the canker sore even bigger.

To get the pops out nicely, just run warm water over the bottom part for a few secounds till they pull out easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifyingly Bad!","review":"This is without a doubt one of the worst products I've purchased in years. It's so bad, that in my opinion the manufacturer is perpetrating a kind of fraud by continuing to market it. The chief problem with this piece of trash is that it is virtually impossible to get the frozen pops out of their molds. With great persistence and a little ingenuity, it can be done, but expect to be so frustrated that you'd just as soon throw the whole darn thing on the floor. It's inconceivable that Donvier doesn't know that this product is sheer, unadulterated rubbish. But they continue to sell it. If that doesn't tell you something about Donvier, then you should give your wallet to a responsible adult, because you're no longer qualified to shop for yourself. This product is garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like the ones already on my Tent Trailer","review":"I looked all over the Internet, and found the best price here on Amazon. I even checked local stores: The lowest price I found was 29.99 per stabilizer stand. I feel as though this company lost money on me, using Amazon Prime to ship this heavy item from the East coast to me in 2 days. This was an open box, so I was able to get it for a little less than I thought I would have to pay. The item arrived in near perfect condition with only a couple of scratches -- in places that would probably be scratched from normal use anyways. I was very skeptical to buy an open box item, but felt Amazon would take care of me if for any reason I wasn't satisfied.It also came with detailed directions which included the suggestion of what bolts to buy. This made installation on my tent trailer a breeze. My tent trailer is now complete with 2 existing jacks on the back, and these 2 new ones on the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall pleased","review":"Overall, I am very pleased with this product. There is one thing that concerns me . . . the handle is plastic, and when I turn the handle, I am concerned that one of these times it will break.

Either I did not see it, or it is not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this freezer!","review":"I love this freezer. I wish I had a bigger one, but for just my husband and myself it is great. You could actually serve 4 people very easily. I used one of the recipes in the book, and added a fresh ripe banana and it was great. The first time I put it in the freezer, I laid it on it's side and it wouldn't freeze the ice cream. I sat it upright after that in the freezer and have had no more problems. Clean up is a breeze, and it freezes every bit as well as my electric freezer. It is so easy. When I wash it, I just store it right back in the freezer and it is always ready to go for the next batch. It takes about 30 minutes to make a batch and I just stir it once or twice every three or four minutes. Nothing to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this Ice Cream Maker","review":"Believe it or not, I've had mine for 10 years and I still think it's the greatest.

Like others have said, you can keep the bowl in the freezer and make ice cream whenever you want to. However, I found that I rarely wanted to stand there and turn the crank by hand for that many minutes. There are several much better options. Cuisinart came out with an electric powered unit. And KitchenAid makes an attachment for their stand mixes. I own the Cuisinart double bowl model. We absolutely love it and no more sore arms!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work","review":"I have one. It only makes 1/2 pint at a time.

It takes a long time of having to sit there and wait to stir it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Freezer Setting Was the Culprit!","review":"We've had this ice cream maker for years now, and I never could figure out what I was doing wrong- cranking it every 3 minutes, sometimes for hours, and nothing ever firming up very much. Yesterday, after trying yet again unsuccessfully, I was ready to look for a different brand, but decided to look through Amazon reviews, just to see if anyone had any tips I hadn't tried yet... and read about setting the freezer to a colder setting. Well. I put the freezer on the coldest setting, had the canister in there for about 18 hours, and zowie- was able to make perfect ice cream in about 15 minutes this afternoon. Whew! Thank you, Amazon reviewers! I would give this 5 stars, but agree with others that Donvier should include something about this in the directions. Would have saved me much frustration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tool for homemade ice cream","review":"We have had one for years...I think the other reviewer who complained must have a freezer that is not very cold...Ours has always worked well.

The cooler the ingredients the quicker it freezes up.4. Basically I googled ice cream recipes and wen with the easiest.Here's an easy way.

The songs are all extremely well-written blasts of sonic pleasure that somehow merge the best of metal, punk, rock and pop together for an amazing sound unlike any other band - then or now. Melodic, even sing-along tunes, that all possess tight harmonies and rhythms.I won't bore anyone with my subjective take on the individual songs, but I have to say that if you're into melodic metal, with a heavy dose of punk and power pop, then you owe it to yourself to get this album.

My tastes in country run toward the likes of Garth Brooks, Travis Tritt, and Randy Travis, and Austin's album fits in that rock/pop-oriented country genre.Don't be mistaken, though- any record with a track called \\"Fiddle in the Middle\\" (with instrumentation to match) definitely counts as country in my book. The lyrics throughout the album are pure country, and often humorous if you pay attention. \\"Fiddle...\\", the title track, and \\"See You in Tijuana\\" are my early favorites after a few listens.Albums should be judged on the music, not on the artist's personal or business life, so Austin's rumored day job as an Internet tycoon is totally irrelevant here. I suggest people listen and judge for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This has got to be homemade. The backing tracks are canned,and the vocals are way to forward in the mix.

CleanSweep thinks that the software is installing when trying to play the game; after changing my cd-rom drive, this program no longer starts up on my computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!","review":"Ultra maniac is fun and satisfying. I am a big fan of Special A, The Familiar of Zero and Lovely Complex to name a few. This reminds me of all of them, but it has its own unique personality. Nina is a witch in training that can't seem to get any spells to go right. Ayu is a friend whom Nina 'tries to help', but all her attempts go hilariously awry. The first couple of discs are just fun and fluffy and the rest are a little darker; Nina battles her rival and tries to win hidden crystals to increase her magic. I recommend this to anyone who likes fun characters, good plots and lots of cute outfits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does anyone know if Q.Rose has other work available?","review":"She has an amazing voice and I can't seem to find any information on her.

So, today I started searching for Q Rose, and of course found nothing.But I found a duet on iTunes that you (Suzie Benson) did with Michael Bolton, and your voice was right there...beautiful.I will buy the Consenting Adults soundtrack just because of your fabulous voice.

I purchased an ATP 256MB SD card for my new Panasonic MiniDV 3CCD camcorder (PV-GS200) and it didn't work. My PV-GS200 can either read from or write to it. It simply says \\"NO DATA.\\" I tried two new ATP SD cards and none of them worked. The ATP card did, however, work with PV-GS120 model. So I returned them and bought a Sandisk brand and it worked perfectly. I think ATP needs to test their product compatibility more thoroughly before putting out the claim that it works with all Panasonic camcorders. I think it was really a waste of my time and energy on cheaper but also poorer quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The past in Alsace touchingly alive and immediate","review":"Remarkable primary source account of small-town Jewish life and customs in Alsace 150 years ago.

It is amazing to read what others think of this \\"ridiculous\\" movie made so long ago. I was 5 and my family and I were on vacation in Tennessee and my brother was flipping the channels and there it was, \\"Vernon, Florida\\". I still can't believe it! I can't believe people actually see it as such a funny movie. It is just ordinary people, ...who am I kidding... it is a riot. Believe it or not, I know Snake peronally (I even know his real name and why they call him Snake). The turkey hunter, well, I know where he lives. I run into him every now and again in town. And the church, well that was my church. *I want a copy of this movie. I think if Star Wars can be re-released, why not this Classic. Lastly, the turtle? It is a GOPHER and a turky gobble might just be the cure for diarrhea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique, but not that interesting","review":"Documentary from Errol Morris, made after his cult classic Gates of Heaven, and running at a mere 55 minutes; it's a miniature portrait of lower-income rural life in Florida, tracing the activities of several inhabitants of the small town called Vernon. At times the dialogue is unintelligible, and the characters overly esoteric and dimwitted to garner enough attention, but the film has a few interesting scenes such as the breathtaking opening and a bizarre sermon delivered by an absent-minded religious zealot. A fair work on the whole, and not up to the caliber of his other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"This movie is okay, but does not feel complete. The people in this one are not expressed enough in the movie, and I felt at the end that this played out more like a long trailer for a movie instead of a completed one. Morris had a good idea here, but it seemed too brief and desultory throughout. It's worth watching, but it leaves you wanting more depth and length. Possibly Morris at the time this was made had not totally developed his documentary style, it does play like a sort of practice film compared to other works such as Gates of Heaven and the First Person series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something different, that's for sure","review":"Many of the other reviews of this movie are glowing, and I won't dispute them. There are many fine features about the movie. Is it an interesting documentary? Yes. Are the people featured odd? Yes.So why, despite all of the glowing praise, did I not like *Vernon Florida*?There wasn't, so it seemed to me, a narrative thread. It was vignette after vignette as opposed to a cohesive narrative. And the one thing I want from a movie is some sort of plot. Even if the only reason for the plot to exist is so that one special effect after another can be shown.I suppose if I had approached the movie as a cinematic portrait, this cod liver oil of a movie would have gone down better. But I don't want cod liver oil when I see a movie, I want maple syrup--something unchallenging that might not be totally real. Should I want something a bit more edifying, I'll reach for a book.If wanting nothing more than diversion makes me a cinema philistine, then I am guilty as charged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as his other movies","review":"Being a big Errol Morris fan I was excited to find this in the local video store. Like other reviewers, however, I found it tedious and repetitive. Worse still was the plotless nature of it. I couldn't figure out the point of the movie (Disclaimer : I only watched half of it. Perhaps it all came together at the end.)If you want to see a good Errol Morris movie get \\"The Thin Blue Line \\" or \\"Fog of War\\". If you see this first it will put you off his other excellent work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Providing Color for the American Revolution","review":"As a serious collector of all things connected with the American Revolution I found this book to be a welcome addition to my collection.

I probably spend six or seven hours a day writing with them. No brand I've used can compete with Expo. They're simply the best.Several years ago, Expo released a new \\"low odor\\" marker that seems to be eclipsing the original. Apparently, some people were offended by the strong odor given off by Expo markers. There were also rumors that people were \\"huffing\\" the marker (which does nothing by the way). The odor is still strong, and the newer markers last a fraction of what the original does. Buy the original if you can find them. They're far superior. They also erase with less mess.I use black markers most of the time, and I try to only use original. They're simply the best dry erase marker on the market. I would suggest anyone who uses dry erase markers very much grab these markers while you can. I stocked up!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these girls","review":"I love these girls.

I tried a few dog foods, but CSDLS is reasonably priced and has quality main ingredients. The real convincer was noticing how firm and regular her potty breaks became. Not to be gross, but her poop just looked and felt(cause I clean up after my dog as everyone should) a lot better. She has a black coat and was pretty flaky before I started her on the food, but now it stays nice and shiny with no dogruff.And as for the recall that was issued, I was halfway through an 18 lb bag before I heard about it. I'm no vet, but dogs are pretty much immune to salmonella(think about it, most experts recommend raw bones for your dog) and the recall was more to do with human exposure risks than anything. No problems on the dogs end with the recalled food, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Dog","review":"After researching a number of dog foods, I chose this on because of its healthy ingredient list. It is packed with nourishment for dogs, and you feed a very small amount. As a result, it probably costs no more to feed than most popular brands such as purina and pedigree.

Dale examines the use of the Greek words \\"bapto\\" and \\"baptidzo\\". This is not a study of any biblical text but of how the word was used in Classic Greek. Dale will develope theological implications of the words and religious practice in subseuent volumes. This is a starting point. He shows there is no inherent religious association with the words as to their use or mode. No investigation on the subject of baptism is complete without this study. Be prepared, the book is full of sarcasm when arguments for the traditional definition of baptism (that it only means to dip or immerse) are pulled apart. The sarcasm is a little too thick at times but in most cases is quite humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the effort","review":"This book is not an easy read, but it will reward the diligent. Dale examines in detail what the Greek people meant when they used the word BAPTIZO. Those who have been taught that \\"baptize\\" means \\"immerse\\" will have their eyes opened. Note that Dale in this volume deals with pre-1st century literature. In his later books (JUDAIC BAPTISM, JOHANNIC BAPTISM, and CHRISTIC AND PATRISTIC BAPTISM) he deals with baptism as used in early Jewish and Christian literature, especially the OT and NT. What is particularly interesting is how Dale interacts with other writers on the subject, such as Alexander Carson.

Its a little hard to follow, it needs a workbook to go with it. its good if you have a ladies or men group but it's hard to read it alone.

At that point I felt the Holy Spirit and thought it was so coincidental for me to see her right at that moment, because I NEVER watch television and so on and so forth. So, I jumped on-line and pre-ordered the book. I struggled to somewhere in the 2nd chapter and then put it to the side. There was no God or Holy Spirit ministering in that book. I either threw it away or gave it away. The sound of God is very distinct and if it wasn't in the 1st 2 chapters I wasn't wasting my time trying to find him in the rest of it.

I thought while she was talking about washing she was going to start comparing it to Islam's process of ablution in which you must wash a certain way before each of your five prayers. I understand that it was symbolism, but the author makes it feel that you a praying in vain if you do not follow her exact steps. I always thought the point of being saved was to be able to come to God in a simple and childlike way.

Yes, one can learn a lot about primitive technologies and \\"lost\\" arts; but it is difficult to build a proper lathe by any means. Why make it any harder.There are much better plans for owner built lathes found in old engineering and industrial arts magazines etc. Do your homework and search these out.

Vernon Howard avoids an ego-pleasing, erudite, overly philosophical approach, instead offering an extremely practical guide: the beginning steps to self-enlightenment. Taking as a basis that we are all living in a kind of psychic sleep, he offers practical techniques to 'wake up'.For those who have already done a significant amount of spiritual reading, Howard's approach may seem 'populistic', but his dichotomy between the 'true self' and the 'false self' is misleadingly simple. In fact, he has distilled a very powerful thought system that is easy to understand for those who have little experience in spiritual matters but are looking for a better way of life, but that is also very much worth considering for those already well on their way."},{"rating":"1","title":"not especially helpful","review":"I found this book confusing.

Not thinking that the entire box would be this way; we kept the glasses. However, now after today the 6th and final glass (this was the first short one to break as the first 5 were the tall glasses) we have thrown them all away.

Unlike most products from other manufactures, this guy prohibits playing any files copied directly by dragging on Windows Explorer, and all music files are forced to be transferred with its badly designed SonicStage instead, which converts file format to one which other computers wouldn't read as part of Sony's anti-privacy policy at the expense of users' convenience that serves us no purpose. The software seems to not support UNICODE also, meaning it will not copy music files if their filename/tags are in multiple languages.When used as USB thumb drive, its file transfer rate is as slow as 2.5MB/s, pretty bad if you buy it for file storage function.As said by the name of product, it's Sony Music Player, never a MP3 Player.

Unlike every other USB hard drive with the Sony drive you can't simply drag and drop your existing MP3 and WMA music files to it. You must first load the Sony software, and then it goes through and converts all of you music files to Sony proprietary format. Now every time you want to add more music you need to download it then convert it. The software is not user friendly and converting file formats is simply a waste of time. I guess the Sony Music people got their hands a hold of this and wanted add protection for themselves and avoid losing licensing fees.

Since theirs won't run on my system I cannot use it at all. Supposedly, there is a Vista compatible version of SonicAnnoyance, but you have to download special drivers, plus the program, and after havign to fix the mess the disk that came with the player made of my system, I think I'll pass.I'm taking mine back, and getting an MP3 player I can copy songs directly to, without the sonicstupidity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slow Moving Target:The LST of World War II","review":"I bought this book for my Dad (a Navy Veteran in WWII-served on a LST).

You might actually hear a \\"poof\\" sound as the pressure escapes. Sometimes I do this twice. After that, it's good to go and I simply toss it in my bag with no worries of spillage.As some have mentioned, after drinking, sometimes there's a teeny teeny bit left in the space between the lip and the seal which could spill out.

Since it's all plastic, the double wall doesn't help much. Plastic isn't seeming to hold up the hot coffee nearly as long as my other steel based Contigo equivilant which keeps my coffee hot for over an hour. With this one, I'm very lucky if it keeps it hot for 20 minutes at the most.Not worth it. Go for a better Contigo not made of plastic like this.

I don't think this mug keeps the coffee that hot; mine leaked when I turned it upside-down; but the worst part of it all was that, because of the fact that it is called a \\"spill-proof mug,\\" the mug always stays closed. Some people might like that aspect. However, the downside is that you have to push the red button EVERY TIME (and keep it pressed every time) that you want to take a sip of coffee. And the button is not that easy to push. There is no locking mechanism to keep it open indefinitely. To me, it defeats the purpose of having coffee readily on hand to drink. It also makes it hard to hold the cup, because you have to hold it at the very top so you can push the button every time. If that doesn't bother you, then this should be an ok purchase.

I've been using it during super cold winter months (Jan. and Feb.) and it kept my coffee warm for about 2 hours. It would probably keep it warm/hot longer if I would use hot coffee, but I don't like boiling hot coffee so it perfect for me.

I didn't see it. The material is too dense for beginners, too scattered for the non-beginner.There are several places where the author states something absolutely intriguing and moves on in the next sentence. For example, after much discussion of handling probability, he states that Bayesian networks are probably the way to go. And that's all that was said, \\"Wait, wait\\" I wanted to shout. \\"Tell me more about why you believe that!\\" But alas that's all there is.Also, this book is probably too detailed for non-programmers, not detailed enough for programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing, poorly written","review":"This is one of the worst textbooks I have ever had to use.

It start giving details about parts of AI, then it stops. It covers to much material, and with not enough detail. It does list the references, so you can always go there and get more detail.If you have a decent background in calculus, then the mathematics in this book should not be that daunting. If you are a philosophy major trying to learn about AI, then you might find this book difficult.I really don't see much difference between this book and some of the other intro to AI books on the market.

True, most of these songs have not appeared on any of the other greatest-hits re-re-re-packagings that plague London's catalog.

I'm not really sure what the purpose of this book is. Almost every paragraph is referenced from somewhere else, leading me to wonder if the author ever had an original thought. The diagrams are either far too complex or convey no real meaning, and it seems like their only purpose is to illustrate the author's competency at using block diagramming software. The editing is poor: there are many misspelled words and rambling sentences. For example, the front cover misspells \\"angels,\\" referring to angel investors - look at the cover picture here.

Since Amazon gave me a great discount on it with another book I was considering getting, I went for it. In the end, I'm not dissappointed.The first 36 pages are info about Burma, and I must admit the color photographs are all excellent. The recipes call for a lot of ingredients that are hard to come by in the small town where I live (small enough that butter is sometimes hard to come by), but they also look great.

I only dissagree with Mrs. Ducommun on one point- she says to use 1x1 1/2 inch mesh for a cage. This is too big- a rat could get it's head stuck!

The lens is ruby tinted as per the item description. The clarity of the glass is decent, however, the image does have a very blue look. Now, mounting to the carry handle is where this product really lost my rating. My other carry handle scope fits like a glove. (Bushmaster 223 stock carry handle) This scope would not sit tight or flush regardless of tightness of the bolt/screw. The scope was easy to move around by hand once mounted.

Concise, readable, packed with useful material.","review":"This book ranks amongst the best I have come across in over 15 years of being a professional developer. It begins with a succinct anatomy of COM and continues to cover ATL in detail with outstanding clarity. Stepped samples show how to utilize the development environment to create ATL servers and clients. Combined with the samples are in-depth explanations of the ATL wizard generated code. The book covers much more than its title suggests. In addition to the obvious topics such as ActiveX controls and automation there are comprehensive sections on STL, DCOM security, ADO, OLE-DB, MTS and web scripting.

That's a very different thing from explaining the \\"whys\\". This means : if you don't have previous knowledge of COM, you will get a plain static picture of every component of COM, but you won't learn what the role of that component is inside your application, and what is the relation among these components. For example, the author describes the example programs line by line, but he fails to explain in detail the purpose of this lines and their implications for the rest of the program. Finally, the book is too superfitial, and it seems that the sole purpose of it is to generate profits not to teach the reader. I guess the other five-start-givers-readers had previous knowledge of COM or they just wanted to have an superfitial idea of ATL and COM. Of course, not my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistakes like this are unacceptable","review":"To be fair, I have not read the entire book.

To my surprise, Bates mentions in page 168 the following: \\"(Windows shares time slices between processes, not theads!)\\" (the exclamation mark is in the book). Call me weird, but mistakes like this really bother me. I begin to question the author's credibility and when this happens, I can't enjoy reading a technical book. I keep thinking that maybe something else I read is going to be horribly wrong and I don't like to have to question everything (too time consuming).

To develop perfect memory, the author teaches you to store and compress information in the form of unique images placed throughout a journey or stages. His reason being because it's much simpler to recall events, people, list of items and etc, when 2+ of your senses are involved and everything is converted into images instead of words and numbers. You have to practice the memory techniques in order to see improvements, so finishing this book is only half of the battle.As for me, the hardest part in the book deals with Dominic system, which is converting 0 - 99 into unique people and items for each number.

It seemed a bit daft. however it's the same people that did the 'Walking With...' and the 'Chased by...' series which I loved, so I gave it a go.They tread a very fine line between science fact and utter fantasy, but they do it with style and wit. The observation of the 'animals' in their habitats is very well done, imitating the style of wildlife documentaries to a tee. Then there is the boys-own-adventure element of trapping the beasts and keeping them, which surprisingly does tell us useful information about them and is also very entertaining.If you love Dinos then this is for you.

The dinosaurs are convincing, the stories have enough suspense to keep us watching, and there is even a bit of real wildlife biology thrown in for painless educational value. The show reminds me of a cross between Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom and Nature, with great dinosaurs and time travel thrown in for kid (and grown-up) appeal. The Time Portal is awesome, though my nine-year-old kept suggesting ways it could be improved to make it more efficient.

My wife and I are both professionals and typically let household chores get done on a desultory basis -- more often than not (I can admit) my better half picks up the slack. Finally, we agreed that it was ludicrous not to have a more organized household. The detailed, yet straight forward, quizzes provided in the book were extremely useful in dividing up responsibilities. Given the amount of time we spending planning our workdays, it is amazing how little time we devote to planning our homework. Dear Dinah helped us alleviate that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"I loved this book. Nothing is more important than household harmony. Take the time to read this with your mate and you will not be disappointed. A fun, warm and positive way to approach the equity of household duties. My husband and I broke through some long standing resentments and worked together to create a better, stronger, well oiled household machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of du du","review":"This movie could not have been worse. An entire movie and maybe 3 or 4 laughs the whole time. The romance story was absurd, the acting was awful, the story itself was ridiculous. The dancing... dancing? Well, I guess that is what they were doing, why couldn't they get some real break dancer to sit in for these no talent actors.Don't rent or ever buy this movie. It has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life (top 20 worst) and I grew up in the 80's. The references to everything 80's was amusing, but the movie was so obnoxious and stupid, that it detracted from it. A movie that could have been funny and good turned out to be such garbage.Better to be in a coma during the movie than actually watching this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few laughs, but mostly it was lame.","review":"Predictable plot, tired and repetitive jokes, it was so lame at points, but I predict this movie will become a cult classic in 20 years because it is so campy. We checked out some of the special features, like deleted scenes, man, they are so much worse than the movie that they are almost funnier than the movie because they suck so bad. The trailer for this movie was not bad, you could probably edit this movie down to a funny short film, but it just does not have enough good material for a feature film. Just watch the trailer for this movie, don't bother watching the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin it old skool","review":"The only thing I didnt like about this movie is it was widescreen I prefer fullscreen....but other then that the movie itself was 5 star..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST AND FAVORITE JAMIE KENNEDY MOVIE EVER!!!!","review":"ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS HILARIOUS MOVIE AND JAMIE KENNEDY IS AMAZING IN THIS MOVIE TOO!!!!!

Wetting the chest strap helps with conductivity of the chest strap.

I was delighted when I noticed the A3. I wanted a very simple HRM, and the A3 fit the bill. It has even more functions than I need. But I'm very pleased with how it works. Just set your age and it automatically calculates your target heart rate. I found that my perceived exertion exceeded my actual heart rate! Like other reviewers, the only change I would want for the Polar A3 is the battery -- I'd like to be able to change it myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the cheapest monitor....","review":"Overall this is better than the most basic monitor, but having used it a few times I think it is worth going for one with more features.

Also, I would have liked to have seen smaller but more pictures and information regarding names of the jewelry, years sold, and available pieces in the sets.

This book was purchased for dating and naming information. Which it does not have. It has nothing but pictures (well, okay, a COUPLE of items have date references and names). The book wasn't cheap and the information I was searching for was not there. I actually noticed in one place where the item pictured was NOT the name referenced. Someone who is really in the know needs to write a book with ALL the information pertaining to the Sarah Coventry Jewelry items.

We thought it would be a good way to start watching the entire 4 Seasons of the Hetty Wainthropp TV series, which I had also purchased at Christmas time. So, we watched the show and when it was over we kind of looked at each other and agreed, that was kind of weird. The story was a bit depressing and just not very satisfying. That being said we started into the Wainthropp Series (2 seasons so far) and it is developing into an interesting show. It is obvious that story telling in the UK differs from Hollywood in surprising ways. The typical MO of a Hollywood plot line are pleasantly avoided with this series. Each show is unique in its own way.Anyway, the price for Missing Persons was so good, it doesn't really matter that it is not that enjoyable. At least we have seen everything that is a available. Who knows maybe you will like it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyable but","review":"The production is rough around the edges.

I can see why she was so reluctant for everything to happen. It was almost like he woke up one day and realized I know nothing about this woman but I know she's beautiful so I must learn more and then they are married. There was some slight seduction which was written well. It pulled you in a bit and while I did get angry with the characters I liked them too.

Don't purchase these prepaid points cards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Overpriced","review":"I wanted to play a few online arcade games, and the selection is nice (Sonic, Sonic 2, Street Fighter 2, etc); however, for 20 dollars, this card only gave me enough points to cover 1.5 times the price of 1 of those games. This is bull honky, and for 20 bucks, I expect more than 1 outdated video game.If Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo would open up their eyes and realize that the only reason people turn to emulation and ROMs (which I'm sad to say that I have, at times) is because they really try to stick it to the consumer--price-wise--on games the consumer has already bought on prior technology. If these retro-games were available for something like $2.00 each, I would buy a ton of them. Until then, compilation discs are still a better bet for your buck. I would suggest Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection instead, found here:http://www.amazon.com/Sonics-Ultimate-Genesis-Collection-Xbox-360/dp/B001G3AZS2/"},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"Rip off.

I feel so much safer with this purchase option over giving Xbox Live our credit card info, and it's also a lot more convenient & faster than driving to an electronics store to buy a download card.Also, just to touch on the insights of those unhappy with the price-per-point value: I'm absolutely with you in feeling ripped off, but unfortunately that's not a price set by Amazon, that's a Microsoft problem.

This is especially true if you buy the digital code. Not only is it instant, but you also avoid the added cost of taxes, which can add almost $4 extra to your card's price. It's also cheaper than buying it in stores that typically sell for $49.99, not including tax. The 4000 points card is also a better value than the 1600 points card, if you look in the long run. The 1600 point card gets you ~82 points per dollar spent, whereas the 4000 points card gets you ~86 points per dollar spent.Overall, if you're willing to spend the $25 extra, buy the 4000 points card through Amazon and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift!","review":"Bought this as present for Christmas!

All I can say is that as of now, it is working, working well, and working immediately online.Also, as other reviewers have remarked, going this way keeps your credit card out of the hands of Microsoft.

With that said, I'd much rather buy MS points/Xbox Live subscription codes online; cuts down on the packaging with having it leave the warehouse and the fuel to arrive at my mailbox a few days later, and it's normally cheaper than buying the points directly from Microsoft.

That's not a bad thing because we really like it, but it is just different from the Wiggles other videos. Greg has a nice voice for country music too and I think he's realized that since he has released a regular country album.Anyway, this video was done as if they're in their Wiggly World (the Wiggles shows on Playhouse Disney), complete with the bumble bee in the beginning. They do a song on an animated train that is worth the cost of the video itself. It is just adorable!

However, I don't think you can ever go wrong with the Wiggles, so I would still recommend this video. If you are just getting into Wiggles, the best videos are Wiggle Time, Toot Toot and Yummy Yummy.

They enlist the help of several Austrailian and New Zealand song writers and performers for several of their songs. They manage to make all the songs lively and catchy with the exception of poor Tim Finn who really missed the boat on children's music revisiting his 80's hit Six Months is A Leaky Boat with a slow tempo and phrases like \\"the tyranny of distance\\", but he tried. I still get his song stuck in my head and our beloved boys brought out some of the best choreography for that song to liven it up. I probably didn't make any friends with that opinion, but it just is not a children's song!I wasn't sure about the video at first, but the choreography in all the songs is very good and it really gets better each time I watch it. My 19 month old really likes it. Not as good as 'Toot Toot' but mutch better than 'Wiggly Gremlins'. Which kinda stinks. No offense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Colorful, and Entertaining!","review":"This is the first Wiggles video I've bought for our one year old daughter. I love the majority of the songs and she loves to dance to most of them. She usually won't watch anything but Baby Einstein, so it says quite a bit if she enjoys the video. I like the songs, but I don't feel they are as good as their earlier songs (e.g. Yummy Yummy). Overall, it's a great video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the rest!!","review":"...My sons and I were dissapointed - this video is not as lively or engaging.

Taba Naba is especially nice, if you have to listen to the same video over and over, like we do here. I also enjoy Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport and Six Months in a Leaky Boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids LOVE it!","review":"This video is lots of fun, with some upbeat new songs that are fun to dance to, featuring people like Rolf Harris and his \\"Tie me Kangaroo down, sport\\" and Christine Anu with \\"Taba Naba\\". These are songs even my husband and I can sing along to (but don't tell anyone). My kids pick this one more often than most any of their other Wiggles videos. It doesn't have any of the \\"classic\\" Wiggles songs, like \\"hot potato\\" or \\"fruit salad\\"...but it has plenty of fun, colorful music. It has little of the magic acts, or other \\"fillers\\", but is instead just one song after another. But that is what my kids love about it. Usually they lose interest in the magic shows or Anthony's workshop, etc. It's the Music that keeps them interested, and this DVD delivers! A good Wiggles buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, slow, slow","review":"Other reviewers have said this is the best Wiggles video! It's the only one we own, so I can't compare; but, if this is the best, then I'm certainly not buying any more.The TV show is upbeat and fun. This video is not. The songs on the video get progressively slower and duller. Is the object to put children to sleep?After the first three songs, each number just drags and is far from being a catchy tune. My 14 month old loves the TV show, but this gets old with him very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste The Money","review":"I have a 2 year old that loves the Wiggles, but this video does nothing for her. She is bored to death with the drab, lifeless songs. Almost every song is sung by a \\"special guest\\" and they're all Australian singers singing Australian folk songs. This video doesn't have the usual upbeat songs and dances that my daughter originally fell in love with on their 'Toot Toot' video."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Guys are Great!!","review":"I can't say enough great things about these four (4) guys from \\"Down Under\\" and their friends.

This was the first videotape we purchased of the Wiggles (my son picked it out himself...it was obviously the most colorful). None of the songs featured on this tape are ever sang on the show and feature several Australian artists that are unknown in America. We then bought \\"Toot Toot\\" and \\"Yummy Yummy\\" and both those tapes worked much better with my son. These tapes feature more of the songs from the Disney show and the tapes are more in that vein...silly and fun, whereas \\"Wiggly Wiggly World\\" lumbers along at a snail's pace. I'd give \\"Toot Toot\\" and \\"Yummy Yummy\\" five stars and make \\"Wiggly Wiggly World\\" the last Wiggles tape in your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"My children LOVE previous Wiggles videos, because the songs were so simple that toddlers and preschoolers could sing and dance along. But this overly slick video does not inpsire participation, at all. The dances are way too complicated, the flashy graphics distracting, and the additional characters irritating (especially the choreographer who now features herself prominantly as a character). The 4 Wiggles have previously shown themselves to be brilliant in their simplicity. I wish they would get back to their original style."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wiggles are Colorful Boys.","review":"Wiggles World is a magic place in the music video movie. Greg, Murray, Jeff and Anthony are four colorful boys who love to make me smile, laugh and best of all...interact with them.One of my favorite songs in (Wiggly, Wiggly World) is \\"In The Wiggles World\\", \\"Here Come The Wiggles\\" and \\"Sing With Me\\" which features Kamal. But my most favorite song of all is, \\"One Little Cyote\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with International Songs","review":"This DVD has lots of songs with international singers, which i really like because some of them are in different languages.

The fact that all of the black male characters in this book were either in a gang and not even one was portrayed in a good light made this book hard for me to read. Even the main character, Tracy Shephard, did not really have a fully developed character. I didn't develop a closeness with the main character, and this left me with no particular feeling about any of the characters in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was not a good read!","review":"If I was you I would checked this out at your locallibrary.This was not worth money.

The author was definitley trying to make the story reflect the title in every way. Eventually you just get to the point where you are like \\"Are u serious.\\" Plenty of people die, plenty ofbaby mamma drama, and police stuff, but that did not help the book. Instead it made things worse because Hines did not take time to develop the characters instead she jumped with the plot.Rarley do I have a tough time getting through an urban fiction novel, but in this case it was a difficult task. The end was definitley a surprise, but it didn't really make any sense. The author didn't really explain the situation with Mekhai and we have no idea how Destiny knew all along. I still don't understand that part. Save your money on this book, it is predictable, hard to follow and not very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Drama just kept coming!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"There was definietly drama in this novel. I thought it was fantastic, I would definitely recommend this book to someone else. The ending was a little difficult for me to follow at first, because the author didn't really explain the situation with Destiny and Mekhai and as a reader of many urban fiction books I would have liked for her to include how Mekhai explained to Destiny what he had done to her mother.

I usually favor books by what the reviews read,afterall we depend on others to determine if we should buy, rent or borrow.

I've had other good books waiting to be read, but i wanted to finish what i started.Yes, it had it good times but mostly it was just an boring read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good songs, including some hard-to-find","review":"My family has had this book since I was a child. I didn't appreciate it much until recently, when I began to look for children's songbooks for my own children. It has fewer common songs than most songbooks, such as Singing Bee; so it would be best for someone looking for hard-to-find songs or singing games. (It includes a section for singing games, with good descriptions of the actions for the children--mostly circle games, such as The Farmer In the Dell.)The illustrations are very stylized. Most songs include a sentence or two describing their origins.Some of its hard-to-find songs that I appreciate include: Frog Went A-Courtin', Aiken Drum, Michael Finnegan, If All the Raindrops, Ain't It Great to be Crazy?, The Animal Fair, and Kookaburra.It's sections are:Good Morning and Good Night (18)Birds and Beasts (20)Nursery Songs (21)Silly Songs (20)Singing Games and Rounds (26)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Dress","review":"I bought the medium size.

I won't bother discussing any of the text, since there are plenty of reviews anywhere, so this is just geared towards the NASB on my Kindle.The major worry I had was navigation. There is a main table of contents, which is a selectable list of books. When you choose the book you to which you want to want to jump, a sub-TOC appears, with the chapters of that book. Just select your chapter and you are there. On the not-so-positive side, typing \\"book chapter:verse\\" does not appear to work, but that's fairly minor.It would be nice if there was an eventual edition with a built-in concordance, but I might be stretching my wish-list with that last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The version is great, the format SUCKS!","review":"This is my first e-bible and I am severely disappointed.

In this I reviewed my good experience with the Kindle version of the 'Amplified Bible'.I am also impressed with the Kindle version of the 'New American Standard Bible'.I found that the Kindle version is very simple and straight forward to use, and easy to find your way around in it. Selecting a book of the Bible and a chapter of that book is very easy.The Kindle version of the 'New American Standard Bible' is based on a 'readers' version, that is, it is not the centre margin version. Consequently you will not find that additional reference material in this Kindle version.If you want that additional information, then the Kindle 'Amplified Bible' is the way to go.Still, the Kindle 'New American Standard Bible' is an excellent way to go if your requirement is simply 'to read the Bible'. For this purpose, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY small print","review":"Before ordering this BIBLE I took a look inside.

You get a combination of a well-made hardback book, with a font size that is large enough to actually read, and the most accurate English translation of the Bible there is (NASB)--- all in one. It's quality; it's readable; it's Scripture. On top of all that, the price is good. When it comes to Bible translations, the NASB is simply the best there is. It is an accurate, word-for-word translation. Most of today's English versions of the Bible are not actually translations; they are paraphrases. They are full of the ideas and opinions of the men and women who participated in the project. The translation committees determined beforehand that they were not interested in word-for-word accuracy, but in thought-for-thought opinions --- and that is what you get. When I read Scripture, I want to know what it actually says, not someone's opinion of what it should say. Get the NASB and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"For being so violent, you would expect it to at least be interesting","review":"Usually violent books filled with sex (including rape, incest, and incestual rape) and gore are entertaining at least. But this one manages to be crude and disgusting while at the same time being excruciatingly boring and difficult to follow! It meanders from topic to topic with little consistency, and contradicts itself multiple times. It's like the author didn't even read the preceding parts! Also, there are terrible plot holes, even in the first couple chapters. There is a couple (one man and one woman) who are supposed to be the only people on earth, and they have two sons. Both sons find wives. Oops! Guess the author didn't think that one through very well... Some people swear by this story, but I really can't see the draw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindle version review","review":"Navigating the Kindle version of this book is ok, but not great.

I liked everything about it except for the fact that I am forced into a license agreement to use software that I do not want to install on my pc and the fact I can not play mp3's but have to convert then using lame software. What were you thinking!? furthermore it is very frustrating to use this software and arrange my music files. It should be drag and drop! That simple. You took a great product and totally foobared it by forcing people to convert their mp3's. Time is money and you have already cost me more money than what your product is worth so I am returning it to get a real mp3 player.

At least Apple's \\"pride\\" can be unlocked with a bit of trying and I can add music through iTunes - which after trying out SonicStage seems like a breath of fresh air...There must be some better mp3 players out there.

So, if you already have files, and you want to load them onto the player, you will have to convert them with sonicstage first, then transfer them on. This is very inconvenient, and will take up double the space on your hard drive.If you don't already have mp3's or wma's, or if you are already using sonicstage, this is a good player.

Sony's software doesn't put in a \\"soft blank\\" where one track ends and another begins, as does Windows Media software, even when you reduce cross-fading. When you're running or working out, I want my music constant, seamless, as it was intended to be heard.Another reason I like this product is the long battery life. It seems as if I have to recharge the Sansa every two days.

The focus is placed on using Game Theory for developing successful strategies for businesses, excluding its mathematical aspects.The whole book is so well-written, that most readers are barely aware of how deeply it is grounded in co-operative game theory.It is full of real-world case studies, which further enhance its readability.However, a star is deducted for a rather \\"quick\\" conclusion of the theory (and the book itself), which actually pays little favour to the \\"S\\" (Scope) parameter of the PARTS theory presented.Also, frequently the reader gets the feeling that this is a book which presents case-studies and upon them builds a theory, although the opposite might have been more appropriate.In any case, this is a book worth considering if you wish to examine how Game Theory might influence your business strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Grandchild Loves It","review":"One of Barney's best (according to my granddaughter).

TRUE holding therapy is NOT holding a struggling child down while he or she screams in rage. Holding therapy is very gentle, where a child is held lovingly like an infant is. Mother and child make eye contact and mother sings or tells child stories. I have seen holding therapy and when a child is healing, it is a beautiful, powerful thing to all involved. Further more, although Nancy Thomas' techniques for parenting and therapy are non-traditional it is done with the child's safety as priority. Until you live it or work with it, you will never understand it. Do more research. Nancy Thomas may not be a scholar writer but she knows what she is talking about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lived with RAD","review":"This book was sadly wonderful.

The horrible acting, or simply lack of it, in first 30 seconds of the film was a sure sign that I had just wasted my money. The \\"acting\\" by ALL the actors in the movie wasn't any better. As for the tango scenes in the movie, there wasn't any traditional Argentine Tango whatsoever, and the nuevo or show tango wasn't very good.

Now I have two cartridges for it left and Brother has seen fit to update its product line to a new model HL-2040 which is an updated 1450 except, of course, it doesn't use the same cartridges; ughh!!! Thanks Brother; you get a \\"Got you\\" on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Lifespan","review":"The printer is not very old, 1-2 years or so, but has the grey matting that many others seems to have found. Not through the first toner cartridge yet. A new drum and toner would cost as much as a new printer so I won't be taking that route. Very dissappointed. Would have rated 4-5 stars before this fault, but I now feel like I have been robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this printer","review":"Wish I could give 0 stars... Don't buy this printer. Poor print quality after about 200 pages. Cleaning the corona wire helps but only temporarily. Printing 10-20 blank pages helps but only temporarily. ... Just a lousy printer with no support. ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best monochrome laser printer","review":"It works great and performed flawlessly..one minor complain, it draws a lot of power when it powered up. Other than that, great value..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short of your expectations","review":"This series is over rated. For the price I expected more than it delivered. We own a real estate office, have 5-6 laser printers ... Was looking for dependable individual printer. Found this one to constantly jam, when you have to hand fed the printer. Only prints envelopes one at a time, and invariably jams on the 4th or 5th envelope. May be good for someone who justs prints simple letters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toner smearing and bad service","review":"The 1450 I purchased seems sturdy enough and basicly works well except for the print quality. The background of the printed page is smeared with excess toner! Forget about calling tech support! I had to carry on a conversation via e-mail and it would take up to a week for each reply. After all this nonsense I was basicly told to replace the toner cartridge, and if that didn't work, replace the drum unit. All this, of course, was to be at my own expense! Brother only warrenties these items for 90 days. If you get one of these printers be sure to pound the snot out of it or you may have a warrenty problem when you discover a defective toner cartridge.I should have gotten the Lexmark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Disappointed small business owner","review":"Worked well for one year. Then it started to jam several times a day. Brother support responded quickly but their suggestions didn't help. Then told me to get it serviced..certainly not worth the cost these days. Would not recommend this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print quality problem","review":"I was very happy with this printer for the first year of operation. After that on each printed sheet the paper was covered with a light gray tint (dusted with toner). I replaced both the toner and the drum. No solution to the problem. Given that others here have complained of the same problem, I think there is a quality problem with this printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly first-rate curriculum supplement","review":"Researched and created by teachers Stephen Krulik and Jesse A. Rudnick, Teaching Middle School Mathematics: Activities, Materials, And Problems is an extensive, \\"classroom friendly\\" resource of sample problems, worksheets, exercises and more for teaching middle school students about everything from fractions and magic squares, to basic geometry and algebra, to networks with odd and even vertices, and a great deal more. Reproducible pages and carefully explained directions for the activities make Teaching Middle School Mathematics a truly first-rate curriculum supplement for tenured and substitute teachers, and would prove an invaluable resource for dedicated homeschool instruction as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Multi","review":"This is one of the best liquid multi-vitamins I have been able to find. It has more Vitamin C than most and absorbs really well. Surprisingly, my daughter loves the mango flavor so she has been using it also and it has really worked well for us. The only negative on this is most online retailers seem to be out of stock a lot on this item. There are only a few retail stores that carry it and they price it significantly higher than the online prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entitled, angry author","review":"I'm shocked that a publisher would publish this book. The way the author writes about the Chinese is horrifying--calling them monsters, accusing them of terrible things. The reason for her anger is unclear--it seems she blames the entire Chinese population for the fact that her little girls are available for adoption.Laskas' second daughter is a bit quiet and withdrawn at first--and Laskas seems to consider rejecting the child! And yet she dares to criticize the girl's birthmother! Unbelievable.This book is the work of a very angry, entitled person. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coaxial Staple","review":"This item is labeled as Coaxial Staple which leads one to believe that it could be used for standard coaxial cable (quad or R6) such as for TV. I don't know what cable it is supposed to be for, but it's too small for coaxial cable. It is big enough for phone cord or maybe speaker wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Time With Bruce Hornsby in NYC","review":"Bruce Hornsby and his band perform in three very different venues in the Big Apple and this is a behind-the-scenes look at each performance.

I have watched this numerous times and I continue to love this. Great purchase!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"IMO if you like Bruce you will like this. Nothing exceptional, no chances taken, just a couple of hours with Bruce. The band meshed nicely, the only stand out being the drummer, other than Bruce. The sound mix was average, the video good. It's enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Nights of Excellence!","review":"This DVD rocks!Bruce and the Noisemakers have set the standard for serious listeners and serious musicians alike.Beginning with a interview-like approach, the viewer travels with Bruce to the NY Blue Note. Very candid conversations, play, and performance.Then, a stunning performance at NY Town Hall that will get you out of your seat just watching Bruce and the Noisemakers do their thing. Great improv, spontaneous remarks and play that are nearly as good as being there in person. The interaction between Bruce and the band is tremendous, with every talented member flowing in sync with Bruce.This DVD gives the viewer the experience of watching and hearing a musical journey that at times is sailing along smoothly, and at others is like a wild ride down Thunder Road! But oh so together!This video is a must for anyone who enjoys music, be it rock, jazz, blues, or pop, and particularly for musicians of any level.High marks for one of the best music videos I have seen period!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romance!","review":"When Tanner Davenport flew his Cessna from Alaska and had to do an emergency landing in McKay land he was not ready for Charity McKay to be so... Charity! He has been gone for seven years but he could remember that fiery red hair anywhere. He thought his younger brother needed rescuing and that's what he came to do. Kentucky brought back a lot of memories, good and bad ones, but he couldn't fight the new sparks flying everywhere when Charity was around. He knew he couldn't stay and Charity's life was here at the ranch. Her life was horses and his the airplanes. But a common goal might help them to fight the attraction between them rescuing their families from making a life altering mistake. Dianne's stories once again tug at the fibers of the heart. A story about loyalties and friendship, coming together to turn into a fun sexy romance. This is a great story about love and ties that bound the hearts of a family and friends together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but beware!","review":"Most of the pre-drilled holes DO NOT MATCH UP.

The one gripe that I have is that the design is a bit too shallow for older televisions. There is only 18\\" of depth for your television, make that 17 3/4\\" when you use the lower latch on the door. I had to do some quick cutting on the rear plywood boards so that the backside of my television could sit inside with the doors closed.

Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Modernization, Horrible Translation","review":"This translation of Aristophanes takes many liberties with the Greek. The translator has a knack for adding profanity wherever he sees fit. This gets in the way of the humor, and makes Aristophanes' admittedly crude humor much cruder than necessary. Furthermore, there are random lines that the translator adds, including one in The Suits that seems as if he is just trying to slip in his own political views among those of the poets. Significant lines have also been removed or altered beyond recognition. Though this translator does make an honest attempt at modernizing the puns and jokes used in the play, he fails utterly at maintaining the original meaning and vibe of the poetry.In a nutshell, there are much better translations of Aristophanes out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Local Dialect Detracts from the Plays","review":"Paul Roche, attempting to give his plays a more \\"familiar\\" feel to an English-speaking audience goes too far.He has the irritating habit of occasionally flavoring the words of a minor character in such a way that they sound more like an English country bumpkin than the character they are supposed to represent.As an example, near the beginning of The Acharnians, Roche does the following; pay close attention to the Crier:AMPHITHEUS: Have the speeches begun?CRIER: 'oo wishes to speak?AMPHITHEUS: I do.CRIER: 'oo are you?AMPHITHEUS: AmphitheusCRIER: That don't sound like a 'uman being.This is but a single example. If you prefer a feeling of authenticity in your ancient Greek drama, stay away from Paul Roche."},{"rating":"1","title":"To religiously focused","review":"I tried to read this book, but the constant references to the \\"christian male\\" made it difficult to feel as if it was pertinent. I feel this book should be specifically shown to be a book for someone with christian beliefs, because it is useless for those of us with other spiritual paths."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware non-christians!","review":"I returned this book, a first for me with Amazon. I would have given the book 0 stars but that is not an option in the ratings program. The data base for this 'research' is christian males. This is not a book that most of us can relate to. The book doesn't unmask anything except christian males are depressed. The book information needs to say up front that it is all about people who center their lives around the church.

I have these zero-clearance inserts for both saws. After cutting through it with the saw, the Delta has problems as it doesn't seem to have enough HP to handle the friction between the blade and the insert. No problem on the Jet saw. This situation will correct itself in time as the blade wears on the zero-clearance insert in use. For performance in keeping things from falling between the blade and the insert, and for preventing chipout, it works great. I haven't tried using one with a Dado blade, and may not do so, since with changes in dado width, you would need many inserts to keep it zero-clearance at all widths. If this becomes an issue, I'll make my own inserts out of MDF and not buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Was way too large and the side flaps awkwardly button way too low on the main part of the hat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst hat ever...","review":"Packed too folded up, can't make it to look right!

The cover is about all this book has going for it. Didn't even make it half way thru the book, much less on to the 3 of the series and the following trilogy. This book has a lot of detail that I like, but the constant jumping POV just destroys any sympathy or understanding you build for the characters. It comes unannounced and sometimes after just a sentence or 2, sometimes after a couple of pages. The author put a lot of work into building his world, but really had no idea what to do with the population. Maybe the next series, but unless I read some really good reviews, I won't be reading anymore of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring","review":"I agree with the reviewers who said the pace was too slow. It took me forever to finish because I kept putting it down and doing something else. A book this long needs more than one task that the characters have to complete. Following after kidnappers for hundreds of pages - boring, boring, boring. I wanted to see how it ended, so I skipped here and there for the last 200 or so pages.

I guess my biggest gripe was about Leith and his feelings of inadequacy. Beating us over the head with it over and over got old quick.

This world is incredibly well-developed as far as geography and history is concerned. It's the work of years. However, the story itself is lacking not the point of non-existence. There is a plot, but it is little more than a device that allows cardboard cut-out characters to wander Mr. Kirkpatrick's extremely well-realized world. For some, that may be enough, but for me, not so much. The prose is outstanding when it comes to describing features of the world. It falls flat when it calls for dialogue or when characters interact with one another. As a result, the book fails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we there yet?","review":"When I was younger and naive I had a rule that I would always finish any book I started no matter how bad the book. Now that I am older and hopefully wiser I have decided that life is too short to waste finishing a book you don't enjoy. This is one of those books. OMG is this book boring. Let me summarize the book for you. \\"Today we got up and headed east. We saw trees, mountains and rivers. We camped outside. It snowed.\\" Now repeat that for 600 pages. If you are in to detailed descriptions of mythical scenery then this is the book for you. The characters are uni-dimensional and unsympathetic. There is nothing new, original or innovative in this story. It is a thoroughly average fantasy quest novel. I finished two other books while struggling to get through page 299 of this sleeper. I give up. Life is too short and there are too many good books to read. Needless to say I'm going to pass on the next two installments in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ideas, just not executed well","review":"While the story is the typical 'group of wanna-be heroes goes on a quest to save the world' the author has built a very believable world (seemingly set in Europe in the far future? <shrug>) and I really wanted to become immersed in it. The problem is that he cannot tell a compelling story! I felt no connection to any of the characters and the action sequences were laid out almost matter-of-factly. And it's too bad because the setting is remarkable and deserves to be inhabited by people to match it. The story never grabbed me and while it can be argued that the book is setting the stage for the next two the plot isn't all that complex and needs dynamic story telling to bring the whole thing off. 2 stars for the world and history, I won't be reading the other books of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Across the Face of the World","review":"This is beyond a doubt the worst book I have ever read.

I wanted to like this book. I just can't like this book, nor can I finish it. I have reached about 300 pages so far and I have just thrown in the towel today. I can reiterate what a previous reviewer wrote about this book: Woke up, walk, walk, walk, freezing, snow, mountains, a paragraph to describe a stream, camp for the night, wake up, repeat for another 100 pages.One word - BORINGThe only reason I gave it two stars is the author does have writing talent and paints detailed, descriptive pictures of the scenery. Now If I was reading an atlas, this would be superb, but I'm not .. enough said.Skip it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulous Cover Art","review":"The books of this series have the most breathtaking cover art. The simple but stunning image was a big factor in my decision to buy this book. Alas, do not judge a book by its cover!The author has a couple of decent characters but he seems unable to focus on them. His pacing is leaden. He spends pages describing the landscape in passive, adjective-laden prose. Unable to move his plot along dramatically, the author focuses on small details of setting until I felt I was reading a travelogue. Worst of all, some of his details about horses and winter travel were wrong. Had I been swept up in an action fantasy worthy of Tolkien, I wouldn't have noticed. This is a book that cries out for editing.Unlike sleeping pills, this book has no side effects as it sends you to sleep. In that sense, I can recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate lack of plot, character development and image building","review":"First I would like to echo a few others and congratulate Peter Cotton and Steve Stone for a well designed and illustrated cover. The book was an impulse buy based on the cover and Trudi Canavan's \\"Not since Tolkien have I been so awed\\". I am sorely disappointed with her.This book has failed in several ways as other reviewers have pointed out already. Personally, the lack of character development and backstory, a hashed together plot, and dialogue that is stilted made the book very difficult to read.I am very glad that I didn't purchase the entire series at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stories of the heart","review":"In Gilb's latest novel it is good to see that he has retained his ability to tell stories of everyday working people and give them a wider audience. I really enjoy his simple style and obsevations of a lifestyle which has many trying moments. He has a very good sense of humor and his characters are real and easy to understand. I enjoyed magig of blood and I welcome this latest effort. Good going.I would like to know where he will be on tour, so I can hear him in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sexy Volume","review":"Dagoberto Gilb is too sexy and handsome and the book's drawings are very sexy as well. I bought the book several months ago and when I got home I didn't read it. I thoght I bought it as an impulse buy, because wanted to have him sign it to me at a lecture he gave. Now that I read it I'm only disappointed that there aren't more stories and it all had to end. I have been reading Latinas almost exclusively before, and as much as I love my comadres, this one is by far my favorite (joking, he says he is a Chicana writer) and I, like Columbus, feel like I've discovered a new writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indelible","review":"I recently had the pleasure of meeting Davy Rothbart, who generously took time away from an active travel and business schedule at my request. During our meeting, Davy proved not only to be charismatic and artful, but I learned that his eloquence transferred to his work. I am familiar with Found Magazine, and so I had no doubt that his contributions to This American Life would be laugh-out-loud funny. And they were. But what I didn't expect was how profoundly meaningful they would be and the poignancy with which he told them.In his first story, Mr. Rogers and Me, Davy said of Fred Rogers: \\"I've never been around someone who is both so vulnerable and so fearless about showing you who he is.\\" This quote stands out in my mind because it describes precisely how I felt about Davy as I listened to this CD.Davy is talented and entertaining, and I enthusiastically recommend this CD, as well as his entire catalog of magazines, books, and film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Ok Price","review":"This book has lots of good information about the dog breed.

Didn't really provide me with any knowledge I didn't already obtain from looking on the internet for about 30 mins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast, quiet, great price!","review":"I have owned this printer about 2 months now, and could not be happier. It is silent when not in operation, warm-up is only 2-3 seconds, and a single sheet pops out in seconds. Have done print jobs as large as 300 pages or so, and the printer really does crank them at 10-12 pages/minute. Print quality is excellent. Mac OS 10.1 works great with the printer; kudos to Brother for staying up-to-date. Don't know about long-term durability, but seems solid enough. The Fax works fine. Can't go wrong at this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps going and going....","review":"What a major improvement after switching from my HP OfficeJet piece of junk! I realize this is an apples to oranges comparison, but I was ready to throw that HP in the street and run it over. I've been using this machine for nearly 8 months. It is a true workhorse and I am very pleased with performance. Faxes, copies and prints very quickly. Scanning feature is pretty good, too. Help via email was ok, but not stellar. My only reason for giving this machine 4 stars and not 5 is that I have a hard time believing I'm really getting 6000 pages with its larger toner drum. Then again, some of the stuff I print and copy is hardly standard text. Overall--a great performing machine and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again...","review":"I've had this boat anchor of a multifunction printer for a year, and I'm getting rid of it. I've owned HPs and IBMs before and they've never cost me in supplies what this thing has. See the drum listed in supplies? You're gonna need one about every 2nd or 3rd toner cartridge. That's right, boys and girls, this slug is gonna cost you it's suggested retail price in toner and drums every few thousand sheets. And, amazingly, even with replacing the drum, which seems to last the life of the machine on other units from HP or IBM, the print quality STILL never returns to \\"like new\\". Buyer beware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy untill the software is updated","review":"I cannot scan. I called technical support and I was told that I need to reinstall window XP professional. The problem was not fixed. I am still under warranty and I do not knwo if brother will take the machine back.

You may be able to print if you're lucky, but the scanner and the manual feed aren't supported according to the Brother website (a page that's impossible to find). The worst part of my experienec so far is Brother's technical support for the Mac. If you try to reach them by phone, they'll actually ask you to FAX your question to their Mac expert who can ONLY be contacted by written fax (no email address, no telephone number). Just a customer service nightmare. I wish I could return this, but I'm stuck now. Get the HP multifunction instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Real problems with XP","review":"As reported by other reviewers, my 8500 worked well with Windows 98, but I've had nothing but problems making it work using a new computer with Windows XP. Most of the time neither the native printer driver on the installation CD nor the one downloaded from the Brother web site work. I never got the inbox XP driver to work. After numerous installation attempts, I gave up and am using an older, but much more reliable Canon inkjet. Unless Brother gets a trouble-free set of XP drivers out to users, they shouldn't advertise this product as XP-compatible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agony for Windows XP users","review":"This is my second Brother MFC. I was reasonably happy with it when I was using windows 98. But I recently bought a new computer with windows XP, and trying to get this thing to work properly with XP has been a nightmare. After hours of download tutorials and uninstalling and reinstalling drivers from the Brother web site, it still does not work properly. Under no circumstances should you put the driver CD that comes with the unit in your CD drive if you are using XP. Beware also: The \\"updated\\" printer + scanner drive on the Brother web site does not work properly. A separate printer-only driver does work, but then you don't have all of the fancy scanning and character recognition stuff.For those who are still using windows 98, this is probably a reasonbly good unit if you want a combined laser printer/scanner/fax machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Support for 2003","review":"I am generally happy with the quality of printing, faxing, and copying, however scanning does not work. I run Windows Server 2003 and there simply are no drivers for it (nor, as far as I can tell, intention to create drivers)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must have gotten a good one","review":"I've had my Brother MFC-8500 for over 3 years now (I bought a 3 year service plan, but never have had to use it) and haven't had even one problem with it. I have a small, one room home office and it fits the bill nicely. I had Windows 98 when I purchased it, then I upgraded to XP Professional, called Brother and they sent me a CD for XP and I upgraded the software so it would operate on XP. The TN-460 High Yield cartridge is great--gives you a lot of ink for the money and the cost is very reasonable. The only thing the specs for this product don't tell you is that you have to buy a new drum unit every so often (I've bought 2 in the past 3 years) and they are about $150 at Staples. Now I'm not that printer savvy, so I don't know if other brands need drum unit changes like this one. But all in all, I couldn't be happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"A wonderful new look at a classic.

I'm certainly looking forward to more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I had seen the episodes already on the BBC when they aired originally, but it was great to see what had been cut.

What I'm going to focus on is the release itself. True fans, this is just the \\"vanilla\\" pack. Notice that there are no extras, no commentaries, and it doesn't even include the 2010 Christmas special. Granted, it's dirt cheap, but you get what you pay for.I for one will wait until they release the entire set, all 14 episodes, with the Confidentials, the episode prequels, the commentaries, and all the other goodies. Frankly, if you don't get those, then why should you pay for something you could just as easily torrent?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst quality I've ever seen in a DVD.","review":"There is 3 hours on a DVD here, so the result is a horribly pixellated picture, which is odd, as typically the DVDs of other seasons were stellar.

Everytime the Doctor regenerates or finds a new companion I don't think I'll like them but I always end up LOVING them! I think the storylines this season are a lot more complex (and confusing) than previous seasons and when I re-watch I always catch something I missed. Great show, great actors. I love my Doctor. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Doctor Who Ever!","review":"I've pushed the memory of most of the first Part of Series 6 out of my mind. Unfortunately I do remember it was unfathomable and incomprehensible, the writing was purposely confusing in an attempt to intrigue the viewer and be mysterious but it ends up being nonsensical and even worst boring...even the actors seemed bored by it. It's just the worse don't say I didn't warn you.HOWEVER, there were so many complaints regarding Part I of this series (when it first ran on British TV), the producers changed course and made single story episodes that stood on their own and WHAT A DIFFERENCE! Part II of this series is sold separately so skip Part I and purchase Part II, now that is enjoyable, this Part I...not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"amaturish production","review":"As a big Dr. Who fan, I'm complety disappointed. The worst thing about the sixth season of Who is the sound. Often the music and/or incidental sounds are so loud they drown out what the actors are saying. The first 4 years of the new series are fantastic, and the acting and production are superb. But the new doctor overacts, and not in an entertaining fashion.goodbye Doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 6 Part 1?","review":"BBC series' are already short (like 10-12 episodes per season). I love the show and have been a fan for years. The spin this season has seems to be geared towards drawing in American audiences, but is still entertaining. I think Neil Gaiman's episode \\"the Doctor's Wife\\" is my favorite since the last Christmas episode with Michael Gambon. BUT, and it is a big BUT (no puns please), Whats the deal with breaking up the seasons in to seperate discs??? Battlestar Galactica did this half way through and I refused to buy them as well. Give us one box PER season and stop milking your fan base!! jerks!! I give it 5 stars because I like the show. This multi disc per season gets -3 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuk","review":"I can't say exactly why but Dr Who just doesn't garb my interest anymore.

This is a quintessential Ken Burns documentary, with great shots of Monticello, a good overview of Jefferson's contradictions from his politics to his status as a Virginia slave owner, and excellent commentary by prominent historians.

Don't waist your money on this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Jefferson - A Film by Ken Burns","review":"I enjoyed this film very much. You can alway expect a in-depth program from Ken Burns. My only complaint is that when they got to the area of Jefferson life regarding Sally Hemings they really just skimmed the surface and really did not have the interviews or research that I thought would occur. I found it very insulting that two of the historians thought it was impossible for him to have had a relationship with a slave. After that I lost interest in anything that they said.

Finally Sony stopped making rear projection TVs all together. I have had Sony products for 30 years and have never experienced anything like this.Sony will not honor their obvious design flaws and failed attempts to make a reliable product.As one TV tech put it \\" they are still trying to catch up with the new technology\\".

I contacted Sony and they said the lamp door was not on right. I checked and it was. So I called a tv repair man. They came out and fixed the activor switch. 140.00. Tv then had a red band at top of screen. Contacted Sony again. They told me to take it to a certified Sony repairman. The problem is there are no Sony repairman in my area. They are 2 hours away. After arguing with Sony they finally offered me a new tv for a discounted rate. A 1599.99 tv for 768.00. But I already spend 300.00 for new bulb and repair service.

Researching of the web determined it was a manufacturer flaw and is very expensive to fix. I called Sony, which admitted the flaw, admitted it was extending the warranty on some projection LCDs, but this particular model was not included. So I asked for Sony to honor its no cost electronics take back program and schedule a pick up to recycle it. I was given a bogus web site and two bogus phone numbers.

If you haven't already read Valis, this book won't make much sense to you. The first portion of Valis is almost autobiographical and describes some very strange events that happened to Dick in the early 70's. He then spent the rest of his life trying to understand what happened to him, and wrote voluminous notes on his theorizing. The collected notes he called his \\"Exegesis,\\" which is a theological term meaning \\"interpretation of scripture\\" (I told you they were very strange events.) Some of his Exegesis made it's way into Valis and other books. This volume contains even more. Unfortunately, he never really comes to a \\"final answer,\\" which makes him different from the Apostle Paul, but this is a fascinating volume nonetheless. Fans of Gnosticism will find this book even more interesting than I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Edited","review":"Philip K. Dick was a brilliant man who, like many brilliant men, has been posthumously mishandled by editors, biographers, etc. In Pursuit of Valis, I believe, is a further example of this. The editor's introduction is poorly written and riddled with assumptions and errors. The material in the book is choppy and poorly edited. Phil Dick never intended this material to be sold, he never will see any profits on the sale of this book, so who profits from its sale? The editor? His estate? His fans? I don't know. I am sure Sutin is getting his cut. Some of us wish that he would leave Phil Dick alone. But, that aside, if you are going to publish works not written for public consumption, at least do it properly. Surely, the volume could have been edited so as to make the material easier to comprehend? And what of the sloppy printing?

And cheap-looking DVDs...Content is fun, but only fascinating in part. About what you'd expect from a decent TV documentary. The IMAX format is lost even on my widescreen setup, and the resulting wide-angle distortion is sometimes a distraction.Tech note: I also noticed poor colour resolution - distinct colour graduations which I've not seen on other DVDs.

They made a sequel that was just as great as the original. An old fashioned adventure game that doesn't want you to kill people (or things), just makes you think and use your head.

I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"I thought that Syberia I was one of the best adventure games ever produced. Syberia II continues the story line and has superb graphics just like the first one. I believe more work should've been put into creating relevant, logical puzzles for the game. There were too many puzzles that required exhausting random permutations (rather than logic) to reach the solution, e.g., the fishing puzzle had 27 combinations, the 'heart' puzzle had 121 both with no apparent logic to the final solution.I'm not disappointed that I bought the game; but I was expecting a better, fully thought out experince like in Syberia I."},{"rating":"1","title":"not nearly as good as the first","review":"the first syberia i really enjoyed, a few boring parts but in general, very nice. syberia 2 on the other hand is less than what i had expected. the main issue i have with this game is dialogue. lets face it, its terrible. for example, you talk to a girl in which she says her name is anna voralberg. when you talk to her next, your character says: \\"are you anna voralberg?\\" its things like this that bastardize a game. unfortunately, its like this throughout the entire thing. at one point your character is yelling and insulting a priest and right after that, youre calm and wishing him a good day. its poor planning in the dialogue department. oh, and another thing... the puzzles are weak. they seem like theyre going to be a chalenge, and its not... and other times your wondering \\"why the hell did i pick this up?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent follow-on to the original","review":"As many other reviews have suggested, Syberia II is a near-seamless segue from the original game. But despite the natural feel between the games, Syberia II is like a whole new chapter, and plays a bit differently. While the original was like a bit of a race to follow Hans' trail from city to city, the second game is more remote and deeply immerses you in the beauty and lore of the exotic Russian north. You can tell that the developers put a lot of care into the game, from improvements to the gameplay to the beauty of the settings and puzzles.If you like adventure games as much as I do, then you simply must try the Syberia games. While I miss the Gabriel Knight and Tex Murphy games of old, the rich story and backdrop of Syberia was like a great novel I did not want to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sequel!","review":"If you liked the first one, I think you'll love the sequel.

The only thing keeping me going was the fact that I was finally going to get to see Syberia. From that little city, to the middle of nowhere (like the novel of Huck Finn) and finally to Syberia the game lacks any direction what-so-ever and the puzzles are those of repitition, not thinking.I fell asleep during the playing of this game numorous times.Save your money, buy a candy bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can really tell that this was self-published","review":"Yes, granted, I do not agree with her theological concept of the Godhead, but I have seen better pro-trinitarian arguments from oneness preachers! Not to be mean, but you can really tell that this book was self-published (not that I am putting down on self-published books, but truly this was the only way that she could have this on the shelf). She has no clear understanding of oneness thought, Greek, or even Tertullian's Latin. She butchers Magee's book and often goes on rants about things unrelated to the topic at hand. Amazing enough, she is still attending a oneness church, although she is a trinitarian. She never does once approach the topic with any scholarly sense and instead leaves you wondering if she is still on the same topic. If I was a trinitarian, I would, after reading this book, begin to consider a change in my dogma, if, after 1800 years, this is what trinitarian apology has come to. I recommend French's book: \\"Our God is One\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality band","review":"I have reviewed this watch 2 other times on Amazon, but the review keeps disappearing. It must be because it was honest and not to their liking. The band on this watch started coming apart before it was a year old. I bought it last March and the band looks so bad I cannot wear it until I have it replaced. Tag Heuer provides NO WARRANTY on the bands. Buyer beware, its beautiful when you first buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before you consider buying this book...","review":"I compared this book with the Japanese verb guide I actually bought, called the Complete Japanese Verb Guide. I highly recommend that book over this one. I agree with the other reviewers here that 501 should have Japanese characters. The Complete Japanese verb guide gives the kanji for the verb as well as romanization for beginners. It's a better book all around, so I would suggest turning this one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair, But Would Be Better If It Used Japanese","review":"I originally bought the book as a resource for teaching a Japanese class. Then I returned it to the book store because it was not useful enough. I found it useful because it shows how to conjugate verbs. However, the one important thing that it is missing is ACTUAL JAPANESE CHARACTERS. Japanese can be written for foreign language learners using the Roman (or Latin) alphabet, in the way this book does. However, if you want to learn Japanese, you have to see it in Japanese characters. This book does not use any Japanese characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a book for Japanese language learners?","review":"I bought this useless book and a similarly useless book for conjugating Korean verbs before Amazon started publishing reader reviews, so I didn't know the conjugations were romanized. Any serious learner of Japanese learns the Kana right away, so using romanized Japanese in this kind of book is silly. I could not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Do not buy this book. Unlike English Japanese verbs are extremely regular and easily congugated. It is more important that you learn the rules and not very difficult, then you will be able to congugate every single verb yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do You Enjoy Watching Paint Dry?","review":"This is probably one of the least useful Japanese language learning tools I've bought.In fairness to the Author(s), it does cover what it claims, it will. It just isn't really very useful or interesting.Everything is in romaji which makes the book limited in application and at the same time the 501 verbs really only cover a few different verb types. You would be better offer with a shorter intridcution to Japanese verbs (Like The complete Guide To Japanese Verbs) and a dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh! Another Romanized Asian language book","review":"For serious students of Japanese, this book is useless because all the verb conjugations are done in Romanji. I am an American learning Japanese in Korea, and here students learn Hiragana from the first day of class. If this book is published in REAL Japanese, then I will buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as useful as I thought.","review":"I have many Japanese friends and they tell me the verbs used in this book are rarely used in Japanese conversation. The only reason I still use it is conjugate verbs into te and ta forms. I would seriously consider anyone interested to look elsewhere, for this book has been a big dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Thought Out","review":"Because this author uses his own original way of transcribing Japanese into Roman characters, this book is, at times, somewhat confusing. For example, normally the hiragana character 'tsu' is written in Romaji as such. The way it is pronounced, there is a very definite combination of 't' and 's'. This book writes it as 'tu.' I fail to see how that makes it more accurate. It makes it LESS accurate. I don't know who he is aiming this book at, but the pronunciation of many of his transcriptions, in everyday spoken Japanese, would clearly be wrong.Better to buy 'The Complete Japanese Verb Guide,' by the Hiroo Japanese Center. Far more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a mess!","review":"Apart from being a waste time, since there are only a few conjugation patterns in Japanese, and almost all verbs follow them regularly, the phonetic transcriptions are very confusing. Japanese has its own accurate phonetic transcriptions using the Latin alphabet (Romanji), and anyone who learns this system, will have to re-learn the proper one, which is used in Japan and in any decent book.I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money~~","review":"First, it does not use anything but the Roman alphabet- no furigana whatsoever. If you have a desire to know this many verbs, you will be annoyed that this book doesn't use furigana. This book attempts to directly translate all those verbs- a misleading way to learn another language. Some words have a direct translation, mostly nouns. Verbs are not this easy. Definately not 501 of them!!Also, I had a Japanese friend look at this book and tell me which forms I will use and which I won't, and he scratched out more than half listed on the page!! I wouldn't even recommend this for a Sunday learner..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I don't know how this book ever got made. Who could possibly have thought this was a good idea? A book like this makes sense for a language that has lots of irregular verbs (French come to mind). Japan has less than a dozen irregular verbs. This makes the book utterly worthless.If the book included example sentences or detailed discussions of usage or anything else useful, I would be less harsh. The closest thing to being useful is the humble/honorific forms, but a table of 1-2 pages takes care of the special cases for that.There are plenty of other *good* \\"Japanese verb\\" books out there, go buy one of them instead.If I could give this book zero points I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fixed the hardware!","review":"I've been buying these shoulder bags for many years now as mine have worn out from daily use and the latest update fixes some of the last niggles I had with the design: the metal hardware used to fatigue and break after a couple of years. The new hardware design is much beefier and should make the bag last even longer.The other improvement I have noticed in the latest version is that it now includes a small reinforced fabric loop on the back, which makes it a lot easier to hang it from a coat hook or to tie it up with other items.It has always been a sturdy and well-designed bag, so even in the days of weak(er) hardware, I kept coming back to more of the same as they wore out. Now, I can look forward to doing it less frequently! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Also a waistpack!","review":"Although this order took nearly 2 weeks to arrive, arrive it did--and to my delight, this sturdy little bag also doubles as a waistpack. I have always worried that someone might just reach up and unclip and steal a waistpack. It would be very difficult to unclip this one; the join is hidden under the long loop behind (waist side) the bag, and the clips have their own protection. (It's much easier to look at than describe, but it's quite secure). It is small, about 6\\" x 9\\" x 2.25\\", but that's a plus for keeping things light and hidden under a jacket. Now I can easily switch from a cross shoulder bag to a waistpack. Great!Please note that Amazon says it is 13\\" x 9\\" x 4\\". Not so. It's about 6\\" x 9\\" x 2.25\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for travel","review":"I have to preface by admitting that I'm not to keen on the man-purse, and just can't do the fanny pack. Still, for my last vacation to Southeast Asia, I knew that my girlfriend would be having me tote some of her travel things, and I didn't want to be lugging loads around in my pants pockets. Thus, I swallowed my (fashion) pride, and found this Pacsafe bag. In choosing a bag, it came down to a small backpack or the small shoulder bag, but in terms of security, I thought that the Pacsafe was less likely to be pickpocketed than a backpack. It was great for our trip, holding my two cell phones, camera, maps, receipts, sunglasses, and miscellaneous small knick-knacks. Truth told, I still feel a twinge of gawkiness when I see photos of myself carrying it on our trips, but sometimes you have to put function over form, and the function on this bag is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Great little bag for my iPhone, point & shoot camera, my small wallet and keys. When I don't want to haul around a big bag -- this is perfect! I'm going to travel to Bolivia, and this bag provides me with the confidence I need that my important items will be safe and slash proof. I also have the Pacsafe Metrosafe 200 for when I need to carry a few more items. It's a great bag as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I selected this product specifically because it was a bit smaller than the other packs but still roomy enough for everything I wanted to carry. I was surprised how much I could fit into it and love all the little pockets inside so everything has it's place. My only problem is that it's made for the \\"buffet people\\" and doesn't fit around my waist only my hips so I worry it will slide all the way down.

I have viewed many of his works, and this one would easily make my \\"Best Documentary List\\" top 5. He crafts his stories so well that it almost has the feel of a movie - you don't realize you're watching history - and I can't remember many documentaries that give you a lump in your throat, at the end, and almost bring you to tears as this one does.This extraordinary chronicle of Lewis and Clark's exploration/adventure is 4 hours long (divided onto two discs).

It makes you think about exactly what it would have been like for these explorers to see the west for the first time, as a vast prarie unblemished by human technology.

I also highly recommend the soundtrack that goes with this film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Hot Air","review":"If you're looking for a book to tell you how to manifest something you want, this book is NOT it. The first third of the book is just an introduction about the author's life at Findhorn (who cares?). The book is extremely repetitive telling you ad nauseum about how everything is all one and you're divine (heresy?). The prose is so dense that reading it is like walking down a long hallway filled with cotton candy. He doesn't give clear directions on HOW to manifest anything (e.g., do A, B, & C, and you'll get result D).

This Sony Flash Player has proven to be a great tool. It's highly compact, and yet still holds quite a few songs. It also has pretty good sound quality, though I find the ear buds to be a tad awkward. The USB plug-in makes it really easy to charge your player and load/unload songs at the same time on your computer.One minor qualm I have with this product is the software. It's not very user-friendly. Furthermore, while I can get the software to work on my HP desktop, I can't get it to work at all on my SONY laptop computer, which I find baffling.Nonetheless, though I find my Zen to be far superior to this particular player, this one is great for the price, and outstanding if you're looking for something small and relatively easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money on this one","review":"The included software is very hard to use and most stupidly written. I add wma files to the library and convert them to Sony's supported format. Then I delete the wma files from both computer and library from within the software. The software will delete the converted files also from the computer though they are neither in the library nor in wma format. How stupid can Sony get?The player sometines doesn't recognize some wma files. All files have to be converted to a different format. The player control itself are hard to use. The player's USB port stopped working within 45 days of purchase. Sony support says that my only repair option is to have the player exchanged with a refurbished one even though the player is under full parts and labor warranty.

I consider him to be an excellent writer and storyteller. However, the \\"His Dark Materials\\" books deal with issues that need to be thought over and discussed carefully. I appreciated this book as a well-thought out and interesting look at Philip Pullman's background, his personal views, his goals in writing the books, and the historical and religious background behind the books. I especially appreciated the author's candid expression of his enjoyment of the books. He admitted that he was a fan of Philip Pullman, while disagreeing with his message. I enjoyed seeing a Christian opinion of the book that fully appreciated Philip Pullman's wonderful storytelling, but still seriously considered anti-Christian or anti-Church messages in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not good enough...the heroine just wasn't there!","review":"Mountain Laurel was a pretty good book...but I just didn't thought it was complete enough because the heroine, Maddie, just wasn't the heroine that should have been there. In my opinion, I think Jude made Maddie way too concieted, selfish, and and way too vain. First of all, Maddie keeps on saying that her voice is the best in the world, and in my opinion, that's way too vain! I couldn't stand it! And she's selfish because all she cared about was herself and not anything about 'Ring. She just wanted him to follow her around the world to listen to her sing, and she didn't care a cinch about 'Ring's Warbrooke Shipping Co. All she cared about was her own life, and how she has to sing...blah blah blah! But I'll give Jude some credit on 'Ring, the hero. He was nice, kind, and sweet. All he did was think of the best, but no...Maddie didn't care. All she thought about was herself.

I never did understand why the Montgomery chap went West or why he stayed so long. The ego of the heroine was only exceeded by her general stupidity, and when the hero and heroine get together, it's amongst the most disgusting couplings imaginable. (A log cabin, with a force that pushes the heroine across a floor---full of either splinters or dirt---and bangs her head up the wall while 100 or so miners are outside taking bets on when they'll come out. YUK.) The little sister is also a strange character. She speaks with a hill billy accent, even though she grows up in the Rockies and has a cultured mother and an educated father.

I agree with some of the other reviewers about their opinion of the heroine - she was just a little too vain. (And what in the world was the little sister all about? - she was creepy). The most redeeming part of the book was Ring. He was great. I never saw him as the heroine did. I thought everything he did was to protect her. At least in the end everything worked out enough to leave me satisfied - unlike some other of Ms. Deveraux's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I'm usually such a big fan of Jude Deveraux. Her name is enough to make me buy the novel. This one, however, was a huge disappointment. Its overpriced and so not worth it. There is zero chemistry between the hero and heroine, the so called romantic moments between the two feel forced. There is none of the usual Jude humour and magic. Even the dialogue lacks fizz.

The OCR is full of errors, the preface is missing pages, the numbers in the index do not correspond to the page numbers of the book, and the tables at the end of the book have been left out.To the publisher's credit, there is a link to a web site where one can download the original scan of the book. It's not a very high quality scan, but it is fairly legible and the missing tables are there (though not the missing pages of the preface).If this is good enough for you, then you will not be disappointed. If you are looking for an actual reprinting of the book, I'm afraid you are either stuck with the abridged version (which is not bad, but is abridged) or you must wait until the book is properly reprinted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"Perhaps a warning to people who think about purchasing this book: apperantly it's made by scanning in an older version and using a computer to recognise the letters or something like that. This means the book is full of annoying SPELLING MISTAKES and that there are NO TITLES AT ALL (!). The book is just text, nothing to organise it, while a book like this REALLY needs structure.If this is the only option to get your hands on this book, if you can read past the numerous mistakes and if you are organised enough to think all the titles along, then you might consider buying this item.

It seems that the author, after having spent time in a German think-tank and needing to mine some gold out of it, hobbled together a novel from his impressions of Berlin, to which he added an incredibly thin plot revolving around the crisis of his 60ish film-making hero. The writing is very, very pretty, but not always clear. Sentences don't just run on but run amok. Everone talks alike. The action, what there is of it, is poorly motivated. There are numerous digressions, while seeming essentials are absent. The saving grace is what one learns about political and cultural thinking in today's re-unified East Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the tassle one better","review":"The Cullman is not as smart looking as its counterpart with the tassles, although it is comfortable after the first wearing.

Boo HBO!!","review":"My low 2 Star rating is only for this Complete Set. I give the series as a whole 5 STARS. I wholeheartedly recommend owning the series, in either this form or individual seasons. But if you already own seasons one through four on dvd, don't bother with this set. There is nothing new going on here. Every extra is something that has already been seen on the individual season dvds. And according to the description here it may or may not contain the prequels from the season three set. You'd think we could have gotten some new commentary, or interviews with extended cast members, or audition footage, or bloopers, or gag reel, OR ANYTHING NEW. So if you don't own any Big Love yet, go right ahead a get this set. But if you already have others, just complete your collection with the individual sets.

It's also full of really useful info for identifying and dealing with the same story yourself. It doesn't slow you down with whining overaccounted stories like some books on affairs do. It shows you, through example, how many different scenarios might happen.

Furthermore, they weren't necessarily signs that your husband is cheating on you,... they were signs that your husband is simply mean to you! The examples the authors gave were signs that it is simply time to leave the relationship because he is no good for your self esteem. One example given is if your husband is saying you're fat, then he's cheating on you. Another example was that if he comes home late to Thanksgiving dinner WITH a GIRLFRIEND, then chances are he's cheating on you. You think???It was really a waste of money. It treated the reader like they had no brain, therefore it was an insult to women to even pick the book up.

The book's notion that women are soley the victims of men is myopic. If a partner in a relationship is reading this stuff, probably they are in a bad relationship. Maybe they should reexamine how they got into this relationship in the first place? I think social pressure for women to get married is at the root of the problem. Many will \\"settle\\" just to be married. If things don't click before you march down to the altar, they probably won't be that great after the I dos have been spoken. Many men take women at their word and unfortunately, that is a bad mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick-pocrisy","review":"I may be a little cynical, but women who write books like this seem to regard infidelity as a \\"crime\\" perpetrated exclusively by men against women, and this is not so. Would the authors of this book consider writing a book about how a husband can tell whether or not his wife is engaging in an adulterous relationship?Chick-pocrisy, obviously, is a combination of chick and hypocrisy. Chicks tend to believe that events like infidelity are heinous crimes when committed by men but are just unfortunate when committed by women or \\"chicks\\". If a man cheats on his wife, he should suffer the most severe penalties. If a wife is unfaithful to her husband, we must understand what her husband did to drive her to infidelity."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Script: The 100% Absolutely Predicatable Things Women Say When They're Bitter","review":"This book should be in the Adult Humor section of your local library or bookstore and should under no circumstances be taken seriously.

This book is written from the perspective of two divorced women, they say all men follow the same script when cheating, and it must be the men. If they can see that pattern with all the men, why not flip the script and see what all these women have in common to drive these men to commit such acts of selfishness, cruelty, and hatred.

Reading them now, I am confronted with the fact that Burroughs was a very poor writer, with little literary ability and a poor ear for dialogue. What he did have was an imagination, and the concept of Caspak- a place where evolution happens to the individual is a fascinating one. However, Burroughs' leaden style weighs it down, and the fact that Burroughs was clearly an obsessive racist (a subhuman race is described as 'negroid') makes this a hard book to read. A rare case where the book is worse than the film (those who have seen it will know what I mean!)

I'd Give Anything was the lead single from his Groove On CD. Gerald Levert's emotive baritone excels on Groove On. The Levert feel is evident on every side. Productions, arrangements and songs are by Gerald Levert and Edwin Nicholas, save for a couple, the most notable being \\"I'd Give Anything\\" by David Foster. \\"Answering Service\\" stands out with its opening monologue; \\"Have Mercy\\" illustrates Gerald's powerful begging style of delivery to perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giselle 1969 DVD","review":"This is a good video.

That's how badly he directed this version of Giselle. I also have watched some excellent ballet DVDs in the past year, so I knew that this ballet had to have been performed better.

What should have been a glorious opportunity to capture Fracci and Bruhn in their signature partnership is ruined by the meddlesome and ignorant direction of Hugo Niebeling and David Blair. Giselle is a ballet; ballet is about dance; dance should be the focus of attention. We should have unobstructed views of the dancers dancing. Instead, we get shots through villagers eating and talking, shots from above, shots from the side, shots through machinery, shots reflected in pools, and so on - absolutely infuriating, unartistic, and puerile. What a shame and a sham! What a colossal misunderstanding of art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRAVESTY OF DANCE","review":"How David Blair could allow this insult to the dancers is beyond me. I noted that some people liked the performance, but I'm at a loss to know how they actually saw the performance! Trying to watch an artist dance, through the back of huge hats, bad quality glass and anything else the director could find to put in front of them, was, to say the least, distracting. Add to that a camera that was moving so constantly that I almost felt sea-sick and editing that rarely stayed on the same shot for more than a few seconds and constantly interrupted the dance with completely irrelevant and distracting views of everything from a plate of fruit to galloping horses as seen from a galloping horse! Ballet is a theatrical art, but many others have shown that it can be totally cinematic.

That is, it won't print even when the pages are still coming out with plenty of toner. I keep having to fiddle with it just to get out another few pages. And YES, I am using a Brother toner cartridge and not some \\"compatible\\" cartridge.I would appreciate having it tell me when I'm low on toner, but don't like that it keeps me from printing when the pages still look good.

It performs extremely well. The print quality is on par with the HP I use at work. After having printer more than 1000 pages I had yet encountered a problem (paper jam, etc). No problem with printing mailing labels and envelopes either. I only wish that they would include in the package a printed user manual and a USB cable.Note that the printer can do 15 ppm if you're printing the same page over and over again. Otherwise you get around 6 ppm.The printer takes a single standard 72pin SIMM (I'm using a 8meg, Fastpage module--not sure about EDO RAM; I do know that a double-sided module wouldn't fit).

Fast, no jams, just perfect for lots of printing. Within 6 months, it started cranking out GREY PAGES. Like everyone else, I bought new toner but that didn't help. The grey pages obliterate any printing I try to do. A new drum costs at least $130. Be very careful of the reconditioned ones because they can hide the grey page problem for a short while but it's the drum that is bad. All in all, Brother took me for $250 and the new toner which is full but unusable.

I found that about one out of every three has problems with the print drum or jamming. This is of course, for high volume government users used to creating many pages of documents. Another thing I didn't like about these HL-1440's was that whenever there are errors, the lights blink flash flash yellow/green only, and that's for all errors! It could be a damaged drum, out of paper, out of toner. And another thing, when you replace the toner, you should replace the drum that fits with the toner. Another $135!

The HP laserjet only produces very bad prints but it still does print. As for the quality of regular prints. Well, I find it to be effective and fast. The drivers are well writen an offer great options. I will say that one of the few problems come when you send to much information. It seems to loose control and not process if you are sending to much.

I saw this printer as a good alternative to expensive Lexmark inkjet cartridges and expensive HP laser toner. Also, I had an earlier model (300 DPI) Brother laser that worked great for 4 years. . . .beware of the low price . . .or, buy two. The first one will need to be replaced before the toner runs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I've had experience with two of these machines, one at work and another I later purchased for home use.

There is always a line on the paper you print - it doesn't matter how many times you clean it - it will go away for a few days and reappear. I could literally not get 10 pages to print without at least 3 of them having lines - this after cleaning the printer completely many MANY times.2. Alarm buttons blink for no reason.3. Manual feeder doesn't always pick up labels/paper. When you are printing postage this is one huge nightmare.I'll never buy a Brother anything again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This printer is a piece of crap","review":"I used this printer for a few months and it started to put smears of toner all over the copies. Plus, there doesn't seem to be any way to reset it. I accidentally printed a web page that printed one line per page (190 pages!). I tried turning the printer off, holding the button, unplugging it, pulling the USB cable, removing the paper, pounding on it and cursing. Nothing helped. It was like one of those horror movies where the monster keeps coming back to life. It just resumed printing where it left off. It's still in there. I can't use the thing anymore, unless I want to run through a half a package of paper to let it finish, so I'm using my Epson inkjet. The printout will still be in there when I throw the printer out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but trouble","review":"I have bought hundreds of items from amazon.com, but this is the first that has inspired me to write a review. I bought this printer about a year and a half ago and had print quality problems with it from the start. To their credit, Brother replaced my original drum at no charge, since it was apparently bad when I bought it, and I have replaced the toner cartridge once since then, as well. The print quality has never been very good, even when the drum and cartridge were new, but it has been getting even worse over the last couple of months--the pages are now all gray, apart from the lovely vertical streaks of white that run down through the text. The drum light is not on, but even if I knew that was the problem I wouldn't replace it. I'm not buying anymore replacement items for this. I give up on this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is it?","review":"Okay, the product probably rates a 5 from everything I've read. Unfortunately, I have no personal knowledge to judge this product; despite a claim of being \\"in stock\\" and shipping \\"in 1-2 days\\", its now been several weeks and I still have no printer! Its been charged to my credit card, but every day I check the status of the order & every day the delivery date keeps getting pushed back.

I do not do a lot of printing, but what I have thrown at the 1440 has turned out great. It is FAST and high quality. The only downside I can see is the initial RAM amount (4 megs), but I can upgrade that if I ever run into a bottleneck down the road. Warm-up takes a few seconds and printing is a little noisy, but not bad. When in sleep mode, it is whisper quiet.Installation was easy (using a USB cable) - just run the installer and then plug it in, no problems. The only strangeness I encountered was a new service being added to my computer (XP Pro) that doesn't seem to accomplish anything. I can disable the service and print without a problem, so I'm not sure why it had to be installed and running in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bet you never thought about this...","review":"This printer pulls enough power to make the lights flicker in my mom's house. Admittedly, the house's wiring is old. But this printer says it needs 7.7 amps (that's what the tag on the back says, not what Brother's web site says), while the comparable HP printer uses 2.2 amps. Even if you have modern wiring in your house or business, you might not want to waste that much juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buying a World of Trouble","review":"This would be a real deal -- if only it was compatible with Windows XP, which it is not.

Even their website is useless.Not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a disposable printer....","review":"Worked very well until the original toner cartridge ran out (took about a year as I don't print much).

I don't print every day, but I do use it, and I've only had to replace the toner twice. I've had the problem with the gray pages that others have complained about - a new toner cartridge solved it right away. This printer has lasted through five computers, so I'd say I got my money's worth!One recommendation is to upgrade the memory - this gets you the fastest printing speeds, and is pretty cheap if you shop around for memory instead of buying from Brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drives me nuts","review":"I hate this printer.

Anyway, I've suffered the same problems as many of these other users - the printing gets spotty and grey about a year after I started using it. I was considering buying a new drum but not after I read the reviews. I don't want to waste my money.

About 9 months later, it started to print pages with dark gray background. And that declares the end of life for this printer.

Unfortunately, I am now just experiencing the problems that others have had with this printer after using it for a while. EVERY page printed has a faint gray background over the entire page, with slightly darker gray streaks along the margins. Troubleshooting using the included Users Manual, and the Brother website, doesn't help. Latest peculiarity is a black streak and specks appearing only when I print to envelopes using the single-sheet feeder. Haven't tried contacting Brother, but I don't hold much hope. **_AVOID THIS PRINTER!!!_**"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, Junk","review":"I own both the 1440 and 1450 and they both had the streaking problem from 6 months to a year.

They should advertise these are disposable printers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like a light gray background on all of your documents","review":"I purchased this astonishingly low priced printer in December of 2002. It was used casually, maybe an average of 5 printed pages a week (not much). It worked great for about a year. Then the annoying light gray background developed, which appears to be a common problem judging by all of the reviews; apparenly the drum unit is poorly designed or manufactured. It's not a big deal if you're just using it to print receipts and personal items, but the faint gray background makes it unsuitable if you need to print out a resume or anything that needs to look professional. I haven't had any other problems with it besides this one.With rebates I've seen this thing as low as $89 in recent months. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't buy it even for that low of a price. Spend your money on a better model or different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feeling cheated","review":"I feel like I shouldn't add anymore review for this product, but I'm obligated to since this product is a waste of money and Brother should have it recalled like what they're doing with their other printers.The first few months, print quality was clear (not one hundred per cent clear since I had to constantly clean the Drum unit by sliding the little thing on it), but after about five months, quality was dirty. Printouts would have black smudges and streaks. There would be a barely readable duplicate of a document I printed on the same page, kind of acting like a background. Solutions that Brother recommended did not work.This printer costs about $165 dollars. Buying a new Drum unit and a new toner is also about that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute junk","review":"After only a couple of weeks, the printer started printing streaks on the first page of a print job. Cleaning the corona wire 30 times and wiping the drum with a cloth (as suggested by technical support) did not fix it.Worst printer experience I have ever had (and I am responsible for 20 printers). Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the money, you can't beat it!","review":"In terms of bang for the buck, you can't beat it. Easy to setup in Windows 2000, slightly more challenging to setup in Windows XP since you need to go get drivers. Not a big deal. Print quality is great for home/small office use. My only complaint was the power thing. It drains electricity when it's running and causes the lights to dim in the room. Good foot-print and bottom paper feed works well. I've seen too may top feed printers jam after light use.I'd buy another Brother 1440 if I needed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off - Sums it all","review":"The printer works well except for the print drum that leaves streaks all over the page, when I called Brother they said that the drum has gone bad...it's less than a year since I have brought and have probably printed less than 300 pages. A new print drum is $135 which is $20 more than the amount I paid for the printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Throw-Away Printer","review":"What's Hot - 1.5 years effortless operation. During that time excellent printing!What's Not - Changed the drum when toner ran low - ever after - the fatal symptom of streaking and poor print quality. No support for EPS files.You wanna like it for what is does well but can't help being pissed off that it's designed to fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother, where art thou!","review":"I too made a mistake and purchased a Brother HL-1450 laser printer. These printers consistently garner rave reviews and unfortunately I got suckered. All one has to do is check the customer reviews at Amazon.com or Epinions.com for the HL-12XX and HL-14XX printers to determine there are some significant print quality issues with any Brother laser printer utilizing the DR-400 image drum. Factor in the $120-$150 cost of a new drum every 2000 copies or so and you've got some serious operating expense. As advised by Brother technical support, I replaced the image drum to rectify the dreaded \\"gray background\\" problem, only to have it reappear roughly 2000 copies later. Imagine, a laser printer with a toner supply that outlasts the image drum. Needless to say, I will defer another drum replacement and use the money to purchase a new non-Brother laser printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The printer has bad drum","review":"I've bought this printer brand new from Office Max and used it for 6 months. I've printed less than 50 pages during this 6 months. When I moved, I didn't used the printer for 6 months. When I used it again, the drum is damaged. I get 3 horizontal ink lines a a page when I print. I cleaned it up 3 times but it didn't help. I can see a line on the drum roll that I cannot clean it with tissue paper. The drum itself is damaged when I don't use the printer. Brother only warranty the drum and catrige for 3 months so I have to pay for new ones. It costs $$$ for the drum and $$$ for the ink catrige. Well, but if you buy a new printer, it'll cost you only $$$.I had a HP 4L laser printer before buying this Brother printer. I had this HP for 6 years and it's still working.So, Brother has problem with their printer drums and you should consider this when buying one. I'd better spend $$$ on a HP laser printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent little printer","review":"I've had this printer for about four months now and it works great. I use it as a print server through a router and it hooked up and worked easily. Good quality text and graphics though I'd offer that the laser on my high end work lasers may have a bit more contrast. I bought a generic memory card for $8. The auto off is a nice feature and first print time even when its been off is very reasonable - about 20 seconds. Toner prices, even when you eventually need to replace the drum, are still about the cheapest of any laser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it time...it will dissappoint","review":"This printer was excellent for several months.

After six weeks of daily use (about 20 pages per day) a black haze started to cover every page, progressively getting worse. I cleaned the printer with the special cleaning pads and this did not help. I then cleaned the drum and wire. This also did not fix the problem. Next I replaced the toner cartage, and this also did not fix the problem. Finally I replaced the drum and it worked great! The drum did not last the life of one toner cartage. The fix was over [$] for a [$] printer! NOT HAPPY! The printer is also slow to warm up on the first page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention Mac users!","review":"Attention Mac users! Everithing is wanderful about this printer, including the price. However, there is one little thing you should consider: THIS IS NOT A POSTSCRIPT PRINTER!!! Per Brother Solutions Center: \\"...if you are using a DTP application such as QuarkExpress or Adobe Illustrator, it is often better to use a Postscript emulation driver such as the BR-Script driver that might be supplied with the printer. Please note the BR-Script printer drver will only be supplied on printers that support the Brother BR-Script.\\" Since brother HP-1440 does not support the BR-Script drive, be prepared to see jagged edges, poor res images, dot-matrix look when you print copy from Acrobat, Photoshop, Illustrator, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"this Brother never helped me out","review":"This printer is bad news.

I connected it and it refused to print at this resolution, with a rather washed-out appearance that was quoted to be at 600 dpi.

I asked what to do about it and they suggested that I return it--which I did immediately"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"Within one week, the printer produced a first page with toner residue all over it every time it went to print from idle.

In fact it is still working today (I have never needed to replace the drum on it, btw). My Brother 1440 lasted 8 months.It was quite nice when it was working - fast with good quality text. But that nice quality text goes down quite a bit when your entire page is smudged and streaked. It was sometimes so bad you couldn't read the text and my printouts resembled a bad photocopy.Like many others, I will never own a \\"Brother anything\\" again. In fact I recently traded in this piece of junk to HP as part of HP's 2006 fall laser printer trade-in program, and got $75 towards a nice HP laser. So I guess the Brother did come in useful after all..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious flaw","review":"As long as you want to print in portrait orientation this printer does a fair job. However, if you want to print in landscape mode (and who doesn't from time to time) this printer has a serious flaw. The Brother HL-1440 will not accept landscape orientation if you have any other print drivers installed on your machine. And to make matters worse the only solution offered by Brother is to remove all other print drivers (I guess Brother finds this to be an easier solution than actually fixing the software).I advise anyone who is considering this printer to carefully investigate this problem. First, check this problem out for yourself on the brother website... they at least acknowledge the problem. Second, make sure you will never need another print driver installed on your machine. If I had known about this before I purchased the Brother HL-1440 I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage product; do not buy","review":"When I was young, I used to work at a flea market selling cheap electronic equipment. Some new, some rebuilt. The person I worked for had no problem selling items that he knew did not work. He assumed that the person would come back and we would exchange for another one. I was never comfortable with this approach.I think that person now works for Brother. This printer has a profoundly defective design. Brother must know about it (just read these boards, or others such as at CNET). Mine was defective out of the box. Smudged print output with lines down the page. Fortunately, I purchased it at Staples so I could easily return for a full refund. I will never buy another product from Brother. I used to think that they were a reasonably reliable brand name. Not any more.My advice: for a low-end high-quality laser B&W; printer, get the HP 1012."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Printer","review":"I was not impressed with the typography of the 1440 when I first used it and over this last year the print quality has become unacceptable. I bought a new drum and toner and still the print is coming out very light and no longer is it dark or black as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"No print density control","review":"In general, the HL-1440 is pretty good. Easy setup... practically plug & play once I downloaded the latest driver software for Mac OS 10.2. Have printed at least 500 sheets since I bought it with nary a paper jam. Only one limitation: unlike other laser printers I have owned, the HL-1440 has no density control to make the printing darker or lighter. Mine prints very light in normal settings (and unacceptably invisible in toner saver mode). Some fonts print darker than others, so it's possible to get acceptable print density if you don't mind limiting your choice of fonts. The flip side is that because the HL-1440 is stingy with ink its toner cartridges last a long time, making it dramatically cheaper to own than competing printers. I'm finding it a capable draft printer -- 90% of my printing -- and keeping my old ink-jet printer for finished work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine For Text","review":"This printer was, at the time, a decent value for printing typical text-based documents. It's biggest problem is that it doesn't print graphics well at all. For instance, a Google map is virtually useless as you can barely make out enough detail (street names, thin road lines, etc) to make it worth while. I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best printer for your money","review":"I do a lot of b/w printing and was spending a ton of money on expensive injet cartridges. I bought this because a friend reccommened it to me. At first there was a problem, it jammed.

I get a whole box of paper, however many reams that is on one of the smaller toner cartridges. We're talking 35 bucks to print over a box of paper. Combined with their amazing customer service, this is by far the best printer I ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drum died after 12 months","review":"I bought this printer because of the initial low price. I must admit for the past year it has printed very well. I never experienced the \\"gray-background\\" printing issues of other reviewers. However, my printer just suddenly *died*. A little troubleshooting revealed the problem to be the printer drum. The cost of replacing the drum is almost the price of buying a new printer ($130-150).

I will try to give it a few more shots, but something tells me these dreadful images are going straight to the recycle bin. Most of the \\"people\\" look like deranged homeless people with extreme mental and hygiene problems.

Now that I've played it, I do like the game, but I think the original was better.The shadows and lighting effects are all there just as you remember from the original. The new version automates some of the tedious tasks for you (silent landings are now automatic) and holding the right trigger engages the fully automatic weapon, although you really rip through bullets fast AND the trigger is very sensitive.The missions are shorter than the original and there are more save points in between in this version.

The music certainly isn't on par with Halo or Medal of Honor(s). I wish the x-box live play was more than 4-player but in all honesty with 12 or even 8-players would have made the game too frantic but 6-players might have worked.

If you don't they will just come back to bite you in the ass. I didn't enjoy running around and doing the same thing over and over again.

The problem I had with this game was that there seemed to be a VERY specific route you were meant to take throughout the game, down to every move or maneuver you made.

The end result is being killed over and over until you figure out...was I supposed to go left or right at this part?...should I shoot this guy or pass by him?...do I open the door to the right or the left? Every decision seems to have a \\"right\\" decision, and it is TEDIOUS trial-and-error figuring out what the programmers had in mind for each minute detailed decision you make. You get killed, you try again, over and over until you find the one \\"correct\\" path. Very little, if any, freedom to move around...this game is an exercise in tedious repetition... go through the same scenarios over, and over, and over...until you stumble across the one solution.

Each song is introduced by The Wiggles, but before the song begins, there is a long scene of Captain Feathersword and his crew. For younger viewers, it's just asking too much of their attention span, and for parents watching with them, the break in the pacing makes it frustrating to watch. It seems like they're really pushing pretty hard to make Captain Feathersword the star of this DVD. The Wiggles also seem to have less of a presence than usual - several songs are accompanied by poorly-animated caricatures of the Wiggles rather than live action, and there is much less dancing than in other Wiggles DVDs. Overall, this DVD just seems to have been made in too much of a hurry, and it does not do justice to the excellent music from the Sailing Around the World CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummed","review":"My daughter is in LOVE with the Wiggles.

Captain Feathersword and the dancers sail around the world and intro the upcoming cities. Songs are about the cities and not the Wiggles usual catchy, silly songs. I think the Wiggles must have been gone on tour somewhere and left Captain Feathersword in charge of this one. The Wiggles don't appear that much. My toddlers usually love the Wiggles but this video doesn't even hold their attention. If your child is a little older and can follow lengthy dialog then they may enjoy this or if Captain Feathersword is their absolute favorite.

They love to dance to their songs, and, though we find the Wiggles simplistic and staid, some of their albums and videos are, we must admit, catchy. This video, though, is definitely one in which the Wiggles are past their prime. In fact, there are more animated shorts of the Wiggles than there are shots of the Wiggles themselves. You get to see a postcard or two of the not-so-fab Four every so often in the movie. I can hear them now: hey, let's take an all-expenses paid tour around the world and get the parents to pay for it.

Where are the Wiggles? We do not see them much on this DVD. \\"Wake up Crew!!\\" to parody \\"Wake up Jeff!!\\"--now that was pretty cheesy.

We're big Wiggles fans here, but this movie isn't suitable for under 3's and parents with short attention spans. You might want to borrow this from a friend or rent it before you buy. Be sure that your child is able to sit through an hour of the Captain and his ramblings before you commit to the purchase.For anyone going to the live show, don't worry.

Not only should the DVD be named \\"Captain Feathersword: Sailing Around the World\\", but when the background dancer that everyone loves to make fun of, Ben Murray, gets a featured part with lines (shudder!) you know we're all in trouble.With their new shows that started this week on Playhouse Disney it looks as if the Wiggles are taking a reduced role in their show as well; especially with the \\"Little Wiggles\\" segments and the spliced in performance clips from the various DVDs.

Way too much of the annoying Captain Feathersword and not enough of the Wiggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"twinsmom","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. Have the Wiggles gotten so \\"big\\" and so \\"busy\\" that they have forgotten their little fans....the ones that made them famous..and the ones that cannot dish out $$$ to see them in person? The animated Wiggles bored my twins to tears...usually they are enamored with the Wiggles. I'd like to say \\"Wake up Wiggles!\\" it's time to rely on what made you famous, your love of children and your self-composed songs, you are losing touch with your fans, and the parents that have supported you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and your sanity!","review":"My son is one of the biggest Wiggles fans in the universe and even he won't watch this video twice. It is primarily Captain Feathersword being obnoxiously lame, and the songs aren't all that great. Get Live Hot Potatoes or Wiggly Wiggly World instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"The Wiggles make cameo appearances in this video featuring Captain Feathersword who should probably remain a supporting castmember. The Wiggles magic is nowhere to be found on this video...As many have said before me...save your money on this one. Sorry Wiggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT.","review":"I loved this video, my son is 3 yrs old and he loves it, he watches it none stop !!!,. The title says it all, Capt feathersword deserves his spot in the lime light, I only wish that they would have shown more of the the best wiggles dancer( Larrisa Wright) perhaps the most beautiful woman in the world.Thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"Totally bizarre premise. Will definitely appeal to those with a soft spot for art, music, civil disobedience, occupy movement, etc. Charming and unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"classic lounge","review":"Boring.Bobby Darin music does'nt inspire me like dallas holm or The Bee Gees.I could only tolerate about half the cd. Wish I could give it more wasted $2.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Simple-Minded","review":"This is more like \\"Surviving College for those in a Permanent Vegetative State.\\" I don't see how any 18-year-old could learn a thing from this; everything this guy says is painfully obvious and dumbed-down. It also has a weird conservative slant throughout. The chapter on sex sounds as though it were written by a Christian evangelical. The section on abortion draws heavily from the \\"research\\" of a frothing-at-the-mouth anti-abortion \\"institute,\\" and is riddled with misinformation and cleverly worded distortions. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"i'm 17 and I got this as a gift -- pretty worthless. nothing in here i didn't already know, and yeah, the dude shouldnt have made his Pro-Life opinions so obvious. he should have tried harder to be neutral. it's supposed to be for everyone going to college, not just bible thumpers."},{"rating":"2","title":"falling in love in a business marriage","review":"Efficient heroine is in a business marriage with successful & busy Hero the last 2 years. She now wants out of their marriage of convenience b/c she's in love with him & doesn't want an open marriage any longer. Hero wants to their marriage to be a real one but heroine believes it's only a ploy to continue her work as his competent personal assistant. So she invents a lover to compel him to agree to a divorce. But Hero doesn't seem upset by it & instead appears to be understanding & still willing to preserve their marriage.For a Hamilton book, this was pretty good. It had a good romance & sexual chemisty. Hero & heroine didn't fall in love at 1st sight but fell in love with each other during the time they spent during their 2-year marriage. The main characters' Big Misunderstanding & cross-purposes were emotionally-stirring. As Hamilton's usual, sex scenes were generalized.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Assume","review":"I am really sorry to have to say that this was the most aggravating book I have read to date. It took me 4 days to read it because it got so on my nerves I had to put aside. Claire is so intent on believing that her husband, on paper only, didn't care about her that she was driving herself to distraction. She couldn't or would't think that her husband loved her even after all the hints he was leaving for her. There is one line in the book where he says to her: Are you too stupid to understand? Well I have to say she was too stupid all the way through the book to realize anything about how this man felt. This is not a book I would ever recommend to anyone. And I will first really look into any more of Diana Hamilton books before I buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.25 Stars","review":"Jake and Claire have been more like business associates than a married couple for the last two years and it has been exactly as their agreement stipulated. Claire is now in love with Jake and once her compelling reason for staying in her now painful marriage are removed, she knows she must end things. She loves him too much to be near him and not have her love returned. Jake, however, foils her plans at every turn.This was an interesting book in that it was a little out of the ordinary. It was told from Claire's point of view. This was both a strength and a weakness. Not knowing how Jake felt furthered the uncertainty but it dragged on a bit in places with too much thinking on Claire's part.It was well written and emotional. I teared up a couple of times, which is a good indication of quality. The only reason I did not give it five stars was the fact that there was just a little too much thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out in a few days.","review":"First of all the lights arrived with one of the switches broken. It was always on. Not a big deal since I just unplugged the light when I didn't need it. Just the same it was annoying. I'd have sent it back, but by that point I had already put the light together and did not want to go through the hassle of taking it apart and exchanging over a broken switch.What did annoy me is the fact that both halogen bulbs that came with the light died after at most 40 hours of use.Also, the lights only tilt UP not DOWN. So if you need the lights to shine on the floor or say down into the engine bay. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ravel orchestral performances - look for the vinyl","review":"I never get tired of these wonderful performances, in which the myriad of details sparkle with excitement in exactly the right balance. Buy this economical set and fall in love with these pieces all over again (especially the perfectly graded tempi and climaxes in \\"La Valse\\"). I have two of the source LP's, and there is a slight airy sheen on the treble that, sadly, is not present on the CD reissue (apparently lost in the careful and tasteful noise reduction process - but I would rather have the hiss). Don't let that stop you from owning these must-hear recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good recording of a true classic piece","review":"It is a good recording of a truly classic piece, even though the composer himself hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awsome book!","review":"This book tought me everything a girl sturgels with and how to fix the problems! Every one should buy this book. It shows you how to handle your problems without exploding over every little thing. There are so many stories about girls who have had problems that i face in life and i learn from them mistakes instead of making them again. This book is the best book i have ever read. It talks about everything... including the serch for you intersoul and inner bueaty... ( seeing whats on the inside that counts) this book it tottaly worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In our world it is often that words can't describe the horror caused by a man to his fellowman","review":"The reality behind this story is so sad and horrifying. In terms of cinema this is a very good movie, well written, well played, well photographed. It proves again that \\"LESS IS MORE\\". Recommended !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant story of love and redemption","review":"If you like a film that reveals itself slowly, slowly, with ever more secrets filled in as you go. And watch a film again several times over, each time finding something new. A detail overlooked, despite the simplicity of the plot. An item left hanging, a word at the end easily overlooked. Haunting scenes of strange but sympathetic people, much left trailing. Not always politically correct. If somewhat amateurish cutting is something you can overlook, and a striking Norwegian incongruously given a Russian name. You will find this is a poignant love story of two people injured who find in their pain they can begin to heal the other. Highly recommended as an esthetic experience for the discerning."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Film you soon will not forget...","review":"First off, I won't go into a brief synopsis of this film. For that, see the other reviews of this fine film.What I will remark upon is the fact that this film is one of those rare pieces of work that will slowly draw you in and cause you to feel deeply for these finely written characters.If you are looking for a \\"movie\\" that goes 100 miles per hour with recklessly futile car chases, mindless profanity and nudity -- then this \\"Film\\" is not for you.If you are looking to be truly drawn into a fine story with wonderful acting so profound that you find yourself being haunted well after the final credits have rolled -- then this film is for you ! A Must see !"},{"rating":"2","title":"very deep","review":"This movie is very deep, it made me cry and think about many things...I recommend it to everyone over 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Introduction","review":"Menuhin's second mono recordings from the mid 50's are intense and technically flawless. However, he does not portray any kind of spirituality or serious profundity in this set. But he definetly puts in more emotion, expressiveness, beauty and brilliance into these accounts than in his first set (which to me are the most boring and dry readings i've ever heard!).Menuhin shows himself to be the true virtuoso, and these readings are very unique and very individual. He does reveal and give insights into many details overlooked by many other artists which is facincating and illuminating.The sound is in excellent late mono, loud, clear and warm.(My favorites are still the Perlman and the Enescu renditions.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"all talent, no technique","review":"too many intonation problems to be overheard and very difficult to make out counterpoint where its excentuation is essential. do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for a good recording of these magnificant pieces, however large a temptation Menuhin's talent may be"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to pinpoint it","review":"With \\"weird\\" music, it can be very difficult to transcend \\"something somebody made\\" to become a \\"freestanding work of art.\\" Deerhoof has some bizarre elements and riffs here strung together in a repetitive litany, failing to impress.
