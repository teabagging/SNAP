Frank Baum's books about Oz as a kid. I loved them so much I bought all the hard back editions of them. Then a few years ago I saw \\"Wicked\\" on Broadway. I loved it! So I thought I would read the book to get more of a background knowing there is much that has to be left out when a book is put into a play. Whoa! Mr. Maguire did NOT need to put all the sexual parts in this book. To me it demeaned Mr. Baum's story. What a let down. I finished the book but will never recommend it to anyone. To me it was almost trash. I liked the concept Mr. Maguire had but he really went overboard. The story would have been fine without the sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life's short, don't miss this one.","review":"Maguire has shown me the error of my ways. I had always thought Dorthy was doing a GOOD thing by killing the Wicked Witch of the West. Now I know it was all just a horrible mistake by a little girl who was completely out of her element. I very much appreciated the twist and depth to the original story that Wicked has introduced. As an earlier reviewer wrote, one of the themes in this book is that, \\"Everything is not as it seems.\\" It gives one pause to think how very much like Dorthy we are in the bigger picture of the world. I'm the type of person who thinks life is too short to re-read books; however, this one I just might."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!!","review":"The people that like this book must be the same people that like Yoko Ono and performance art. Myself and a friend from work decided to read this book together and discuss it, because we heard tons of positive hype. Half way thru we were still waiting expectantly for SOMETHING, ANYTHING to happen. I couldn't even fininsh it!(but I read most of it,)I didn't even feel compelled to finish it. This is the most overrated book I have ever come across. Easily the worst book I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 strikes, you're out","review":"Along with all the other good folks who rated this book 1 star, I found it haphazardly written, uninteresting and full of unlikeable characters.But why 2 strikes you ask me?Well, this is the second chance I give this author. I read \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" and felt much the same about it as this one. However since I had heard such glowing praise for this book I figured I simply picked a dud before and read \\"Wicked\\" hoping to understand some of the hoopla about this author. Sadly, I remain unimpressed with his work and will now proceed to never read his books again.He does pick interesting themes for his books but fails to deliver every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"It shows a completely different view of the Wicked Witch of the West from the beloved story by Baum. Maguire's brings to life a brilliant re-telling of the story of Oz with a more \\"realistic\\" view of the life in this fantasy land. The story line is imaginiative and intelligent and keeps you turning the pages. This book definitely brings to the reader's attention on \\"What is evil?\\" and keeps your mind working. This is a story you surely wouldn't want to miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From \\"Wicked\\" to \\"Wonderful\\"","review":"As a child, I enjoyed the movie and the books about Oz. I wouldn't say that I was a fanatic about them though and it was only after friends repeatedly encouraged me to read \\"Wicked\\" that I finally charged into it. I am very happy that I did. Except that Maguire occasionally gets bogged down trying to explain as a philosopher rather then demonstrate as a novelist his themes of the deceptive natures of appearances, politics, and of evil, the book was a refreshing look at a childhood pleasure. The greatest fun was reading \\"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" immediately after finishing \\"Wicked\\". I hope that I have not offended Mr. Maguire by saying that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magically Creative","review":"Gregory Maguire reinvents Oz like you've never imagined it, following Dorothy's nemesis The Wicked Witch of the West. It begins with her birth and follows her life until her fateful encounter with the little girl from Kansas.Maguire instigates an entire discussion on the nature of evil with this book. The Wicked Witch, or Elphaba as she is known comes off as a heroine through alot of the book, and some of the other classic and cherished characters such as Glinda come off as merely a petulant spoiled brat. Part of the fun of the novel is how these characters beyond Dorothy's world interact, and how the land of Oz is designed with as much if not more political turmoil than what we know in our world. Richly imagined, I found the book fascinating although I did think it dragged a bit towards the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and entertaining read!","review":"If you enjoyed the story of the Wizard of Oz, this is an excellent companion piece. In the original, you saw Oz through the eyes of a stranger, Dorthy Gale. In Wicked, you see it through the eyes of the \\"Wicked\\" Witch of the West. But more interesting, you get to know the side characters much more intimately: the Wizard, Glinda, the \\"Wicked\\" Witch of the East. You come to understand the Witch of the West's (aka Elphaba) motivations, and how misunderstandings, grudges, timing, misconceptions play an important in the \\"creation\\" of a person's identity and ultimately their life; thereby asking the question, \\"what is evil really?\\"I also felt that Maguire captured the tone and language that Baum had set in the original story.P.S. Understanding where the winged monkeys come from now, they definitely seem less scary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, vibrant characters, a fascinating book","review":"We have read most of the Oz books, and this is an excellent addition to the group. Some of the later books do hint at the \\"dark side\\" of Oz, and it is obvious that the author was familiar with these works. The movie also contributed to the picture. We loved Elphaba, but agree with some of the earlier reviewers that the ending was rushed and not quite right. We realize that the author was trying to mesh with the existing works, but it didn't quite work. Up until the very end, however, we loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it","review":"Really great idea for a book, and I would highly recommend Wicked to anyone who likes the \\"Wizard of Oz.\\" Suggested: go back and (re-)read the L. Frank Baum book after finishing Wicked.Book ideas I'll never make a million dollars from: \\"Late: The Life and Times of the White Rabbit\\" \\"Savage: The Life and Times of the Queen of Hearts\\" (Alice in Wonderland) \\"Gardener: The Life and Times of Mr. McGregor\\" \\"Silver: The Life and Times of Long John Silver\\" \\"Footprint: The Life and Times of Friday\\" \\"Swinger: The Life and Times of Cheetah\\"See also \\"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a cruel, cruel world. . . .","review":"The books of Maguire were touted as \\"reimagining of classic fairy tales.\\" Ummm. . .no. I was sorely disappointed to find that the books merely took loosely adapted generic characters from classic fairy tales, and then used them in stale, overbearingly boring political stories. I ordered Mirror, Mirror. . Wicked. . .Confessions. . .and Lost. . . and reading them was pure punishment. While well written for what they are, I suppose, they are not as described. They are not for people who love fantasy, nor are they for people who remeber the classic stories of youth with fondness. They are for people who feel the need to punish theirselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oz ain't just for kids anymore!","review":"Admit it, year after year you watched the movie The Wonderful Wizard of Oz to relive Dorothy Gale's plight over the rainbow. It, and the book is is based on, is a classic. But have you ever wondered about the other side of the story? The Wicked Witch was a person, too, and she had a life of her own worth telling. The novel Wicked recounts the events of her life--a life you would never have expected--from unfortunate birth to unfortunate death. It's touching, humorous, and a must read for any fan of the Oz stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked : A Modern-Day Tale of Evil","review":"What is the \\"Nature of Evil?\\" Is someone born evil, or is he/she shaped by their environment? Is \\"evil\\" an inherent trait, or is it just a case of being misunderstood? Does Society, as a whole, or Religion, in part, lay the foundations for the differences between Good and Evil?These are some of the questions asked, and partially answered, in this wonderfully entertaining tale of the evolution of a misunderstood young girl into one of the greatest villains of all time: the Wicked Witch of the West.The book does not pretend to have all the answers; it merely causes you to ponder the questions for a long time after the book is finished. I promise you, if read with an open mind, you will NOT look at society and religion in the same way again!Definitely a must-read for mature readers, as it delves into not only the darker side of a world we all once thought of as perfect, but into the darkness of your very being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I got about half way through this book before I gave up completely. It's slow and it's boring. I have no idea what relevance most of the sub plots have (and there are a lot of them), the characters change completely from one chapter to the next with no real reasons, and a couple of times throughout the book I felt physically sick. I only started reading it because of the musical, but it is NOTHING like \\"Wicked.\\" This book is not worth reading. Seriously, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Grand Disappointment","review":"I was the only one out of the five women in my book club to finish Wicked, and I advised them not to bother reading to the end. Gregory Maguire had such a clever idea to look at a beloved story from another angle - and he squandered it! It felt like he was trying too hard to copy Tolkien in that you had to keep checking the map to look up countries and their inhabitants. He threw in weird sexually explicit references that didnt contribute at all to the story (the one with the tiger was really weird and never explained).This book was a huge disappointment to a true Oz fan (I have read many of the Oz books in the series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish they had a zero star.","review":"I've read many many books in my time, from the classics to the strange and the new and popular.I saw a lot of people talking about this book (not the musical) and decided to see what the fuss was about.I truly wish I hadn't.I honestly didn't need to hear about a boy getting sodomized by a Tiger. (And that, is what apparently happened. As is suggested later on several times.) I'm not a prude by any means, but there was just too much sex in this book!I wouldn't be so disappointed if it had actually been honest on the cover. Reading the little descriptive blurb makes it sound a whole lot better than it was. It was about nine times longer than it had to be, dragged on and on about the stupidest things, retreaded over the same topics, never explained alot of things, and catered to just about every fetish in the world.All in all, I give it two thumbs down and warn people about buying this book for younger people. And boy, am I glad I checked it out of the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked = Disappointing","review":"I waited a few weeks after finishing this book to write my review, hoping that hindsight would soften my feelings... I'm sorry to say this, but I really hated it. Generally, stories that are adapted from novels for screen or stage get destroyed in the process. Not so here. The pointless story drags on with little direction, leaving the reader wondering when the \\"good parts\\" are going to start. Interesting plot points that were hinted at early on never get fully developed or are completely ignored, and I spent the last few hundred pages begging for the book to end. Also, this book is NOT for children...not that it would hold their attention long enough for them to get to the objectionable material."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's wicked that I read this book at all","review":"I thought the beginning of the book was fascinating and enjoyed reading about the bizarre family into which the wicked witch of the west was born. However, the plot left much to be desired from there. A few highlights kept me going, but for the most part, I felt depressed that Gregory Maguire started strong and fizzled out. I had high expectations and was continually disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hope the musical is better than the book....","review":"The concept of this book was brilliant. Unfortunately, that's where the brilliance stopped. It was at least 100 pages too long, had numerous irrelevant characters, tedious sub-plots, and included bizarre sexual scenes that were both disturbing and unnecessary. I continued to read it until the bitter end, hoping that it would somehow wrap up satisfactorily. It didn't.The good news is that I hear the musical is light, funny and engaging. The bad news is that the book is none of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark...","review":"I grew up watching the Wizard of Oz on TV every Easter and have read the book many times. I was given this book to read and had heard nothing but good reviews. I was sickened and saddened that the story fell so short of my expectations. I applaud the attempt to create a pre-story (for lack of a better word) of the Wizard of Oz but found that Wicked didn't even come close. Next time, use an original story concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could say I liked it...","review":"I tried...I really tried to enjoy this book, but after slogging through the 400 pages, I just didn't care for it.Maybe I'm simply not smart enough, but there were times when I could not follow the story at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"no pot of gold over this rainbow.","review":"Perhaps I began this book from the wrong perspective. This was a story beloved of me as a little girl. I truly looked forward to reading this as an adult to give me the Wicked Witch of the West's perspective. While the book does have it's humorous points, it is definitely fantasy. If you liked Lord of the Rings, you may love this. I was really disappointed in the whole thing. It wasn't what I expected at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's poorly written but you can't help but read until the end.","review":"The title sums it all up. I heard so many great things about the musical for this book and therefore couldn't wait to start the book. It didn't take long for me to lose interest. The writing is confusing so that the reader doesn't have a clue as to what's going on. This begins toward the beginning, when McGuire introduces the dragon clock; even after reading until the end I still don't have a clue as to the purpose of the dragon clock. In fact, I'm not even certain what it is. The book is also rather a dark twist on the movie \\"Oz.\\" There were times I thought I was reading a bad romance novel with Fabio on the cover. I gave it two stars because even with all its drawbacks I couldn't help but read until the end to find out what happens to Fabala. The premise of the story is interesting but it is not well executed. I've read \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\" and found that a more enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gregory Maguire sheds an amazing new view on Oz...","review":"Being a huge, dedicated fan of the original \\"Wonderful Wizard of Oz\\" children's classic by L. Frank Baum and it's MGM companion movie, I was slightly scared that getting to know the story through the witch's eyes would heavily twist and distort my vision of the classic. Surprisingly, this novel has done nothing of the sort... if anything, it has given me a wide new and exciting outlook on the story that I've been obsessed with since I was a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful new look at an old favorite","review":"Maguire captures a part of Oz that Baum never went into depth about -- what happened before Dorothy crash landed on the Wicked Witch?This book raises issues about morality and ethics in such an engaging manner it's almost impossible not to be pulled into the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked","review":"The book was in decent condition upon arrival. The book itself is worth the read, I enjoyed seeing the land of Oz through the prepective of the Elpahba (the wicked witch). Gregory Maguire has become one of my favorite arthors and I am now unable to put his books down."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking!","review":"Thought provoking, vocabulary stuffing, fun house mirror type look into Oz. Great read, along with Son of a Witch - much better than Broadway show! (sorry, NYC) Maguire also has a neat book that spoofs Cinderella and the 'wicked stepmother' and sisters - broaden your horizons and throw out your judgments on what you think happened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Demensional","review":"This book was just blah. There was soo much potential to make this a truly outstanding story, and instead you walk away feeling you only got half the story. The characters were one demensional, the plot seemed slow, pedantic, and irritating like a sticker in your shoe. And what was with the sex scenes? I am by no means a prude, but they just seemed so heavy handed, and you could definitely tell a man wrote them. I wanted to know more about elphaba's inner dialogue (by the way I didn't like the name because I found it detracted from the story. my mind stuttered over it whenever it was on the page. they should have just stuck with fabala.) I expected this to be a really good book. Now I'm putting it on my shelf of disappointments, right beside the da vinci code."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing; poorly conceived characters","review":"A couple of weeks ago, I was in a bookstore, and saw this book. I read the the introduction, and liked it. However, after buying the book and reading it, I feel disappointed with this novel. Gregory Maguire had a great idea to update the story of the Wicked Witch, portray her as a heroine, and give us an Oz for adult readers. However, I feel he tried to make the story too dark, and if this book is about the nature of evil, as he posits, then he sure makes some strange claims. I also found that he had a pessimistic conception of human nature. I have read authors that could portray characters (even in fantasy novels) that resembled real human beings with seemingly genuine thoughts/actions/emotions/lives; Maguire isn't one of those authors. In his world, just about everyone is corrupt. Overall, the book was just too dark and pessimistic for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"this book was the most vulgar story. Very disturbing; lot's of \\"wierd\\" sexual innuendos including beastiality. This book does not even resemble the story of Oz. It was trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece to be read","review":"this book is one of the greatest i've ever read. Elphaba is my herione in the book i don't even see her as the villian, her story is so trageic and involving, the character's are very real and come alive with the imagination of maguire, he weave's their stories together brilliantly. his discripitive outlook on good and evil that elphaba constantly struggles to understand is so deep and involving that you find yourself right next to her trying to figure it out yourself. this book is a must read for all oz fans and people who want a unique look at good and evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, intelligent read!","review":"Brilliantly written,imaginatively gripping and insightful, 'Wicked' grabbed me and kept me ever intrigued, entertained and amazed at Maguire's amazing work! So true to our world today -- yet fun! Storybook style allowed me to enjoy the message within the fun of the fantasy world! I will never see 'The Wizard of Oz' in the same way again! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"Once I had but 100 pages left to read I could not think of anything else. I read on and all the while my stomach turned because, like the movie Titanic, I knew how the story ended! However, by that point I was in love with Elphaba and dreaded the end of her tortured life. Mr. Maguire presented her as the only true character in all OZ, without pretense or prejudice. I'm on my way to rent The Wizard of OZ so that I may see it through my newfound understanding of the otherworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most misunderstood source of \\"wicked\\"ness","review":"It's finally a book where not only the goody-good side is revealed. Read about a misunderstood witch who grows up like the rest of us, but just happens not to react to things like we do. Gregory Maguire has captured a whole new meaning of wickedness and put a whole new perspective to \\"an interesting read\\". Wicked opens the door to shed light on the life of Dorothy's greatest foe, The Wicked Witch of the West!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wicked is \\"a wicked waste of time\\"","review":"I didn't like this book...I found it to be bleak, dark and boring. We all know how it's going to end, but getting there is laborious. I kept hoping it would get better, but I was disappointed - and after I finally finished it, I regretted the time I spent on it.Perhaps the musical is better, but I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"from the Italian translator","review":"I'm about to finish translating Wicked for the Italian publisher who chose to buy it, here is my opinion: parts 1 and 2 are ok, but the rest is just a deadly, endless, pointless and pretentious bore. Maguire really seems to have been paid by the word: ok, he is a really learned man, but he doesn't have a clue as to how a decent, credible and intriguing plot is built. It just doesn't go anywhere: as a normal reader, I would have dropped it long ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"great service","review":"I received the book quickly and it was in really good condition, would definitely purchase from this vendor again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable","review":"Ugh. What a terrible book. I was so looking forward to it, and I couldn't even get halfway through. I don't know what this guy was on when he wrote it, but I hope I never have any. It was a good concept, but just too weird, and not in a good way.In contrast, I am now reading his \\"Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister\\", and it's far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I got this book because I absolutely loved the musical. I loved the idea that you thought that you knew the difference between good and evil. Everything you thought that you knew is turned on its head. That's still the case with this book, but I am a fan of happy endings, and this book was missing that. I knew that the musical was loosley tied to the book, but did not realize how loosely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea and play...awful book!","review":"Honestly, I was so bored I tried to pick it up at least a dozen times over 2 months. I never made it past the first few chapters. I even tried skimming later chapters and while the story was interesting, the writing was long, drawn out and boring. I somewhat enjoyed Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister but I found it yawn-inducing as well (I did at least finish reading Confessions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope!","review":"In a nutshell... I really enjoyed the begining of the book and then started to dislike it more and more untill I just returned it without finishing it. Sorry! I thought the begining was wonderful but then it jumps so fast from her parents to her in school it seemed like 2 different books and I didn't enjoy that. What happened to her parents? Why did her mother's lover die? Did her dad ever find out about the affair? Nice try.. but just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"i can't beleive these other reviews!","review":"forget the stinking play and review the gosh darn book! the play and the book are two seperate items and rarely ever does a live production and text line up! tell us about the book and how great it was, don't complain to us about how much you thought the play was better! and if you don't like mcguire's opinions and works don't share them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had read Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister and expected this book to be as good -- frankly, I was disappointed. The book reads more like a screenplay -- it's very visual, but doesn't really go into the characters the way you would expect. If you \\"see\\" a story when you read, this works, but for me it was a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"This book had so much potential, but in the end one of the most dissappointing books I have ever read. There were so many good ideas and plot vehicles that just went no where. Build up and build up and then no resolution, in so many situations. Even the ending offers little resolution, but just feels like the author got tired of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despised it","review":"I am a voracious reader and will ordinarily finish most anything. I could not complete this book. The idea is original. The execution is poor. The narrative is choppy and the motivations of the characters make little sense. Pass this one over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Let Down","review":"Like others have mentioned, this was a love it or hate it book...I HATED it...too politically based...choppy tranisitions...no emotional involvement with any of the characters...perversion in the book really threw me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Adult Version of the Wizard of OZ","review":"I loved this book. It took me a bit to get past the language they used, but once I did it was awesome. I read it a second time just before I read the next book \\"Son of a Witch\\".I'm going to see the play next week and I can't wait!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great story, great readings, poor markings on the CD!","review":"Others have reviewed the book, so I won't go there, and the reader does a fine job, but if you are like me and tend to let your CD's get shuffled around, this isn't for you. With 20 hours, there's a lot of CD's and they aren't numbered! Unless you know the order of the chapter titles, this could get very messy unless you are careful about putting each one back before getting a new one. And on a long car trip with your eyes on the road, that might not happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two sides to every story...","review":"You know its funny while we're growing up we are always told there are two sides to every story. Hearing Elphaba's story made me look at the Wicked Witch of the West so much differently. She was not evil, just misunderstood. She was judged by her green skin instead of her personality. After traumatic events happened in her earlier life, she wants to work at making things right. However, her efforts work to no avail. Why does she go insane? Well, imagine if you had three tragedies happen to you and they involved people you loved very much. I'm sure you would probably go insane too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked is just that","review":"I was a little hesitant in starting to read \\"Wicked\\" but I'm very glad that I did. It's a very interesting, thought provoking, and fun book. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in reading about the \\"Wicked Witch of the West's\\" version of the story. Very unique"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"I have no idea what was going through people's minds when they wrote the reviews that used only one or two stars. Even three or four are depriving this book of its true status. Honestly? This is the best book that I've ever read. Sure, it may not be as sweet as honey, like you all might've hoped! But really, it had an edge that makes for a great book. All it takes to read it is a little open-mindedness. Obviously it's not going to be a good book if you try and compare it to Frank L. Baum's version - but I have news for you. It's not the same book, so live with it. 'Wicked' shows elements of the Wicked Witch that we'd never heard before. Elphaba still has her flaws, of course, but she also now has a personality, one that Baum failed to show. I think that this has been a major accomplisment of literature, and apparently the media agrees, if you were to look at the latest show on Broadway."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you're looking for a smart read...","review":"This book is for you. I was introduced to the soundtrack to the musical first and after listening to it once, i ran out and bought the book. Both had been highly recommended to me. I'm almost finished with the book now and i just can't put it down! I feel so terrible for Elphaba. Everything she tries to fix, turns sour. All she wants is to be loved and to make a difference in the world, and everything seems to backfire on her. This book really makes you think about what is good and what is evil. About ambition and need and ego. McGuire takes an old tale and puts a fresh spin on it. Oz isnt so magical after all, it has the same sociopolitical and emotional problems we all face. If you're interested in a smart read, this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Longer than I generally like but I quite liked it!!!","review":"I love how the Wicked Witch is not so much truly evil, because she can be altruistic, as much as she's really misunderstood. But in the new more Wiccan-friendly, thank the Goddess, society that we live in, aren't all Witches, bad or good, more appreciated:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never the Same","review":"After reading the book, \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" isn't the same. \\"Wicked\\" explored the Wicked Witch of the West's past to the point beyond ever imagining her to be \\"wicked.\\" Maguire does a fantastic job of creating a whole new story but also sticks to the original set up. He made me think about what really good is and what evil is just from writing about the entire background of the Wicked Witch of the West. The reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 was because this book is so overwhelming. There is so much in this book that it makes me stop and take in everything that just happened. If he would have taken more time in explaining everything that was new, the book would get 5 stars. Great book overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confusing but worth it.","review":"When the Wizard of Oz was over, who really thought more of it? Dorothy was our herione, the \\"wicked\\" witch was dead. Life in Oz was back to perfect...or so we thought.Wicked challenges the ideals set forth in The Wizard of Oz. Oz wasn't just this perfect \\"dream-world,\\" it it as corrupt as our world, and maybe even more. So, that being the case, who are the people of OZ to decide who is \\"wicked\\" or \\"good?\\" Glinda is good because she helps the \\"wizard\\" while Elphaba (the wicked witch of the west) is labelled as \\"wicked\\" because she refuses to believe in the power of the wizard, whom she obviously sees right through. Overall, the power of a corrupt society and a corrupt leader lead to the death of a misunderstood woman.

It's an interesting idea that Maguire has turned into a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what your would think...but still good","review":"I was amazed at how well Oz was described by Mr. Maguire. He takes that imaginative world created by Mr. Baum and transforms into what, it seems, Oz would be like to an adults eye.

He rather reminds me of Charles Fort as he lays out his collection of cases involving forensic science. At times he seems to embrace far from mainstream theories-- read his book Occult if you want to see how far from mainstream he can get-- but he does lay out cases from the earlier years of forensic science and cases that are not normally dealt with in the more popular books on this subject.Dated but worth a read if you are interested in the roots of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a great unit","review":"Stay away from this one and get the FVS318N instead.

He tried to tell me I should give everyone a static IP address - this was being used at a very busy gym! He then told me it could take a couple weeks to get an RMA because the engineers were really busy. I have never had a problem with them like this.

The M300 is superior to the small radios I have from Sony and GE. Much better station separation and rejection of adjoining frequencies. AM reception is very good; FM is decent, but won't pick up weaker stations that other radios in your home may get. Have not spent a great deal of time with the SW, but was able to get some stations. Sound quality is excellent for a radio of this size. While some people complain about the touchy tuning, it does take a bit of getting used to. However, it is forgiving: if you dial in 1368 for 1370 am, the sound will be fine without any sibillance.

If your station is super strong and it doesn't matter if it drifts from, say, 105.3 - 105.9 when you're trying to listen to 105.5 maybe it'll be ok for you. Then again, if your station is that strong, you could buy a $10 no-name radio. The size is nice, as is the very long extendable antenna.

I bought this to listen to local baseball games at work and to have a travel radio for AM and FM listening. I don't use the shortwave feature, so I can't comment on that performance.It uses an analog dial tuner. It is very sensitive and almost impossible to tune to the frequency. When you are able to finally get it tuned, it drifts off the frequency, whether AM or FM. The AM reception is really bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grundig - Not What It Used To Be...","review":"An annoying switching system and a too sensitive dial selector combined with poor indoor reception adds up to a mediocre radio at best.

It has clock, alarm, sleep timer functions which are good for bed time or waking up in the morning. Rotary wheels for tuning and volume control, again, good for one hand operation. If you love music, you can enjoy FM Stereo sound by using the headphones jack. The only draw back is the lack of fine tuning, so you have to train your finger to tune into your station. There is no or very little drifting for this analog tune-digital display radio as far as I know.Overall, it is a good radio around the house, garage, or travelling. I use it to listen to Voice of Vietnam (6175 kHz on shortwave band), and I don't have any problem at all, reception is clear. FM and AM are also good to listen to.It is a good choice for buying a digital display pocket radio with shortwave, Stereo FM, Clock,...and the price is about $30.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"(...)1. the sound is terrific. When you play through the earphones, the true stereo sound is something else!2. The sliding factor. Others have written about stations sliding. Where I live is a very powerful FM station that plays talk shows at night, which I enjoy. Unless I hold the radio, the station will slide. It was actually unlistenable!3. the SW picks up quite well, but also had the sliding factor. If you put the radio in a certain spot in the house and stay away from it, you might hold a station.

For that matter, it loses the signal for some unexplained reasons as well.Pretty, with nice latex case, but if you want it to FUNCTION, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad design, barely shortwave","review":"1) The design of the radio is terrible. The volume and tuning wheels, and the band-selector slider are located on the sides, so putting the radio in your pocket while listening (or not) will probably result in one or more of these things:* you will no longer be in the same band* the tuner will have moved to another part of the dial* the volume will have been raised to ear-splitting levels* the radio may have been turned off (or on).Although the tuning appears to be digital, it is analog and done with a wheel so small it is very difficult to land exactly on a station. Once there, there is no way to lock in.2) Almost no shortwave stations can be located, indoors or out. This may work better in some other locations than Colorado, but I doubt it.In short, it is no more useful than the cheap radio I had been using. It's 4 times as expensive and 4 times as heavy.

LOTS OF SUGARS, using a favorite manufacturing tactic of incorporating many different forms of sugar so that none of them will lead the ingredients list, in which ingredients are ranked by weight. If the bars were formulated with just one form of sugar, I'm reasonably sure it would be the first ingredient. They're somewhat chalky, and you need to have a lot of water to drink along with them. They will supply protein along with all that sugar, but by my standards they don't actually qualify as a 'nutrition' bar - the levels of vitamins and minerals are about nil. They're really just an energy bar with the bonus of being gluten-free, and for what they are, they're good enough.One more little piece of info: Scan the reviews.

I doubt that in Shakespeare's time they had lights. And Why on earth is it not set in Athens? It looks more like England! And the Hippolyta in this version is completely un-Amazonian. Also, if you're real familiar with the words of the play, you'll notice that they left some parts and words out of this version. But, like I said, It's a great movie, and it does say \\"based\\" on the Play by W.S., so they didn't >have< to follow it exactly.And I will say that Kevin Kline was wonderful in this, as well as Calista Flockhart (albiet pulling off the 'Desperate Helena' part perfect!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing version, Great for Classroom","review":"This is a great supplement for anyone teaching Shakespeare Comedies.

Little was done to at ALL express the characters of Demetrius and Lysander, I got no feel for them whatsoever in the movie... their characters did not show through at all. Hermia was wonderful, she played the role fabulously. Calista Flockhart, however, did not do the part of Helena justice. She whined throughout the whole thing, making Helena two dimensional and annoying. (although, I must say I'm rather critical of her because after being Helena in a play of MND myself, I've learned a lot)Many important parts of the script were cut out, which left the play lacking in many important aspects.

Leaden, pedestrian, turgid and utterly without charm, this goes on my list of the ten worst movies I've ever seen. Whose idea was it to try to turn Bottom into a sullen whiner? Why is it obligatory for him to writhe around with Titania? Was it necessary to film it in the basement of Studio B? Spare yourself. Don't waste your time on this trash; rather, get the 1935 version.

The time period this film was set in fits the story quite well. This film made me laugh & cry. Since the first time I watched it which was last weekend, I have watched it about 20 more times.

Saw it in the theater and I don't think I even crack a smile once the whole entire movie. It was pleasant, charming and occasionally good-humored.

My wife and I made it through 10 minutes of this DVD before we had to shut if off. This just isn't how we want to spend our \\"down time\\" on a Friday evening. I needed subtitles just to keep up with the dialog. We definitely were drawn to the MSND by the cast, all of whom had made movies we really enjoyed, but this movie belongs in an acting class (if you really believe great actors need to perform Shakespeare). Now we aren't complete snobs about these types of movies. We really enjoyed Mel Gibson's Hamlet, but I felt like I was back in high school while watching a MSND, trying to find the relevance of being exposed to this material. Maybe it gets better as it goes on, but unless you're prepared to take notes and rewind to catch the dialog, I'd pass unless you're a real Shakespeare buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Midsummer NightMear","review":"I seen this movie last year when it came out in the Theater.\\"Matrix\\" was already showing,so we settled for this film. I love Michelle Pfeiffer,and Kevin Kline has always been one of my favorite actors. When the film started,I knew from the begining this was a mistake. If I had a choice,I'd rather have my Wisdom teeth pulled without novacane.I would have walked out of the film,but I was on a date and didn't want to be rude.The happiest day of my life is when I saw,\\"The End.\\"If anyone wants life to slow down,rent this video.Two hours will seem like a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty cool","review":"Nor a fan of Shakespeare, but i was able to enjoy this movie, helped a lot eith assignment of reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A misbegotten \\"Night's Dream\\"","review":"Can Shakespeare's most magical play stand having all the magic taken out if there are at least pretty people playing the parts? I'm sorry, but no. Some have complained about the mud fights and nudity that pervade the film, which are not really a problem in a convention-defying play such as this, but every major role is so miscast as to make this movie nearly unwatchable.The main culprit is Calista Flockhart, who has to stop McBealing her way through every role she gets. Stanley Tucci does an adequate job of acting but physically is about the last person who should play Puck. Michelle Pfeiffer and Rupert Everett do a fair job as Titania and Oberon, but as usual it's Kevin Kline who chews up the Tuscan scenery and steals the show with gusto.The worst mistake for a movie about enchantment is to be mediocre and ordinary. You just won't remember this \\"Dream\\" for very long after it's over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Updated Version of Classic","review":"I watched this again because it is a fun updated version of the play.

Ancient Athens meets fairlyland, which in turn meets Elizabethan tradespeople-turned-thespians...adding layers of 19th century Italy to the mix, and bicycles, and windeup gramophones, and a repetitive recycling of Italian opera's greatest hits on the soundtrack, just muddies things up. Lots of money went into this production, and it does have some nice visuals. But there is no genuine artistic vision here. Less would have been more. The two stars are for the director's concept, not for author William S., whose best lines are just about impossible to ruin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Scenery, Horrible Actresses","review":"MSND is one of my favourite plays of the Bard, behind 12th Night. This adaptation ranks very poorly among the movie canon of the Bard. The Tuscany setting was gorgeous. I'll even give it that the male actors were good. Everett was an excellant Oberon. Tucci surprised me by turning in a decent Puck. But the female actresses were utterly, horrifically deplorable. If you are going to change the setting (location) of a Shakespeare, at least be consistent! Every time I heard \\"Athens\\" I wanted to scream. Athens is in Greece NOT, NOT, NOT Italy. You might as well have changed the town's name the discrepancy was so blarring blatant. Others have mentioned some of the subtleties that this adaptation missed. After a while you just get used to the fact that everyone corrupts Shakespeare these days. The poor Bard must be rolling in his blessed Stratford-upon-Avon grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disliked it five years ago, still don't like it today!","review":"Saw this when it first came out and hated it; watching it again, in hopes of using it in a class, and again I find it tedious and uninspired. It has all the right parts, in terms of actors (though I must confess to disliking Stanley Tucci's Puck), but the conception is busy, pretentious, and sadly missing the spirit of the play! As another reviewer said, if you haven't read much Shakespeare or seen much on stage, you may like this film. If you have read Shakes, and seen good stagings of this and other plays, you'll find it to be two very tedious hours. I still think I\\"ll use part of it in class, though, in comparison with at least one other filmed stage performance (the Royal Shakespeare Company's), just to spur discussion about updating and interpreting Shakespeare!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bicycles?","review":"I read all the reviews on this site and couldn't wait to get my copy. My grandson and I have enjoyed Midsummer Nights Dream video many, many times. Our version was made in 1935 and starred Hollywoods best at that time, like Mickey Rooney, at age 11, Jimmy Cagney and many others. I would advise all to rent both that version and this version before you purchase. I didn't care for this one at all, and I wouldn't show it to my grandson. The story was not presented well, the music almost non existant, and that aging Puck, well, even Kevin Kline couldn't make me keep this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare for Dummies??","review":"Ok, so it's not exactly true to Shakespearean theatre, but it's a very fun film! The cast is perfect & really makes A Midsummer Night's Dream a delight. My teenage daughter has been trying to study Shakespeare and finds it difficult reading, but movies like this have helped her to understand the entire storyline, this making reading his work a lot easier. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the change in time periods; That was unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enchantment!","review":"I have never read or seen the play from which this movie was derived. I love the airy, fairytale feel of the movie. I especially like Calista's and Michelle's characters. I enjoyed the enchantment of it all, and specially the moment when they awaken, naked and next to each other, and are found by their parents, it's so funny. Other reviews rant about how it is a good or bad adaptation to the play, however from an unbiased point of view for not reading the original play, it is a great movie. Truly a movie for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"magical","review":"this is the only version of mnd that brings out the magic, enchantment, and humor of shakespeare's play. and i've seen 3 different versions, incl the rsc film (93). this is the only one where i consistently laughed out loud. only gripe about the movie was the performance of clarissa lockhart whose performance was uneven, sometimes good but too often wooden. the fellow who played the duke wasn't so great, either, but luckily he had a small part.wonderful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone interested in Shakespeare","review":"This film is fabulous for anyone that takes a liking to Shakespeare. The interpretation of the play is wonderful, well-thought, and easy to understand. This would be a good film to present to a class studying Shakespeare or literature, because the translation of the play into film is easy for even the most illiterate to understand"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare Rolling in Grave For Some Choices in Film","review":"For anyone who has read this play or seen any true performance of this play, there are some shockingly odd things about this movie. The producers' first mistake was updating the play to the 19th century. The work was meant to be played out in ancient Greece and in the fairy world of that time period. The most outlandish use of poetic license was when Puck (actor/director Stanley Tucci) was taking his ride on the bicycle. It seemed very out of place for this mythical creature to be doing this.I do agree with the other reviewers that this movie was excellent eye candy and that even the lesser talented actors shine in this film. Besides, how can you go wrong by glittering up Michelle Pfiffer? Three stars for Shakespeare's words and one more for the excellent performance of the play-within-the-play near the end of the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bedtime book","review":"I received a copy of this book from a book club before my daughter turned two. It was immediately one of her favorites and we read it so much we both (still) have it memorized.She's almost out of high school now but recently had surgery.

Of course this cd does not have a lot of singles. It only has Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Money Changes Everything. But the others are a nice compilations of songs that she likes and some are not that bad. When You Were Mine is a great song form her debut album that was written by Prince.

(If so, was she in the midst of morning sickness at the time?) It contains mostly songs that were fillers from other albums. \\"Dancing With a Stranger\\" and \\"Dear John\\" are Cyndi at her worst. The other songs (with the exception of \\"Money,\\" \\"Girls,\\" \\"When U Were Mine\\" and \\"Someone Like Me\\" -- all gems) are mediocre. Cyndi's newer material is much stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another greatest hits album...already?","review":"I bought this album last year at Sam Goody for about eight bucks. I bought it before looking at what the contents were...because I am a devoted Cyndi Lauper fan, which is kind of weird being that I have not even reached the tender age of 17...but will before the month is up. This album contains most of the songs that are on twelve deadly cyns...however I like this album better because of the slight differences in songs and patterns, segueys from song to song, and the overall mood of the album. Over all the songs that were picked for this album were not all the ones that got critical acclaim or any at all. They were and are the songs theat the artist (Cyndi herself) has chosen because they mean something special to her. All in all I believe that as far as a greatest hits album it does its job pretty well. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!!!!!!","review":"Got it excellent shape and best of all it wasn't fake!!!!

In the notes to the combined re-issue of RCA recordings \\"No Place to Fall\\" and \\"Renegade Picker\\" his praises are sung by no less than Townes Van Zandt, Waylon Jennings and Lucinda Williams.

As an avid music fan, I never missed Christina Aguilera (though i wish i had), AC/DC, Tori Amos, Adam & the Ants, America, Paul Anka, the Archies and so many of the other artists mentioned in this book beyond the \\"A\\" section of the index. I don't necessarily blame the book, for the average American sheep plumping on a steady major label spoon-feeding of aural air biscuits this is probably much more interesting, and the teen dreamer dying to pick up the \\"lost\\" Aguilera material will be elated. For anyone who's looked beyond, followed and taken an interest in music, this will make a good coaster.

This was a very entertaining read, reminded me of Camus or her longtime companion Sartre except at a much faster clip. It's about a man stuck in a crisis of identity and purpose and his past. It's a little florid, and, there is a focus on certain historical figures that I'm not sure really do the book a great deal of benefit, but overall, it's very well written and a fun read which is kind of not what I was expecting from an Existentialist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your time","review":"I purchased this book to suppliment a class I teach in Microprocessors.

If you cant find those things out anywhere else, then buy it (it got me building hardware and writing code)but I suggest looking online first.

And Markus Guentner's _Lovely Society_ has all of that going for it. \\"All of the Time\\" starts off with a Herbert-like rhythm, but quickly finds its own moody voice (with Heiko Badje's own modulated and processed voice). Renato Figoli later switches up \\"All of the Time\\" to a major key, making it lighter and more spry. \\"Something About You\\" drifts through with its own mellow mood, while \\"Back in the Days\\" doesn't have as much as a retro feel as one would expect. In fact, if anything sounds like a throwback, it would be \\"Swap,\\" with its chunky synths, or \\"On My Mind,\\" which takes on an electro vibe.

This CD includes 13 of the band's past hits and 1 new single \\"Te Llevare Al Cielo\\". It also includes the video for \\"Eres Mi Religion\\", which was the second single of their album \\"Revolucion De Amor\\".

Many people have overcome same-sex attraction and moved on with their lives.

Do the math! That translates to 886 Miles Per Hour - well over the sonic barrier (500 to 700 MPH depending on altitude and barometric pressure).You can suppress the blast, but when you do, you still hear the crack as the bullet breaks the sound barrier.A few other cartridges that are super-sonic are: 9MM, Super 38, .357, .41Mag and .44 Mag. So how do you totally eliminate any tell-tale sound? Use a lower velocity cartridge.As a rule of thumb, don't use a revolver; you should use an automatic pistol. The ideal pistol: .380 AUTO.One other thing to consider. Silencers are illegal. If you are caught you could be shot or embark on an extended vacation at Club Fed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comments on the Meditations","review":"I have used this book extensively in my personal and professional life. I find the meditations soothing and extremely helpful in focusing my energy and my thoughts. I also use the meditations in this book in professional counseling practice and my clients find these mediations very beneficial to their growth and healing. What I especially like about this book and the 2 other meditation books, Meditations for Healing and Meditations for Awareness is that they include a variety of authors. This inclusion of many authors I believe helps to expand the consciousness of the reader and increase the flow of energy during the mediation. I would highly recommed these books. I have purchased many copies of these books as gifts of healing, awakening and transformation for family and friends.

It's concise and easy to understand for the novice (me). It probably shouldn't be a book for advanced UML architects.The tone of the book is nice, connecting the abstract concepts of UML modeling to practical situations. Unlike some other UML books, this one avoids the \\"religous\\" indocrination -- the idea that you MUST do UML a certain way, or adhere to 101% of the standard. Instead, the author shows examples of how you can be more productive by relaxing a little and applying only as much rigor as necessary.Highly recommended to anyone who wants to augment their skills as a system architect, and prepare sophisticated plans for implementing an object-oriented application."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent introduction","review":"This book gets right to the point and for the most part avoids religious arguments. Unlike many writers on info tech philosophies and tools, Fowler doesn't exaggerate the advantages of the topic or underrate alternatives -- he just gives you straight facts and honest evaluations.

Compared to 2nd edition, 3rd edition has lots of Martin's experience sharing. This is not a bad thing. But for a beginner of UML, what he wants is to quickly understand UML instead of Martin's experience.For example, Martin tells readers that you should focus more on text description other than UML use case. Also, for the other example, in Chapter 14 Component Diagrams, it is full of Martin's opinion about how to use Component Diagrams without telling readers what is the definion of Component Diagrams.If you are a new beginner of UML, go back to buy 2nd edition. If you are the readers of 2nd edition and would like to know Martin's experience, then 3rd edition can be a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal book for UML begginers/intermediate","review":"Very easy book to read.

There is as much information about Fowler's favorite ways to write incorrect UML as there is about how to write correct UML.

I think I tried reading it about three times and never got past page four. It's both boring beyond comprehension and confusing beyond comprehension.

She's beginning to come out of her shell, thanks to Darci, Rick, and Abby, but unfortunately still finding dead bodies. The mystery involving the pig farm is great to me, I don't know why I liked it so much. As for the rest of the mystery, I found the villian's backstory as somewhat outlandish but it works and I like his methods for the story so I'm not going to nag about it. The information about the witch trials and runes was also really cool to learn. I felt like Comacho was just a red herring as a possible love interest for Ophelia, especially since she dislikes him with such vehemence in the beginning and Rick is out of the picture. Bill is as funny as ever as he threatens Ophelia with jail time for her \\"bumbling\\". Can't wait for the next!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I really liked the first book and was looking forward to the second one.

William Regal has overcome so much, alot due to his own mistakes and personal tragedies and problems, but you cannot held but admire this man when you read this book and see how he turned his life around and became the man that he is today, sure he might not be at the spot on the card he most deserves to be at, which is certainly at the top! But he still delivers in that ring and on the microphone. William Regal never stops entertaining me, me being a fan of British humour, growing up with a great deal of it in my family, due to my mother being from Scotland, I appreciated reading a book like this. I loved how he held nothing back and was honest as they come, whether it be about drugs, life, or whatever, he was blunt as hell. William Regal, I was already a fan of yours, but after reading this book, you have made me a much bigger fan, for life! Much respect to you sir!-JPM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good biography!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. It's about the life of Darrin Matthews, who plays William Regal on the WWE. It talks about how he got involved in wrestling. He went through some ups and downs in his life. He use to be a drug addict and it nearly ruined his life and those around him. He tells on why you should never do drugs in the first place. I also like him as a wrestler on the WWE. I liked it when he would team up with Eugene to win the tag teams titles. He also did that with another wrestler named Tajiri.

That's basically it for this game.I can see where kids would enjoy this simple & cute game. The graphics are nice and in 3D.

I thought I was buying a Dylan biography but was greatly disappointed. In case others may be misled by the packaging please know that the author is so devoted to adulation of socialist/communist/left wing politics that Bob Dylan the person, songwriter, musician and performer is definitely secondary. Although the book was reasonably well-written and appears to have been researched the author's unwavering obsession with politics and his overt political bias is quite annoying.

For a book the Church of Scientology pushes heavily, it's pretty awful. Almost all the 'sections' are preachy, most of the insights are unoriginal, and there are a few things which are patently offensive. For example, in one passage, \\"The Vocabularies of Science\\", Hubbard calls Japanese a \\"baby talk language\\" and proceeds to espouse his almost complete ignorance of the language. I find it difficult to believe the CofS includes that in their translations for prospective Japanese scientologists. On the other hand, if you think Japanese is a baby talk language, and also believe some of the other bizarre assertions in this book, maybe scientology is for you... In sum, I cannot fathom why any thinking person would join the CofS as a result of reading this book. Lousy, preachy, ignorant, and boring. To put it bluntly, a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good photography, annoying narration and distractions","review":"For those of you looking for something in the mold of Planet Earth, Life of Mammals, and Life in the Freezer, you are going to be deeply disappointed. The first 20 minutes of the feature is a lecture on global warming, with excessive amounts of coverage of humans studying the arctic ice. The second half actually features \\"the Masters of the Arctic Ice\\", but the narration seems more interested in rambling about climate change than actually providing insight as to what is occurring with the animals. If you are a fan of stern global warming lectures, you will love this. If you actually wanted to learn about the animals, there are easily a dozen better DVDs you should view first.This is a true shame, as it has some of the best film yet of seal and polar bear dens.

This debut sounded great on cd to begin with and the sweet sound of vinyl presents it in its best form. The vocal harmonies seem to stand out more, the noises and effects and details all seem to find their place (not buried)---all to make this one of the more enjoyable psychedelic, folk-fed experimental trips you can take on wax.

THe other bad thing is that the rectangular viewfinder is totally offseted(not centered) in the viewfinder window, which means I can only see the above two angles of the rectangular viewfinder and the circle(I don't know how to call that) which is supposed to be in the middle is in the southeast.

They are far more interesting than todays so called wild life shows, as they concentrate on the wild life and not some self centered celebrity host (no offence to the memory of the late great Steve Irwin). Now to the \\"but...\\" part. Does anyone else but me find that Disney did a LOUSY job on the packaging? Cheap cardboard and plastic containers, that cannot be displayed properly on a bookshelf with the other Disney Treasures! What was wrong with the original clamshell cases?

But what I will not take is the form of animal abuse that was put into this movie. What people don't know is that Disney paid kids in Churchill, Manitoba, to catch lemmings, then transported them to non-habitat in Alberta where a turntable flung them off a cliff and into \\"the sea\\" by the dozens. See for yourself: [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disney approves mass lemming murder","review":"Ever since \\"The Jungle Cat\\" aired on Wonderful World of Disney when I was a child, I have been trying to acquire more of these wonderfully photographed wildlife \\"documentaries\\" in the True-Life Adventure Series. They are obviously staged, but well done for the times. So why only 2 stars? Another reviewer has written that Disney does not discuss the fact that they killed a few dozen lemmings in the making of \\"White Wilderness.\\" It is not confirmed that Disney knew what the principle photographer was doing, but it seems that, if that were the case, they would not be afraid to discuss the issue. I am not buying this volume, as I would never want my children to learn myths (that lemmings commit suicide) about the animal kingdom, and I do not want Disney to think that I condone what they did. For more information about \\"White Wilderness\\" and the forced lemming suicide, see [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Adventure DVD","review":"Could you rate it a 10 or 100. Who couldn't love Disney's True Adventures. Yes, there is even a whole channel for animal adventures now, but they were the first--and they were the best. They are pack in a great package; durable and imaginative. The added interviews and backstage scenes are great. I can remember seeing them on their program (in black and white) when I was in first grade. They are wonderful. It was a treat to learn about the couple who filmed them too. Spending years and years filming things they thought was funny or interesting. Then bringing them back and someone putting them together into a story that is loved forever. I have all four of them. And we watch them over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"They teach kids to love nature","review":"I've read the criticisms of these sets, and agree that many scenes are probably staged, some to the detriment of the animals. However, the True Life adventures are well done and loved by children and adults. They are not preachy and they do not tell us of the evils of man. They simply encourage a love of nature and the wonderful world God has given us. Kids will hear about the way mankind has misused nature from other sources and because of the love of nature they developed, in part, from this series, perhaps they will be motivated to do something about it. I wish the execs at Disney would create more just like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Disclosure","review":"The book was in excellent condition.

Gable plays a stuffy Bostonian lawyer, in Naples to meet the young son of his dead brother. He quickly forms an attachment to little Nando (played winningly by Marietto) however his Aunt Lucia (Loren) refuses to let him take the child back to the States. As you might expect however, the charm of Capri soon works it's magic and the pair find love in the final reel.Sunny funny romance. This is probably one of Sophia's best pictures of the time. As Lucia, a stunning uninhibited cabaret star, she gets to show off her seldom-utilised musical skills performing several numbers including \\"(You Wanna Be) Americano\\". Though Loren and Gable are somewhat lacking in the chemistry department, the movie as a whole is lovely.

When I looked at some of the prices for a circular polarizer, I was shocked back to the '80's. I decided to go with a Sunpack and for the price and I am very pleased. It does what is supposed to do and is well made. I also got a Sunpak UV filter and a non-Canon extra battery for the XS for around $33 for the battery and the 2 filters.

I bought a Marumi instead and the difference in quality is astounding. I wish I never bought the Sunpak."},{"rating":"1","title":"That's Why It is Cheap","review":"It's cheap for two things:1. A good filter would only block the polarized light, reduce the reflection. This cheap filter has its side effects by shifting the color cast to blue at maximum point and then to greenish when rotated for another 180 degrees.2. A good filter would almost completely block out polarized light at maximum. You can test it in front of a bright LCD monitor and at maximum, a good CPL filter will go completely dark. This cheap filter will only block half; you can still see what's on the LCD screen (and like mentioned above, it's blue tinted too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never again","review":"This filter is not at all what I had expected.

The vocals can be a little nice at times, but the music is the jam. What you'll find here sounds pretty different to what MC/DJ teams were doing at the time and is more musically akin to the cutting edge robotic techno pop of Kraftwerk and Art of Noise. The majority of the album is strong and aggressive save for the dreadfully lame love song Dear Tracy (yeah, thanks L.L.) and the corny but likeable Simple Simon, which sounds like a goofy olympics theme. The MegaMix at the end of the album is mind bogglingly well pieced together and in my opinion gets the slight nod over Mantronix's previous MegaMixes. This album is well worth re-releasing.

But frankly Fresh is a new company and has bred its buiseness on bringing quirky Japanees games to the US. And I believe this game qualifys. It doesn't use \\"new age\\" synthosised (sp?) music, oh no, it sticks to great classics that formed music. All the great composers of way back when that invented notes and rhythm, to the extent of music itself. I found myself almost instantly addicted to it. I would of liked it to be a bit longer, right now its at a good \\"rental\\" length, but no matter where I went, no movie rental place had it. So I bought it. And I am pleased with it. It offers a challenge, not to mention humous backround animation. Of course you cant really look at the backroud until you have mastered the song so you dont have to consentrate on it fully.

Well, you can use \\"Mad Maestro\\" as proof that 1: video games don't have to be violent to be fun and 2: that video games can enrich someone's cultural vocabulary. The graphics aren't the best and the audio is MIDI-based (it has to be MIDI otherwise the game would be very difficult to code), but that doesn't drag the game down too much. You spend so much of your time keeping the beat that you don't notice that stuff. The game has a good cross-section of famous and unfamiliar songs. Now if you want a game that is a detriment to society and incites violence, just look for any game that has the same name as a movie or singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique game","review":"I found it really hard to get the \\"pressure\\" of pushing the buttons down.

Some people cannot get past the lack of dice, which is fine, everyone has different tastes.Basically, the game is based around having scores in stats, your roleplaying ability, and dirty tricks up your sleeve. When, say, swordfighting someone, the better swordsman should win, barring complications like a dirty trick you have up your sleeve - and how you roleplay.This makes the game very roleplaying-intensive - and is detrimental to hack and slash month haul games.

This topic is more timely than ever, with Japanese public opinion flexing its muscle in foreign policy by deflating the recent movement for constitutional revision or reinterpretation, and by reigning in efforts by hawkish elites to involve the Japanese military in overseas combat operations. A co-edited volume authored by Robert Eldridge and myself explores how Japanese public opinion has shaped Japan's response to the war on terrorism.

The style is early Lee, tight, girlish and true. The arrangements are slight, and it all sounds as though it had been recorded in their front parlour. A song or two even fades out in the middle. Too bad. The engineering is off. They are both first class musicians, and deserved better care in the presentation especially in such an early record of their work. Dave Barbour, as we all know, never seemed to have grown as a musician; drink took him down with it.

However, single coated filters will turn into glare city any time you are shooting in lower light where light sources are visible in your picture.With this filter (and single coated filters from other brands), you get green dots whenever you're out at dusk or at night and point the camera at anything involving a light source, such as a street lamp, a marquee, etc. On a recent trip to Disney World, this ruined so many otherwise perfect night shots.These things are not expensive. Do yourself a favor. Spend twice as much and get a Hoya or B+W filter instead. Make sure it's multi-coated. This way, when you point the camera at or around a light source at night, instead of green dots you will see no glare.

He also throws you the occasional curve (St. Stephen's eyebrow?) when you least expect it and you come to look forward to those.He wraps up the story with a great twist of revenge then closes with a philosophical cliff hanger that makes you think about the resolution long after you've closed the book.To sum up, \\"God Doesn't Shoot Craps\\" is fast, philosophical and just plain fun...a great \\"read\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entertainment","review":"This book is a fast read with a very entertaining, funny story.

It was a surprise gift for my boss and he got the greatest kick out of it. all of other fellow coworkers were in stitches when the crazy, clucking, wacky chicken went into it's act, and boy did it squawk when you pull its neck.

It was during the Jazz Fusion era of the '70's that I became a Jazz fan. To me, just as fans point to the Cool era, or the Bop era as being significant, I feel the music created by Ronnie Laws, Hubert Laws, Donald Byrd, Stanley Clarke and others of this era, stands the test of time. This CD is an excellent introduction for those who want to know what I'm talking about.

He showed them off to the point where the other fish ignored him and thought he was snooty. He gets advice and decided to share his scales with the other fish. In this 2nd addition the schools of fish with the shiny scales are playing and a small yellow fish asks to play. Since his scales are dull, they say no. All of the sudden a shark comes looking for food and the small yellow fish is out in the open all alone. Rainbow Fish knows what he must do!It's a good lesson for younger children to learn from. About sharing, accepting, and so on. I would definitely recommend it to parents looking for good children stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rainbow Fish to the Rescue ~ Marcus Pfister","review":"This is a good childrens book on teaching kids how to behave. Children do not know how to behave properly. But when you tell them through books, and use characters like Rainbow Fish, then it is easier for them to understand. It is a great book for kidst o read to understand how to expect peoples differences. Everyone is different in their own ways, it is just harder for some people to realize it. Everyone has their own special qualities, people just need to learn that we are all different.I like this book because things like this hapen in everyday life. Rainbow Fish is a good example of how people follow others, and do not think for themselves. When one other the other fish is not excepted becasue he is a little different, Rainbow Fish doesn't know how to react. But, he learns to stand up for himself and learns how to treat others. I think everyone should learn to try to except everyone. We are all same, yet we are all different."},{"rating":"1","title":"slick special fx toolkit","review":"I Bought this used threw amazon.

I had to help her solve the first 5 or so puzzles, but after that, she got VERY excited and started to solve them without me in the room.This is a visual logic puzzle game: How can George get to the top of the building, using just the short ladder, the trampoline and the bowling ball? Put the ladder in front of the mailbox, and George will climb the ladder, jump down to the trampoline and bounce up... you get the idea. It's \\"The Incredible Machine\\" meets \\"Putt-Putt\\" and it works.The look on her face when she solves just one of the 50 puzzles was worth the cost of the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one complaint","review":"My 5-year-old son loves this program.

Very well designed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, except for the booster code","review":"My son got this for his 4th birthday, and he loves it. It's alot like Incredible Machine, which was a really fun game. He plays it all by himself and has beaten almost every level. The booster code thing is quite lame, and of course young children might feel bad not getting to play part of their game. I think the game is quite nice without the extra free play levels, and I would recommend it for advanced preschoolers to much older kids. My husband and I got into a debate over which items to use on one of the levels. Lots of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My nephew really loves this!","review":"My nephew loves the Curious George books and this game makes him feel like he's playing with one of his favorite friends!

The program can be frustrating in how narrow the acceptable area is to successfully place the many objects George needs to employ to complete his Rube-Goldbergian journeys. If your child isn't already very good with a mouse, this game will prove frustrating. Often the physics just makes no sense. My 4-year-old son couldn't understand that the program was asking him to put a trampoline on top of a light pole -- because he knew that wouldn't work. This from a kid who thinks you can build a working space shuttle out of cardboard boxes. We spent most of our time clicking on the \\"hint\\" icon that shows you where the props need to be placed and just plopping them down accordingly. Pretty much not the point!

It is just wonderful - beautiful, beautiful music. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the hype, this is great music","review":"Try not to think about the cheesy \\"Andre Rieu in Tuscany\\" PBS special. This is a very pleasing program of selections of great romantic melodies, beautifully arranged. Few people are going to purchase a CD of Dvorak's Rusalka just to hear \\"Song to the Moon\\" so this is the place to hear it. And it's even better on Rieu's violin than in the original vocal version. Rieu plays perfectly in tune (not always easy in the higher registers of the violin) and has exquisite phrasing that brings out the musicality of even the most over-recorded selections.Rhieu's arrangements (with Jo Huijts) have hints of \\"beautiful music\\" (think Ray Coniff) but only hints, and the result is very tasteful. For example, the piano obligato under the strings on \\"O mio babbino caro\\" makes you wish that Puccini had thought of that.This is a wonderful album to listen to while relaxing and would make a great gift for someone who appreciates classical music but doesn't have specific preferences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario, Good? or Bad?","review":"This game rules!

It is a challenging game and I have spent about 20 hours on it and have still not completed it.

The game does not save which means it is more than likely a bootleg copy.

The sound is just as good, it moves faster and smoother, better graphics (MUCH BETTER), new powers and abilities, new types of stars, lots of bunny rabbits to catch, and more! It's an amazing game and is a great demonstration of what the DS can do. You can play as Mario, Yoshi, Luigi, or Wario - the whole gang!

Super Mario 64 is a really entertaining and fun game, but is does have errors. In my opionion this is the best DS game yet, but there is a lot of repeats from the N64 version. As usual Princess Peach as been captured by Bowser and it's up to you to save her as one of four characters; Mario, Yoshi, Luigi, or Wario. You travel to diffrent worlds in Princess Peaches castle looking for stars to open the door where Peach is being held.PROS:The game will keep you busy for awhile.The minigames will never get old.The wireless multiplayer is a really cool feature.There are thiry more stars than there where in the first game.Good use of touch screen.You can play as Wario, Yoshi, and Luigi too.CONS:Controlls are really hard to get a hang of at some points.It's mostly the same as the N64 version.It can get a little hard and boring on some stages.In conclusion if you just got a DS or planning to get one this is the game to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great","review":"Purchased for my 7 year old Granddaughter for Easter.

The game plays about the same as the original 64 version with improvement on the original graphics and there are many added changes and improvements over the original.

It has really addicting mini games, the touch abilety is awesome. And you have a choice if you want to use the buttons for controlls, or the touch screen. I prefer the bottuns because then you have abilety to jump and stuff like that. They have a map at the touch screen to tell you where you are. They have a bottun (R) where if you press it then the camra will go right behind the charicter you are. Or on the touch screen (easely reacheble with your thumbs) their are errows so you do not have to go right behind the charicter, if you want to you can go beside your charicter.

I love how you can play as Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi. Instead of having 120 stars to collect, you now have 150 to collect. Mario 64 DS also has minigames!! Running through the painting worlds is so much fun!!! Nintendo really went the extra mile to make this game better than the original. This game is not too easy and not too hard.

But Super Mario 64 DS is still a DS game worth buying. If you don't have the original Mario 64, then definately buy this game (or get Mario 64 on Wii's Virtual Console, like I did). The controls are certainly a bit awkward. 3D Platformers should never be controlled without an analog stick. 30 new stages, 3 new characters, and a bunch of mini-games that use the touch screen are the best reasons to purchase the game if you already own the original. Improved graphics and sound make the game good.

The author jumps from one time setting to another so often, it gets totally confusing! Also she intertwines different stories of different family members and other people in her life, that it's easy to confuse the characters.

This and the author's follow up book, The Fibromyalgia Advocate cover just about all aspects of FM in greater or lesser thoroughness. The book is based mostly on empirical information and experiences, but most fibromyalgia patients relate to it with a sigh of relief and comment, \\"I'm not the only one who experiences this!\\".My only criticism is that there is too much information in it for alot of FM sufferers to digest, and can confuse one as to how to prioritize the treatments. It is a welcome aid as a self-help and reference manual and I use it as such.

High drama, but not very inspiring. Many books have been written since this publication that are far more useful (and informative) to those of us trying to guide our way through the many difficulties of this disease.

While some of her basic facts on the disease are accurate, she does her readers a great disservice (ESPECIALLY being a doctor) by portraying this condition as something that practically ends your life. It is true that when you first \\"develop\\" fibromyalgia, it is a bit overwhelming, but, contrary to what Dr. Starlanyl \\"explains,\\" there is A LOT you can do to VASTLY improve your symptoms -- to the point, in fact, that you can get your life COMPLETELY back.

It has cleared up a lot of questions I had and I like that it's a more technical type of explanation. It has pictures of the body and muscles along with trigger points.

This book identifies and breaks down all of this information in an easy to follow format (alot of medical terminology, but read it thru a couple of times, you'll get it). I actually took it with me to see my doctor, with hi-lighted areas, to point out that what I'm going thru is an actual \\"condition\\".

In my opinion the lift should be a good 2 inches longer and should gradually taper, like a door stop. It drops off too abruptly and causes my arch to be elevated to the point that it does not touch the arch support in the sandal. Also it did not stick to my sandal for very long.

I am now trying to find a copy to buy. I live in the midwest and love trains, and liked \\"Driftless Spirits\\" so much that I purchased \\"Snow On The Rails\\" without even glancing inside it. What a mistake! Most of these railroading stories could be excellent, but every one that I have read is full of obscenities and other vulgarisms. Plus explicit descriptions of lesbianism in at least two of them. \\"Driftless Spirits\\" contains nothing like this. The really sad part is that these stories could be told without these vulgarisms. They add nothing, in my opinion. I suppose that today, many people believe that such things add \\"realism\\" and \\"character\\" to a book.

Geoffrey the robot is very attractive and the more she ratchets up his abilities, the more is revealed about the conflicts between men and women, the expectations we demand of each other that even a robot can never fully deliver.The film is tongue-in-cheek, but harrowing and sad too.

It picks up dirt and large particles of matter before scrubbing with the Clorox cleaning solution. I was skeptical about the drying ability but the Scooba did a siphoning motion and sucked up the used cleaning solution. It took about 40-45 minutes (which I think is standard but I'm not sure yet) for the Scooba to mop and dry our 11 by 13 kitchen.

Easy to clean. I have a dog so I do swifter first to get hair so that I do not have to clean so much hair from the brushes. When my daughter used it,we did not swifter first and it still did a great job. Cleans all the hair. If you hate to mop or scrub and want a clean floor this is for you.

I packed the battery up along with a copy of the sale receipt and mailed it to the president of the company. They replaced my battery. I used the Scooba twice after that and then it stopped laying down liquid and kept giving me a \\"check tank\\" code. Once again I e-mailed technical assistance at Scooba many times, never received a response. I followed all \\"trouble shooting\\" suggestions in the manuel, nothing worked.

It seems incredible that such an expensive home appliance lasts for such a short time.We also found the Customer Support to be unsatisfactory. The Customer Support seemed to be employees reading from their manuals and were no help at all.

Luckily, I was able to go to Linens and Things and get another one. I hoped I just got a lemon. The next one worked great for the first time too. A couple of weeks later I tried again and it wouldnt work. I charged the battery for over 24 hours (it should only take 16 hours max, per the manual). But when I pressed Power, it wouldnt turn on.

The oldfashioned mop is so much cheaper, easier and quicker to use. I have also had battery problems, which many other people have also had. They have a lot of technical problems they need to work out. If you spend $300 on a product it should work for years, irobot should extend the warranty and stand behind their products.

The unit will not power on. iRobot is replacing it, but I have to pay to ship it to NY....I have about 900-1000 sq feet of large textured tile with 1/4\\" recessed grout lines. Foam collected in grout lines so I reduced cleaning solution to half and that has helped with great tile cleaning results (Scooba is not really cleaning the grout due to it being recessed). I give low marks to the virtual wall -- it has a wide hallo shaped beam so it is not very useful to partition areas. The manual does not give a recommended maximum cleaning area per cycle which is annoying because I know the engineers must have tested for this. I am still experimenting on how to best partition my home to get maximum results per cycle without missing small areas. I did five partitions the first time and it did miss some spots. The unit does not completely dry my tile so I can see exactly where it has been. And yes -- you do have to clean corners by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooba not yet ready for prime time","review":"I have a Roomba, Scooba, and Dirt Dog. These products do a fine job when they work. Except for the new Dirt Dog (so far) they are plagued with battery problems. The quality of batteries in these devices are absolutely the pitts. Do not throw away the box that your little robot came in as you will eventually need it to send it back to the factory. We have replaced batteries, under guarentee, in the Roomba and Scooba. If accidentally uplugged, the battery in the Scooba will be totally dead in one day. Works fine as soon as recharged overnight. The Scooba's tank has to be pried open with a kitchen knife per iRobots suggestion to get it open when it jams. My advice to iRobot is to correct the problems in their present products before coming out with new products. Especially the pathetic batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor battery performance","review":"Battery is completly useless after only a few uses.

But it cleans so well that if you want CLEAN this is the machine! However, I have run into more situations when I need to fix and restart the thing than I'd like. I have not felt that I can turn it on and go out for an errand yet and I've had mine 3 months. Once it went on for an hour and a half and when it stopped I found the dirty tank almost empty and clean tank still full???!!!??? This machine needs maintenance, like a computer to work well, don't expect to just plug it in like a toaster. I still can't get the virtual wall to work but the furniture I move can usually be used as a gate. Overall, if you want clean kitchen floors and don't want to get on your hands and knees, this is so worth it! Good Luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"I've had my Scooba for over a year now, and it has just never worked right. It's been really frustrating, especially since I paid $350 for it. I had such high hopes because I really value my Roomba red, which works well. Frequently the Scooba won't start, and I've done troubleshooting many, many times with iRobot over the phone. On the rare occasion that it does work it leaves a pretty thick layer of water and cleaning solution on my floors, which worries me since they're sealed bamboo. If you have a pet that sheds, like I do, you really have to sweep before using it, or use a Roomba, since the Scooba's vacuum component doesn't seem to work well either. Honestly, I'd recommend Gaiam's far more low-tech version of \\"Swiffer\\" (with re-usable cloth covers and a tank you can put your own cleaner in). The Scooba has just been too much frustration for too much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product and Customer Service AWeful!!!!","review":"When I purchased Scooba, I expected nothing but the same great experience I had with the Roomba products I have used over the course of this year. I have been extremely disappointed with Scooba's incredibly touchy behavior. The tolerance for error when mixing the cleaning product with water to fill Scooba is absolutely horrible. I am successful getting Scooba to actually clean my floors maybe 10% of the time most of the time it just dumps dirty water on my floors. I plan on taking this to the better business bereau because It now just sits in the closet, as I would rather clean my floors on my hands and knees than deal with the frustration of Scooba's error messages over and over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"iRobot Scooba Floor Washing Robotic Hard Surface Cleaner","review":"Love it, love it, love it.

Man, is that water it sucks up off the floor nasty! Sure, it has a problem with corners (it's round, after all), and at least in my experience it needed a little supervision to avoid going under furniture you don't want it to (though the virtual walls generally do a good job), at least you don't have to do most of the work yourself! I found it almost does too good a job of cleaning my vinyl kitchen floor, in that it strips the \\"leading brand\\" (starts with F) no-wax shine treatment off my decades-old vinyl, so I'm limited in using the Scooba for regular cleaning, unless I want to re-apply the shine. Cleaning the Scooba is simple, and it's very thoughtfully designed with the carry handle to load and unload the tank. Now if they just made a shower-cleaning robot..."},{"rating":"2","title":"my issues with it","review":"Well my biggest issue with my Scooba is how loud it is. Its as loud as my regular vac. Other issues I have is you cant leave floor rugs down it gets stuck on them. It gets stuck on the edge of the carpet leading into another room. It left black marks on my carpet. I would use the V wall now that I know. I also think its best for light in between cleanings like the Roomba. Still need to do a real mop job every so often. I also noticed not good at cleaning grout.Now that I gave you the bad here is the good. Its great for busy moms like me who would rather not be moping the floor all the time. As for being loud just use it when you leave the house. I love my i robots. I have the Scooba 3 Roombas and just got the new Dirt Dog for my garage.

However, over the course of two months, it's become troublesome. It no longer vacuums (I have to sweep first) and occasionally pours dirty water onto the floor, to boot. Little things trip it up -- a piece of Easter grass, for example -- and I'm finding the maintenance annoying. In the time it takes to clean out the machine -- removing the brush, et cetera -- I could easily run a Swiffer Wet Jet through the kitchen. This product has great potential, but I wish I had waited a year before purchasing it, giving the manufacturer time to work out the bugs. As I recall Roomba was bug-gy its first year. The manufacturer successfully repaired the bugs and the price dropped to less than half of what it debuted at.

I wanted to try those cheaper ones, so I used them in parallel with the Canadian product to compare. They did not always give similar results. I had an ultrasound done today at the doctor's office and got a shot to make ovulation occur in the next 24 to 36 hours, so I came home and used both products out of curiosity. The Canadian product gave a positive result (it should be!!!) and the Chinese one was negative.Also, be careful, as some sellers use the sentence Early Pregnancy Test to refer to their pregnancy tests, and this is how I was mislead, since Early Pregnancy Tests is also a brand (ovulation kits, pregnancy kits, and other products).

They are a wise and proud people and their land, which you completely escape into through this novel, was and I hope still is worthy of their all-out efforts to live and prosper there. Do not, by the way, expect an intricately plotted novel (the climax, in particular, is 'not all that'). The plot falls into the rhythms of the Arctic seasons, and, as the Union-Tribune writes above, 'Dream' is \\"more a state of consciousness experienced than a tale told.\\" I say experience it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every once in a while you find a great book","review":"This is one of those life changing books, found by accident and passed on to as many friends as I could get to read it. The translation picked up the subtle mood of the story and the \\"lessons\\" were a melody which keeps ringing in my ears. Others have described what happens in the book. I will just say that after I finished the book, there was wonder, clarity, and a peaceful feeling akin to a snowy day sparkling in filtered light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure story in the land of the Northern Lights","review":"This was a hard book to put down once I'd started. The story has a stranded Canadian sailor, John McLennan, as its main character, whose life is saved by the Chukchi. During his becoming adapted to their way of life and marrying among them, he finds the English language useful in communicating with and warding off occasional scientific explorers and other adventurers, who find these inhabitants and their land of Wrangel Island off Siberia tempting prey for get-rich schemers. The full range of lean and prosperous seasons in the stark, isolated landscape circa 1910 to 1917 is heartbreaking and joyous in turns. The reader will find plenty of walrus and nerpa and other sea animals and their usefulness to wonder at. The flavor of the this slice of life comes through too from the translator's leaving in some authentic everyday words, whose meaning is immediately appararent from the context or the aid right at the bottom of the page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good plugs.

It in fact does not. The plug here is meant for the non-turbo'd 2.0 motor not the 2.5 turbo. You can imagine the trouble this could cause.Had to have the car towed to the dealer after the motor began to run poorly, heading to a stall in drive and shutter while in park. Dealer said no long term damage was done but that it could have been much worse.Likely no fault of the NGK plug but Amazon's system for getting it wrong. Either way I am leaving this as a 1 star in hope that people searching will wonder why 1 star and save themselves the expensive troubles I faced. While Amazon covered the cost of getting my car fixed and inspected at the dealer, I see 2-3 weeks later their system still says it works. Dealer made it very clear these plugs were wrong and showed me the difference. It's visible. We spend about 10K/year on Amazon but I will likely not get auto parts again.

The backgrounds given on the players of the time are extremely informative and enlightening.One thing I found interesting was the author talking about Doyle Brunson writing his book, the classic, Super System and how it began to change the poker scene. Similarly with Sklansky. How the once hard learned craft was becoming easily accessible in book form, making players harder to win against. Now 25 years plus later, the vast amounts of literature out there is just mind boggling. It has made the competition that much stiffer, yet I sometimes wonder if it has also put that much more meat in the meat market for the true pros of the game.In closing, I loved the book. A truly amazing read. You get a good feel for how poker was and get a glimpse of how the landscape was beginning to change. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining, though dated","review":"an enjoyable, well-written book that talks a lot about the culture of vegas/poker at the time it was written (early 80s). however, for someone who has already read most of the material available about today/watched high stakes poker/followed current day poker, it will be somewhat review. the sums of money discussed pale compared to their current-day counterparts. has some insightful discussion of gambling/gambling lifestyle in general.all in all, probably the best-written poker book i have read (of 10+)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Poker Read","review":"This book is a must have for the serious poker library. While many of the poker players that Alvarez writes about in the book have now become household names, they were virtual unknowns (outside of their peers) when he wrote this book. This book really was groundbreaking in many ways.Reading this book will enable you to appreciate the mentality of the hi-limit players before poker became mainstream and commercialized. If you want to appreciate a little more about the history of the World Series of Poker, this is a good place to start. The event was not always the \\"circus\\" that it has become today.Alvarez has a nice writing style that is entertaining and easy to read.

If you wonder why you live a life of ups-and-downs, this book can give you some answers. It goes much further than astrology which limits itself within the material universe. It tells about ECK Masters that are still living in their bodies after centuries of their birth. It also tells about the Ancient Science of Prophecy.

The glued-on magnet came off and disappeared, so I glued on another. I dropped it several times and once it partly came apart and the case rubbed the knob. It wouldn't tick. Snapping the case back together (once I figured out what was wrong) fixed it and it's been running two years since. Yesterday, I moved the refrigerator to clean a bad spill and found the magnet. It's back on now. I plan to give some as gifts if I can do that without insulting anyone. If it dies, I'll get another.

A simple idea that could have been effective becomes indulgent with too many talking-head characters in the beginning who don't really have anything to do with the plot. Plus they are poorly played.The two main actors are really good, but they talked and talked and talked. Way too much dialogue, it would have been far more effective cut in half.One close shot of the man's feet walking along toward the beginning of the film really annoyed me because we can clearly see he is walking in place. Why include that shot since it is not really needed and it instantly kills any believability?The decision to make ADAP in black and white also annoyed me because it's like a sign saying \\"this is an important film.\\" But unless there is a legitimate story reason -- like The Artist for instance, because it needed to look like a silent film -- doing so always strikes me as a pretentious decision on the part of film makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented","review":"The product was listed as hardcover.

What is perhaps most satisfying about Clark's work is his innovative use of language -- an energetic prose that spills into the lyrical at every turn. And there are turns that will quite literally 'blow your mind' as you follow the adventurous psyche of a bisexual drug addict whose paranoia is palpable. Psychological science fiction with a distinct taste of Burroughs and Kerouac."},{"rating":"1","title":"an unfortunate trip","review":"This book just proves to me that anyone can publish a book,regardless of talent or capability.

There were more horses in it all and all, and i think that it is well written. The ending makes me desprate for number 16 to come out, a real cliff hanger! Kinda spooky too.

Two scoundrels come into town saying they can make cloth that can't be seen by the dishonest and simpleminded when they really can't do anything of the sort. They trick the emperor into buying a suit of clothes of this imaginary cloth. Emperor wears the suit in a parade and gets heartily embarrassed when it is pointed out that he has nothing on.What makes this story unique is the use of penguins and the wonderful illustrations that are also bold and colorful. I never get tiered of seeing all the neat clothes that the penguins wear, from capes with fringe to billowing skirts, to sailor boy costumes, to clown suits. Also seeing penguins with hair and moustaches is really very cute. This author also wrote another book using the penguin idea. It is called 'Cinderella Penguin or, the Little Glass Flipper'.Loggie-log-log-log"},{"rating":"1","title":"Threading problems","review":"This filter would only partially screw onto my Panasonic camcorder and seat in a slight angle.

To find if the threading problem was related to the camcorder lens or to the filter, I borrowed a Hoya from another camcorder. The Hoya seated perfectly, indicating that the problem was likely due to the defect in the filter threads.The filter came in a clear plastic storage case. The appearance of the packaging suggested possibly long time storage and rough handling.

What was nice about it was that the battery was fully charged when we opened it from the box. We played it ALL day without having to charge it until we went to bed. I gave it 3 stars for educational, it sort of is because you have to think about what your going to do to \\"solve\\" your problems in the game.

First, it is exactly what I thought it wasn't. That is, it is filled with extracts, and sometimes very brief ones. For example, the Infancy Gospels, and the \\"Sybilline Oracles\\". Maybe I am wrong, but it seemed to me you could count on two hands how many complete texts it contained. I do not believe it even contained; \\"Nicodemus\\". Unless it was under an alternate title. Moreover, perhaps some will not agree, but it reminded me, in an offhand way, of a volume of Pre-Socratic philosophy. Or to take that even further, it seemed more a book -about- apocryphal literature; than the literature itself. Is that what it is? Or even a bibliography. Why is everyone calling this the ultimate edition? At nearly $100.00 I will probably return them. If it was half the cost, I might keep them for reference volumes.

Beautifully shot, great Malcolm Mclauren soundtrack, all the supermodels. This video stars the freakishly beautiful supermodel Christy Turlington and takes place when Supermodels ruled the world and lived the lives of rockstars (witness some lady telling Christy, \\"We Love you Christy\\" on the way to a fashion show.Christy takes us behind the scenes to a life of a supermodel during the fashion weeks in Milan, Paris, and NYC. She takes us to 5 star Hotels, Nightclubs, and house parties with other supermodels.Ms. Turlington doesnt show any of the darker sides of the modeling industry, which is the only thing missing from this film. But, this documentary is wonderful journey that show us a side of Christy, Naomi Campbell, and Kate Moss that is rarely seen by the public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"A surprisingly watchable documentary. Christie is the Audrey Hepburn of supermodels, with all the graciousness and class and poise that Hepburn had, and so is a treat to watch move and talk and walk in CATWALK. When you have big-headed, sometimes nasty supermodels like Linda Evangelista and Naomi Campbell annoying the public, it's nice to have a kind Christie Turlington to prove that just because you're beautiful doesn't mean you can't be humble. It's a shame that Christie was diagnosed with emphysema at age 31. She said smoking cigarettes from aged 13 to 26 is probably what brought it on. It's hard to have much sympathy for the rich, famous and beautiful, but my heart does go out to Christie because she seems such a lovely, lovely person in every way, as CATWALK shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see for fashion enthusiasts","review":"For those with a passion for fashion, this movie is well worth the cost.

The book has a nice and non-academic approach to learning XML and using the XML Query language (XQuery) to build application software. The book starts with data concepts and then gives in-depth explanations of the tools, APIs, and libraries available to work with the data. I wish the book covered XML-based application development frameworks and developer tools. Perhaps they steered clear of those topics to make this a book whose content will be valid and useful for years. -Frank"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan Leslie Woodruff's writing is as good as it gets.","review":"Joan Leslie Woodruff deserves to be read. \\"The Shiloh Renewal\\" is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Apparently someone decided that because the protagonist is a teenaged girl, the book must mostly appeal to younger readers. However, this 50+ adult man enjoyed it very much. The story looks at the boundaries between life and death, magic and realism, the past and the present. The focus is on healing, but it's not an easy process. A bonus in this particular modern story is that the reader also learns something about the civil war. As the main character recovers from a brain injury, we gain sensitivity about the plight of such people. Give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrenching.","review":"I read the author's newest, Ghost in the Rainbow, first. It deals with addictions, internal strife, and external failure very well; you begin to feel this woman's suffering. Should be a requirement in any substance abuse program. I was compelled to then read Neighbors. Funny, endearing, and such upbeat characters. Finally I read Shiloh Renewal. I almost didn't because I thought it was a young adult book. Believe me, this is a very mature story. If you ever loved someone and lost them, you've got to read this book. Absolutely wrenching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, fascinating characters, gripping story","review":"The Shiloh Renewal is a powerful and extraordinary story dealing with sorrow and courage and told with wry humor.

Fun to read and surprising.","review":"\\"Shiloh Renewal\\" came as a surprise to me after reading Ms Woodruff's first fiction book \\" Neighbors\\". Her style, certainly on the leading edge of popular literature, tranports us into the deep south and catapults us into a desire to empathize with the period and the characters. We find ourselves crossing over time lines as we are taken into the reality of a young accident victim. The book is abrupt in its closure, but exceedingly memorable in its content and the author probably intended that the reader would be left somehow wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Topic, Good Book","review":"I liked how this book was laid out.

It came out of a gentle wash cycle looking VERY crackled and even peeling off a bit. I was crushed. I wear my crackled shirt around the house, but it's not fit for the public. The dark shirt transfers seem to have gotten much better reviews, but I'm scared to try them because of how horrible this one came out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Product","review":"I have used this product many times.

I cannot say with absolutely certainty that I didn't somehow cause the glasses to break, but I have glasses/goggles which I have had for years and replaced only because the lenses became so scratched up they were no longer useable.

So Id give these 5 stars if the closure on them was a little more toddler proof.

The actor that is supposed to be an American is cast as a stupid, hyperactive moron at every turn. To such a degree that you wish he would die soon.the dubbing is so terrible that at one point you can hear an asian with a southern accent.Thai film use long dialog to state a pont when it comes to thier ghost stories.

It should have never been given the Pulitzer Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning female identity into sheer banality","review":"Despite being the latest darling of the chick lit craze, Barrett's book suffers from a major flaw in characterization. Namely, how was Claire intelligent enough to get through law school despite suffering from such a woefully inept sense of humor and an inability to employ her brain beyond matters of choosing the right lipstick for landing herself a man? More troublesome than the sheer banality of these books is the way sassy one-liners have become a kind of shorthand in women's fiction for independent female identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh a lot....","review":"This is a light, fast paced and breezy chick lit book that I enjoyed reading. I loved that on every page there is something to chuckle and giggle about. The main character, Claire, was really easy to relate to because I think there's so much of her in every women.

The Men's Guide to the Women's Bathroom, the novel, is pretty much your standard chick lit, with the requisite cliches: the love interest, the gay best friend, and the nutty mother.There's nothing here that really distinguishes this book from all the other tripe that's published today.

To this day, I have no idea how far I walked on that hot summer day of 1988 but I kept turning that tape over and over again, thus was my introduction to Pat Metheny.

It is one of the few soundtracks that I've heard that can stand as a complete project on it's own. It's a soundtrack that doesn't necessarily need the movie to carry it. And you can't beat the price.One other thing, Metheny wrote the soundtrack to the Italian movie \\"Passagio per il Paradiso\\" a couple of years ago so \\"Falcon...\\" is no longer his only soundtrack work.

Pat Metheny's style is elemental, somewhat echolaliac, and definitely original. I suppose recalling the starkness of life that had gotten awry from much promise makes one reach back to what made life promising. Thus, from many of those who had reviewed this album, the music might falter in encouraging Pat Metheny would-be fans. I think that for an artist to lend his originality to a film that was stirring (or any film that stirs thoughts towards philosophy-making) Pat Metheny stands out rather well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job","review":"The process was seamless.

At this point I got very angry and took the cd out of the cd player, then snapped it in half and threw it out the car window so that it could be ran over by other cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gem","review":"The Tale of the Tape offers a rare glimpse into the early, post-Piper years of Billy Squier. In my opinion, Squier is a highly underrated, straightforward rocker. His unique vocals perfectly compliment a stripped-down accompaniment of raw guitars and thundering drums. This CD contains a lot of little-known, yet catchy tunes. Not really a bad song on here. Standing out particularly is the anthemic \\"The Big Beat\\" and the girlfriend-gone-astray \\"Who's Your Boyfriend\\". If you like simple, gritty hard rock, then I'd highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good pre-training book","review":"Since I'm going to learn how to paraglide this spring, I decided to buy a book to help initiate me.

He tells you what you can expect your first times launching and landing, the importance of a serious attitude toward this specialized aviation, and all sorts of tidbits about weather and finding lift. Although the book as a whole could have used better organization and proofing before publication, it is nevertheless an enjoyable and informative read."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real detail","review":"Try to cover too much, without much substance.

I took pictures of the Eiffel Tower and was sad to see the Tower upside down and green next to the real thing in my images.

The musicians, songs, and arrangements are great but the stage is cheesy and the sound quality is awful. I have the Africando All Stars CD and the sound is pristine.

And make you a much better texture artist.Then if you add up all of the bonus content available from the website, this DVD is an excellent value.I just wish that what a little more in-depth with UV mapping and some of the other higher-end texturing techniques.and a lack of information on creating atmospherics. Important to remember this is an introduction.Hopefully they'll make advanced lighting and shading DVD of the same quality"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't screw on to lens","review":"The threaded section of the filter is too short.

No more scrubbing on my hands and knees. This gets pretty close to corners and undid 6 months worth of dirt on vinyl floors and now they look like new. For this to be effective I would recommend purchasing a vinyl or linoleum floor stripper and letting that sit for half an hour then use this machine. Follow that up with a floor sealer to make it shine again. I rated it 4 stars because it took half an hour to put together which is not terrible and because the white buffing pads that it comes with are supposed to be attached to the scrubber attachment and it was nearly impossible to do that. I plan on purchasing a separate buffing attachment for my wood floors. I forgot to mention you can also shampoo rugs too I can't wait to try that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious instructions","review":"I haven't even used the machine yet and already I'm unhappy with it. It took me more than 30 minutes to assemble it, working from instructions that were almost indecipherable and pictures tht looked like they were drawn by a second-grader. I found that if you dodn't put the thing together in exactly the right way (which the manual didn't bother telling you about) it would not go together. There were also parts that came with the machine that were not described in the manual. Once I use it, I may be happier, but I can't see why the manual can't be clearer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great machine!","review":"This cleaning machine/polisher is great to remove tough carpet stains and also to buff my laminate kitchen floor.

The accompanying notes give useful information about each artist and his work.The book covers each artist in about 20/25 pages of text and reproductions, except for Norman Rockwell who gets the lion's share with some 48 pages!!! I think this is unfair to the other nine who were not less talented than Rockell, especially Leyendecker, who was the idol of Rockwell who imitated his work!! Nevertheless, the book offers an outstanding spectrum of the work of these masters who were extremely talented and different in style. The book shows that alsmost all of these \\"master illustrators\\" were also very great painters!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great album overlooked...!","review":"This is a great album by Mink Deville. His last release before dropping the name \\"Mink Deville\\" and embarking on a solo career as Willy Deville, which would prove to be a brilliant move, he became a huge draw as an artist in Europe. This 1985 release has some great blues tracks such as \\"Something Beautiful Dying\\", \\"Easy Street\\", \\"Slip Away\\", \\"Italian Shoes\\", and \\"In The Heart Of The City\\". The single that got most of the airplay was \\"I Must Be Dreaming\\", a good song with a great guitar solo. Any of Mink Deville / Willy Deville releases are well worth buying because he truly is an artist in the approach he takes with every song he writes & performs. Music was his life and that alone should tell you how each song he worked on meant to him. Willy Deville passed away in August 2009 and he will be missed by fellow artists and fans of the blues...RIP Willy, your fans will always remember you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid set","review":"This is a good solid no frills set that will do the job.

Great set of weird tales on film","review":"I received the 'The Yellow Sign' last saturday and have watched it a couple of times--SUPERB! The story was changed slightly--but, I feel for the better. Scott emerges as a menacing and creepy character as too does the watchman. I enjoyed the film very much especially the outré and utterly weird music background. Not the least of the films attractions was the fantastic and surrealistic artwork evident in the entire film. The young actress playing Tess had a fresh and teen aged beauty which was very affecting. Very well done! As always these Lurker Films discs are packed with great content and the 8 page booklet was very informative (includes a few words from Lovecraft on Chambers too). Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting adaption...","review":"of the classic weird tale \\"The King In Yellow\\" which, as legend has it, directly inspired HP Lovecraft's oeuvre. I enjoyed many aspects of this adaption, and adaption it is; it takes some license with Robert W. Chambers' original, but it does have enough menace and oddity to make the experience worthwhile. Aaron Vanek's vision of the tale is Lynchian to say the least with peculiar guests populating a deserted hotel and a lot of dark imagery and long shots. Shawna Waldron as Tess is very good, though I feel slightly under-used, and Dale Snowberger as Aubrey is fascinating.Of the additional films on the DVD the standout is Tupilak, a French shortfilm by David Leroy which is superbly shot, acted and scripted. My only complaint is it's too short!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought he'd be taller","review":"Excellent toy, not corny like all the other joke of a batman toy that is out there (ultra parachute laser guided stealth underwater space suit batman).

This excellent film ended with a total unexpected climax that was both eerie and chilling. Outstanding cinamatography and brutal visual splendor lend to this compelling story that ended with a twist that is unexpected."},{"rating":"1","title":"View at your own risk","review":"This is a visually appealing film with a very disturbing ending---the kind that gives bad dreams. Although it is fore-shadowed midway through the film, the details are shocking and not anything you would want in you mind. I cannot recommend this film to anyone. It is definitely \\"thumbs down\\" (and \\"no stars\\") from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cinematography but...","review":"I love films set in polar regions and the cinematography of this piece is stunning. I gave it 2 stars for that reason.There are some beautiful sections of the film, but there's also really creepy violence. If you find it entertaining to see realistic footage of people getting their throats slit, this film is for you. It's not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"no title","review":"Entertaining little volume that does point up the difference between how crime was viewed in 1908 versus today. Smaller crimes of forgery, scams, bank embezzlement, were treated much more harshly than they are now. Of course, their jails were not all filled with drug felons. But the positively most wonderful thing in this book was the very detailed description of the murder of William Marsh Rice, the founder of Rice University in Texas. It didn't open for classes til 1912, four years after this book was written, and twelve years after Rice was murdered by his valet, Jones, under the instigation of a lawyer namend Albert T. Patrick, who forged a will so that he would receive Rice's millions, not Rice University. And in the end Jones, who chloroformed Rice, went free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed Technique","review":"The DVD included with this book gives the most detailed visual instructions on creating bread dough that I have ever seen, much less read. I'm not an avid reader of bread-specific baking books, but the instructions included with the bread recipes in the more general baking books that I own devote about two sentences to how to actually mix the flour with the wet ingredients and develop the dough.This book presents an entire philosophy, and the results have been fantastic. Acceptance of the proper higher initial moisture level and the use of the stretching technique presented here have truly elevated our breads and our interest in breadmaking to a whole new level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every bit as good as the first book","review":"Well I loved this book. The main character's vulnerabilities make her real to me and sometimes I laughed out loud at her mistakes because if I were in her position, I'd do the same exact thing! Her tale is fascinating, full of action and emotion all leading to an ending that left me satisfied, but aching for more all at the same time. I cannot wait for book three!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Such Promise","review":"I had my problems with the first book, but overall I was excited by what I thought would be a great supernatural series, with a snarky non-cookie cutter heroine. Mainly, I thought Ms. Pettersson could have benefited from the use of a good editor. But this new book was a disappointment. The heroine has become Too Depressing To Live. As another reviewer pointed out, absolutely nothing good seems to happen, and while I like my dose of reality, this was way too much. I can't help but think that I would have liked this book more if it was released in winter, but with all this sunshine and blue skies, it was just a complete downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much","review":"The author had one of the best ideas for a paranormal storyline that I have read recently. She really, really came up with a great idea. It's interesting and she has good supporting cast and villains. So, why two stars? The writing of the main character is just pathetic. By the time that I was drug through one too many iterations of her moaning and moping for the \\"love of her life\\" I just couldn't stand it any longer.Now, this may be good stuff for the Romance crowd and if that works for you then enjoy the books. I just can't stand someone who is so strong and defiant about why she can't be controlled by anything continually mope over some guy who she hadn't seen in years and then is suddenly in flames over after a brief visit. Weak minded drivel that belittles the intellect of an otherwise tolerable main character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Really liked the first book. While it wasn't perfect, it had much promise and was a unique story, and I was excited to read the 2nd book. But Book 2 is awful. The story is a mishmash with too many unbelieveable threads. One minute it's imperative she keep her cover secret; the next minute it's no longer an important part of the story. The main character makes idiotic choices, not just once but again and again. I read the whole book, hoping it would redeem itself at the end. Unfortunately, it did not. I won't be reading a book 3 if there is one. Very disappointing. I gave it 2 stars because while the character really was too dumb to live, the book itself was fairly well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing read.","review":"From page one of the first book I was hooked, and I am not disappointed in the least by the second in the series. The author has a wonderful writing style, the city and the characters come to life. The fantasy elements are not only well done, but are actually believable. I would cheerfully recommend this book to anyone I know. The characters are interesting, deep and lovable, or love to hate in the case of the bad guys. I can't wait to read the third book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately not packaged for shipping","review":"I read the reviews and knew the risk going in.

The person that wrote this script picked up every stereotype and myth about Viet Nam and Viet Nam veterans and wove it into the story.I guess you have to keep in mind that even when this industry tries to do factual stories they resort to the phrase 'based on' to excuse their careless handling of facts - in this case they have a 'based-on' 'based-on' movie.I'm amazed that any actor, actress, or director could have read this script and agreed to perform such trash.The idea that the woods are full of poor, crazed Viet Nam veterans - suffering from the trauma of killing children in Viet Nam is just silly.It's a fact (check the 2000 census) that while 10% of the population live below the poverty line - only 5% of veterans do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Gospel?","review":"Is this the actual Gospel?

I delayed getting this book, because the review below me mentioned that portions were out of date. It is not completely true, however. Yes, there are some sections where the Rules are misnumbered (due to the 2003 amendments), but the author corrects it by telling you what the new Rule number is. I was very careful when reading this chapter because of the warning of the other reviewer, but I have yet to find anything incorrect with the information.

The depth and talent that this quintet possesses is definitely present and inspiring. But, keep in mind, it is still a debut album. Places are a tad choppy. Example, Paradise starts off great, but the solo near the end is a little over the top, something which even Nick Hexum has even agreed with. This is a definite must-have for any 311 fan. This is a must have for any musician. This is a must have for any appreciator of good music. Basically, you shoud buy this album.Side note: This album contains one of the greatest songs of all time.

And as you will hear, from the start \\"311\\" had great and positive lyrics, delivered perfectly from S.A. and Nick Hexum. I also feel, this is the point that \\"311\\" became the new \\"Chili Peppers\\", for me anyway. They just had that energy. This album is also actually 12 tracks, the last one being one of the best.

Vornan-19) is one of my favorite Silverberg novels, one of a string of brilliant works he wrote in the late 60s / early 70s.In 1999, on the eve of the millenium, a stranger named Vornan appears mysteriously on Earth, claiming to be a visitor from the future. The government, looking for anything to distract attention from the riots of the Apocalypse cults, welcomes Vornan and sends him on a worldwide tour of Earth in the company of several prominent scientists, each of whom is either trying to debunk him or pump him for information on the future.Short (about 200 pages), engaging, with cleanly drawn and compelling characters, this is Silverberg at his best, and should be a model for aspiring writers of any genre - tell the story well and be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My dog went through a bout of demodex mites due to a low immune system. He lost a lot of hair due to this. This product is what my vet recommended I give him to get him back on track after the mites were gone. A lot of people told me it would take a long time for him to get his hair back, especially on his legs, but it grew back really quick and I contribute it to this product. If you decide to use this, it's a lot cheaper getting it by the gallon on your own rather than going through a vet. Though it is still a bit pricey, a pint cost me $25 at the vet's, so getting it on Amazon was a lot better. I really think this has made a difference in my dog. You can put it in his food, or let him lick it from a dish like a treat. He enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Optima 365 Dog","review":"I've used this product for a few months now and I've seen a difference in the shedding.

My dog does not have Urinary Track problems so I sure can't use the product they sent. There as no phone number to contact the seller and apparently the process in place does not work.

It wears out within two weeks, then the buttons are inoperable and useless. The true problem with this Naki controller lies in the joystick. Since it is the most durable (not saying much) part of the controller, it lasts about about a day longer than the other parts. The stick then becomes very unsensitive in one direction. The Z button underneath the controller caves in very quickly with handling.

This is perhaps the dullest \\"history\\" that I have ever read.

Much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unessential Reading","review":"For a \\"historian\\", the author has exceedingly narrow, parochial tastes.

Surely there must be SOME compelling reason to buy this book. Why does the author have to drag us through pages and pages of uninteresting minutiae?

What insights it provided were hardly worth making. Better to subscribe to the magazine, which is not, as the author maintains, on the creative downside. Deford, Jenkins, et al. were no prose giants. In retrospect, they were lucky to have access to a vehicle that would print their second-rate blather. I much prefer today's writers. They're funnier, write more crisply and take sportswriting for what it is - entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big loser of an SI history that's as dull as ballpark dirt","review":"McCambridge waxes nostalgic about a Sports Illustrated that never was. Did he really go back and look at old issues? His hero, Dan Jenkins, was only semi-readable. The writers today are superior on every count.

It was wonderful there and is wonderful to have at home as well. The animation is great, and I believe I heard that they animated every hair on Merida's beautiful red-haired head.The characters are fun, the story line inspiring and eye-opening and the graphics and animation are top notch.A beautiful movie with humor, lessons, and fun for both boys and girls, moms and dads."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching and Heartwarming Tale","review":"I don't know that I can say anything more than what so many others have already said about this movie except, it made me cry. It's a touching and heartwarming tale about a tomboy Scottish princess who refuses to become the lady her mother, the queen, requires her to be. In an attempt to change her mother, with the aid of a woodcarving witch, her mother is changed into a bear. The rest of the movie is a journey of discovery as mother and daughter grow closer, trying to undo the spell before it's made permanent. It's funny, it's moving, overall its a good time. Kids will enjoy it, parents will love it. The animation is top notch, the music is wonderful and compliments the story beyond words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This movie is a must see. it has great characters with a great story line.

(I've seen it twice)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasty but deadly poison for tweens","review":"Despite the quality animation, I could not identify with the decision of the main character to put her strict but caring mother in danger merely to satisfy her selfish ends. We were reminded of a standard Disney theme: headstrong young female defies parental authority and although her life is threatened and many other lives are put at risk, ultimately everyone has 'learned' from this selfish person and she is gloriously rewarded for her defiance.Yes she was unaware of the risks she was taking, but that's the definition of selfishness - not taking any time to consider the consequences your actions might have on others.\`Tasty but deadly poison for 8-14 year old girls IMHO. My children will not be watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pixar is in trouble!","review":"I don't mind strong female characters but I don't need the fact that they are strong female characters to be constantly shoved in my face because I'm intelligent enough to figure that out for myself!

Maybe it's because this is Pixar and not Disney outright, but I didn't think that would make a difference. The music isn't as good, and the second half of the movie dragged quite a bit. I thought the story line was a bit outlandish, even for a fairy tale, and somewhat confusing. I'd recommend renting this one first to make sure you like it - wish I had done so & saved the $20.P.S. My daughter is 2 1/2, and she was fine with the \\"scary\\" scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed, bizzarre and hard to follow","review":"Usually I enjoy Disney/Pixar works. That being said, this has got to be the poorest attempt at a decent story line I've seen in a while. The characters are enjoyable and the overblown cultural stereotypes will bring out laughs. After the movie is over, however, you'll probably be left wondering exactly what you just experienced. The moral component of this story is humility over pride and love over control. Some of the ideas were really good and the graphics were incredible, but the story is so disjointed and incomplete that it brings the movie down - way down. Some of the bear scenes as well as the witch scene will probably be a little too much for younger kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed So Hard","review":"I laughed so hard in parts of this I was crying.

That said, a weak film from Pixar is still a higher quality than most films. The setting of the film was wonderful, a good backdrop for the friction between selfish Merida and Her proper mother. A simple story, beautifully told, can be very powerful. And indeed , it is, even if we never quite see Merida's strength. We can see her bravery, because bravery is not always about adventurousness, but sing the courage to admit you are wrong and to try and change to become a better person. That is real courage, because it can be more difficult that courage in the face of physical danger."},{"rating":"1","title":"US region","review":"The DVD is US region, this was not put in the description.

That said, I loved that she was her own person and she made the right decisions to get out of a bind. This is what I want my daughter to do, be her own person, making her own decision and then finding the perfect prince charming, because he will be an awesome guy that respects her. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!","review":"Another wonderful princess movie by Disney.i wish the father was more involved since this family is actually all still together.

That alone should be a sign of its quality. A close second to tangled, brave is enriching, funny, powerful, sweet, action-packed, intense, and beautifully animated with wonderful music and excellent voices.

I have three young boys and they got kind of bored with brave. On the other hand they loved Madagascar 3. Basically its a story of a free spirited and rebellious skinny teenage girl with a massive hairdo who doesn't want her parents to force her into marriage. Her passion is riding her enormous clydesdale horse (Angus) and shooting arrows at stuff... similar to hunger games in that regard, also found it similar to disney's tangled.

This is an awesome edition!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scottish brogue... best accent ever!","review":"There's plenty of brogue as the heroine struggles to come to grips with how to be a prim and proper Princess when all she wants to be is a warrior with outstanding bow skills. It is true to how a teen must break away from their parents' and sometimes society's expectations to discover themselves. It also shows how you can rebel and still meet everyone's expectations, even your own by being true to yourself. There is family conflict, teen-age angst, personal growth, loss, love and reunion. It's a Disney classic... and I love those! Sit back and enjoy a great story, a great moral and lots of flying orange hair!

The heroine protagonist is charming, but unfortunately nothing interesting happens to her. The film feels over before it even began, and the themes are so provincial its hard to really get involved on the scale of a film. Its almost feels more like an extended medieval Scottish sitcom.Without spoiling anything, the flame haired lead, Merida has to break an unwanted spell. The way the spell is broken turns out to be so simplistic and lacking in obstacles, that the movie has to invent a bunch of very weak contrivances to pad out the film's finale. The only audience for this film is very young children, if that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave","review":"I love Brave! The movie was cute, funny, scary in some parts and it teaches you a lesson.

Instead it's a very unique and sweet story about a mother and daughter. The detail and graphics were excellent and the cast really drew me into the story. I really enjoyed watching this over and over again with my four year old niece who like to act like the little bear brothers, while I personally and secretly wish that I had Merida's archery skill, (and her beautiful Shire horse.:)) Definitely full of giggles, thrills, suspense and even a touching tear jerker moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family movie.","review":"This is a great movie.

I purchased this movie with the intent of watching it on my TV via Apple TV and because I couldn't download a specific file I was unable to put into my apple library with all my other movies. Similar to what I would do if I downloaded a CD. This is unacceptable and therefore I bought the same exact movie from Itunes so I don't have to log into some stupid app that I can download but only watch the movie on my ipad or iphone.

In my opinion, they've always delivered great films. This movie, however, was truly disappointing. The trailer made it out to be more of an adventure film but instead we got a cheesy and unoriginal animated feature. This may be because they replaced directors mid-film. We'll never know what was originally intended for Brave and while it may be a shame, there's no use trying to find a masterpiece where this is none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave lacks substance, originality","review":"The start of the film may seem like something promising, maybe like a 'How to Train your Dragon' theme. However, the movie quickly turns into a road that has been all too well-traveled. How many movies can you name where the main character doesn't like the situation they are in, turns to witches and magic, doesn't get what they bargain for and the rest of the movie is based on fixing that problem?Answer: too manyObviously, that's where I think the movie lacks originality. Tired of the same ol' thing from Disney. Hoping whoever is left from the original Pixar crew will stand up to what's helped them become such a success story and go back to those unique and fresh elements.Just an honest opinion, but another movie with this same plot and Pixar will RIP in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"violent and disappointing","review":"The violence between heroine Merida's parents (father trying to kill mother) is deeply disturbing. The heroine is a skilled archer who saves the day by sewing. Her desire to be treated as a person rather than an object is \\"selfish\\". Wanted to like this movie but couldn't...not a story I want my daughter to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Getting Old","review":"This \\"You can do any thing\\" women empowerment thing is getting old. How about setting a more realistic fantasy. I have seen women of this programming closed fist strike a guy 200 lbs heavier than them, not fat, and not understand why the open hand strike they received back was so powerful. Never would I encourage the striking of a woman, but movies like this are the reasons scenarios like that happen. every human being is limited, women, far beyond most men in multi-tasking, are not physically built like men. Other than having a cliche plot, with a bunch of bumbling cowardly men, and a downgraded demonized stay at home mom, this movie really failed to impress me with Pixars real capabilities, like what we see in Finding Nemo and How to Train a Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE DON'T LET YOUR CHILDREN WATCH","review":"this movie was so upsetting!

Kind of like Brother Bear, except with a mother-daughter relationship instead of a pair of brothers.The characters in this movie, were, to me, pretty unlovable. Merida herself I found to be very immature at times. I know this is a coming of age story, but she seemed to just be extraordinarly whiny at times. I did enjoy her brother's antics, they were probably the high point of the movie for me.The music was good, though not very memorable.The animation was beautiful!Overall it was a good movie, it just doesn't compare to Toy Story and Up as far as leaving an impression and being really remarkable goes. And as the first Pixar movie aimed at a female audience, I'd had really high hopes for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Practically Unwatchable","review":"This movie was dull, trite and silly (not the good kind of silly).

The 3D Animation is probably one of the best that Pixar has released. The voice actors were good as well.The only problem is that Pixar has risen the bar so high for themselves that this movie does not compare to some of the greats story-wise. It lacked a little in the general overall story and character development that existed in most of the other movies.That being said, it was still a great movie, worthy of being added to any family's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"Great movie for a family with a wonderful message!

From the setting to the costumes to the music to the quaint Scottish dialect, Brave is a masterful and mesmerizing tale of love told so beautifully in a message of timeless depth and power. From the opening scene, the viewer is swept away by the bold colors, the sympathetic characters, and the visual imagery that move across the screen and straight into your heart.

Pixar seems to be losing their storytelling mojo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"Besides the usual glitzy animation from Pixar, there's not much in this movie. There was clearly a lot of investment in getting the physics of curly hair believable, so kudos to the technical wizardry, but the story was a total disappointment. Everything happens more or less between two principle locations (castle and the \\"stonehenge\\"), visited repeatedly by the main characters, although the canvas for this story could have been much bigger. Humor appears in the wrong places and several scenes are stretched too long (e.g., the bear chase in the castle). The actions of the princess, such as giving her mother an unknown spell from a demented witch, are simply too ridiculous to believe (unless her bravery is compensated by a low intelligence)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"An awesome princess tale that isn't centered around some \\"romance\\". Creative and fun . Merida is so much more human than other characters I've seen. She is proud,strong and selfish. You watch her develope into a kind and noble person. You also see that sometimes the \\"greater good\\" starts at home with her mother the Queen. The real adventure is not all the incredible things that happen, but rather how everyone grows from it. Plus a ferocious fight scene at the end doesn't hurt either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I found this movie to be extremely disappointing in content (however, the graphics were beautiful). I will not be showing it to my 8 year old daughter. The main character, Merida, gives her mother a magical cake without even knowing what it will do to her. That is completely irresponsible and disrespectful, and not the kind of message I want to give to my children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie bad streaming service.","review":"This movie was good and I and the grand kids enjoyed watching it.

Secret of the wings (she watched it 6 times) and she didnt even asked to watch this movie second time...that shows how miserably disney failed in presenting this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best animated movies of 2012","review":"Brave is one of those family movies you want to watch over and over again, good humor, excellent animation, good story.

Big hair. But I thought they did hair pretty well in Monsters Inc. And if you're really worried about getting good hair, don't pick a huge mass of red curls (that's going to look animated just because it's outrageously red), pick slightly curled brown hair that reacts the the moisture in the air by frizzing halfway through the day.Not much storywise, not a compelling plot, very predictable.

One of the best new Disney films!"},{"rating":"1","title":"most disappointing pixar movie","review":"this movie seemed more like a disney movie than what i expect from a pixar movie. even by disney movie standards, it was poor. the story was very weak. I kept waiting for the movie to get to some sort of adventure or point and by then it was already over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting more","review":"Movie was really not worth watching that is my opinion, what a waste. 10 seconds of genuine emotion when mom was expected to turn back into human that's it, she was even bossy toward mom when she was a bear. Animation was good but I think plot was dreadful. They should have had the spell do something to the bratty girl instead of mom changing to bear. but we are entitled to our opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visuals: Stunning, Plot: Tired, Funny: Not","review":"The title pretty much says it tall. Characters are all exceptionally cliched archetypes, paper-thin and 100% predictable. Not a single laugh-out-loud moment. Overall, a very formulaic effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story line was ok, but","review":"The story was quite interesting and was very entertaining up to the point of the result of visiting the old crone in the forest. Story went pretty much downhill from there. Animation was definately very well done, but they need a new screenwriter.

I give the Amazon streaming service, with the recurring stalls and re-starts, a 1.5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"I've seen every Pixar film but Cars 2 and this was easily Pixar's weakest effort. It's story we've all heard too many times to put any original spin on it but even Pixar's typical twist where the story is told through toys, cars, wildlife, robots, etc was missing. It will be the only Pixar film that doesn't end up in my house on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid Pixar film","review":"Animation is awesome, plot pretty decent, 'acting' pretty decent, comic relief is very entertaining.

I mean I loved Tangled, The Incredibles, The Little Mermaid, etc. What does getting a witch to turn your mother into a bear have to do with archery and being BRAVE? So stupid. My husband and I would like the 1 1/2 hrs returned to us. Ugh.

I especially liked the humor, and the little brothers were very cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the whole family","review":"It's always refreshing to see a strong female character. My 3 year old son loves this movie (even though parts a bit scary to him) and I appreciate him seeing a strong female character. Watching it is a wonderful excuse to snuggle up with the family, but it's not my favorite movie- strange storyline- loud rambunctious scenes which seem to go on forever. But it is beautiful to watch (especially the bears gathering salmon out of the river- wow!). It's definitely worth a watch, but not my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently made, entertaining with a moral to the story. The plot isn't original, but it's good.","review":"I love this movie. Fantasy, happy endings, comedy, and a lesson. Good for young girls just exhibiting rebellion. I'm 55 years old, but the kid in me is alive and well. I tend to be nonobjective when it comes to Disney and Pixar animations. I don't think I have seen two or three I didn't like. It brings back the wonder and excitement of a full, wonderful life ahead, where it's possible to achieve most anything, and be the master of your fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie would recommend","review":"I would definitely recommend seeing this movie...loved it and its a great family movie and teaches a good lessons to young kids.."},{"rating":"2","title":"brave","review":"brave- movie was well done and carried a message for all adults and children- good photography and realistic message -helpful for young adults also"},{"rating":"2","title":"fm for the whole family","review":"Great movie for the whole family.

It was an early Christmas present, and she has already seen it several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story great, 3D worth it.","review":"This was a classic story about a rebelious princess and how she comes to realize that being stubborn will hurt the ones around you that you love. It has amazing animation, great scenery, and memorable characters. It also came in 3D which in this movie, did not seem to pop out that much at first, but after watching it in 2d, I definately appreciated how much depth the 3D gave the setting and scenery. Definately worth the buy because you will watch it again, especially if you have kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story, film, and even DVD cover","review":"I took my daughter to see this for her birthday. What a great memory for the first time watching this lovely movie! I adore Merida and all that she stands for. The music and cinematography are gorgeous. Seeing a strong female character is quite important to me as a mother.

There was poor plotting, characterization and not much action.How to train your dragon was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo for unnecessary format discs","review":"Why do studios insist that, in order to get some movies (especially kids' movies) on Blu-Ray, we must also purchase a DVD, Digital disc copy, and now a 3D Blu-ray? I don't need any of those extra discs, can't even USE one of them. I just want to get the movie in BD format, plain and simple. I don't mind the 5-disc Ultimate Edition's existence, I would just rather that it be a Special Edition, for die-hard collectors only.As DVD is slowly getting phased out of the market, let's shift the reach of the single-disc option from the lower-quality DVD to the now-standard Blu-Ray format.EDIT/Correction: There IS a 3-disc edition which contains only the Blu-Ray and DVD edition of the movie, for those of us who don't want/need the BD 3D or Digital formats. It simply doesn't show up here at Amazon when browsing the DVD or 5-Disc BD editions for some reason. The edition is here, for those looking for this edition:Brave (Three-Disc Collector's Edition: Blu-ray / DVD)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Barbie","review":"Garbage. The worst from the wonderful folks at Pixar. Sadly, in this one we have a know-it-all adolescent showing everyone about wisdom, and showing it with the attitude of a Barbie heroine. And the story! What story? For example, whatever happened to Merida's attitude (make that Attitude) about not being able to choose her own husband? Got me.A world away from the beauty and magic of Wall-E, La Luna, the Toy Stories. Here, we're told we should all bring up our babies to be Hillary Clintons. Fans of \\"Brave\\" should immediately turn to HBO's current skank show \\"Girlzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.\\"Appropriately dedicated to Steve Jobs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave, what you must be to watch this again","review":"Pixar proves the dreadful WALLE was no fluke and saddles movie-hungry kids and parents with this sad, heavy handed European fable. In the theatre, I wanted those 2 hours back. I can't imagine watching this at home. Too scary for the little ones, Brave is another magic-driven plotless morality tale beating you relentlessly over the head, which I have learned to expect from Disney. The heroic Merida deserves better than being cast in this horrible movie that firmly proves that Pixar has lost its way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The computer graphics are just amazing. I love the story too. Another hit for the team! I even bought a copy for my niece!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film for kids & adults","review":"This is an entertaining animated film that is both dramatic and funny for both children and adults. Both my daughter and I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Pixar Movie, and a great deal for this item.","review":"Great deal here. For 20.00, I got a Blu-Ray, DVD and a bonus movie. Great movie too. I purchased it sight-unseen because I love Pixar's work but also it's just great reference (I'm a 3D artist too). The hair and water sims in this movie are mind-boggling. Great story too, of course. I totally recognized Kelly MacDonald's voice from Boardwalk Empire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and touching","review":"Beautiful colours. Nice movie. Really enjoyed it. Nice way to pass a Friday night for those who don't hang out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Brave!","review":"This movie is very well done in every way I can think of.

Instead of the past Pixar quality story-line, this movie ended up being just another Disney \\"princess\\" movie that Pixar happened to animate. It seems Pixar has become nothing more than an outlet for Disney merchanidising potential. Bring back the heart of Up, charm of Wall-e, fun of Toy Story, and warmth of so many of the others! Here's hoping that Pixar gets back to what they used to do best...create a GREAT story we haven't seen over and over, then add their past wonderful animation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"I thought this movie was pretty bad, and I signed on to Amazon to tell people this because the trailer you see for this movie is completely misleading. (Spoiler alert): It is not about a young girl who is courageous and fights for something realistic or anything like that, its simply about a girl who follows magic lights in the forest to a witches house and subsequently has her mother turned into a bear, and she spends the rest of the movie trying to turn her back into a human. I am a big fan of pixar films, but this one, this one is just stupid. And let me note, I expected a lot from this movie too, so that may play in to my 1 star review, the trailer looked really good, but its nothing like what the trailer portrays."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was just okay","review":"The reason I gave it 2 instead of 3 stars is because neither I or my 3 year old liked it very much. Not one that I will purchase. Watched Madagascar 3 a week earlier and it was by far the more entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was a bit disappointed in Pixar to have added crude parts to the film, things that they have not done before, and I was disappointed that they would fall into those, which many other films in different studios have done. I have loved Pixar for not adding those things in the past. This is not something I will let my small children watch. There were some scary parts that would be a little much for little viewers. I loved the story, loved the graphics. Amazed by the Animation- Pixar knows how to do it! But wish they would have kept it to the standard they have upheld in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for kids, predictable and boring for adults","review":"When it comes to animated movies, I prefer those that connect with audiences at multiple levels.

Story wise, it was the deepest let down imaginable! The \\"funny\\" parts weren't funny at all and involved the people being naked from the waist down ( shown from the back )...

She is independent minded and wants to pursue her own destiny. She receives an unfortunate spell from a witch and must try to undo it. This is another solid effort in the animated category that combines a compelling storyline with excellent computer animation.

Her beautiful flowing red locks are quite the site to see, and add an element of visual flair to the film.

Well, what a disappointment! The message re mother-daughter relatins got completely obscured by the ludicrous fighting scenes (apparently they were supposed to be funny?).

Better on a second viewing. Pixar as always delivers the anticipated phenomenal animation. The score was complimentary to the action and the story while \\"simple\\" was sufficiently embellished to keep interest throughout. Suitable for kiddies and adults. A good addition to any family film library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promotes pride in children","review":"This movie does not herald virtue. It promotes vice. In one moment, it says that pride is the problem that causes all the turmoil in her family. Then, it says that \\"I must choose MY own fate\\", thus promoting pride! The only person who changes is the mom, but not the child. Long-standing family and cultural traditions, as well as the wisdom of elders is mocked in this movie, in exchange for doing \\"what I want\\" and \\"following my heart\\". Where's the chivalry in that?Moms, if you want your daughters to learn how to talk back to you and become more selfish, have them watch this movie.Dads, if you want your children to see you as nothing more than a buffoon with no real authority, have them watch this movie.I'm disappointed with Pixar. They had set a standard for classy movies, but this felt more like Shrek to me. Want your kids to see images of bare backsides and cleavage? It's all in this \\"family\\" movie. Tasteless humor, and promoting selfishness with no lasting consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter waste","review":"How this won an oscar over wreck it ralph is beyond me.

My three year old son's favorite movies are Cars, Incredibles, Toy Story, Monsters Inc, and Finding Nemo. I was really excited to bring him to Brave as a fun activity together. We went to see it in the theater with his best friends who are 5 and 4 years old (and their mom). Boy did we regret it! It was scary for all them. At one point all three boys were crying and frightened. The story line was not interesting to them (or to us). The movie lacked the humor that pixar generally brings.

The animation was pretty nice and the visuals were probably pretty amazing in the theater. It's just that the story was kind of dumb. I like the idea of a girl who wants to change her destiny from one of being married off to one in which she has a say and think it's empowering for young girls. However, her mom gets turned into a bear? We were sitting there going, who came up with this idea?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Great movie!

On Amazon prime it was a two day rental. the kids watched it twice. If you're Irish or Scottish you'll get a big kick out of the movie. it's like the cartoon version of Braveheart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adults liked it more than the kids","review":"We watched this on Thanksgiving with family from 1 to 85 years of age. It did not hold the interest of the small kids and they were scared by the bears fighting. The 20-30 age group and older adults enjoyed it more. The movie was beautifully filmed in very vibrant colors. I liked the little red haired girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie","review":"Nice plot for a Mother/Daughter resolution play. It would have been better if there had been at least one or two admirable male characters. Perhaps if the father figure hadn't been so dumbed down. As it is, this movie doesn't have a single significant adult male character which isn't the cartoon representations of some form of stupid, evil, or awkward. Only the mother and daughter come close to being normal in both their cartoon physical form and character representation. Maybe this is a good movie for a single Mom to share with her daughter?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for femenist moms but.........","review":"This is a movie about bashing little boys. Some producers have decided to deviate from the traditional girl finds prince scenario. That scenario, is really what makes a great film. What they did in Brave, is attack and undermine little boys. If you are an adult and can see through the political correctness amuck then watch it. Please do not let impressionable children see it. It will give the message that boys are inferior goofs.There is nothing wrong with a young girl dreaming of finding her perfect soul mate (prince) in life.Unfortunately, a few bitter and angry woman want to take this away.I saw the film at a friens home. I would personally not contribute finacially to this cause. Send a message by not buying films like this"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, defective dvd.","review":"My kids and I immensely enjoyed the movie.

However, the picture quality of the purchased DVD is not that good. It is very red and dark. We have so many other movies on DVD that are fine. Perhaps our DVD player needs to go, but I was surprised at the picture quality for this movie.

Couldn't stop laughing on some parts. A must have for all Disney lovers out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story line","review":"Brave takes CG animation to a new level and is a visual feast, however, the story line is weak and the movie loses steam and focus just when it should crescendo. The title is a misnomer. The heroine isn't as brave as she is a self-centered narcissist, but that will appeal to the teenage and 20 something set for whom this mindset is normative. But perhaps mother-daughter conflicts are just not as appealing to me as other plot devices. I was expecting something along the lines of \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\", but it falls way short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technology duth not make a geat movie alone","review":"Our 3 year only (in to Disney Princess industry in a big way) lost interest in this story after 10 minutes. To be honest so did I. The plot was a little hard to grasp for tots and unfortunately the state of the art graphics and animation did not make up for the less than perfect script and story. Not worth the price of the rental for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Pixar, Why?!!","review":"One extra star for Best Rendering of Hair in a Computer Animated Feature.

It's just okay. Honestly, if I had seen it before purchasing it would not have even gotten it at all. Not even at the price we got it for. I will probably never watch it again. My kids didn't even seem interested, either. We'll see if they want to watch it in the future. My recommendation is try before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave","review":"Very good and pretty movie. The picture quality is amazing everything is so clear and bright.

We got a good price also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pixar Movie","review":"I knew next to nothing about the plot of this film besides it being about a headstrong girl that with a mop of red hair. I was pleasantly surprised by the touching story. While I found myself identifying with the girl, my wife felt the girl was more to blame instead of the mom like I concluded. Regardless, the movie was funny, charming, very colorful and vibrant and nicely animated. I would have given it 5 stars but my wife insisted on 4 because the two songs that were sung, the artists had no accent while singing and she felt it did not match the thick accents of the cast very well. Overall, as an adult, I felt this was a very good movie that was fun and entertaining that also had a point to make while not being heavy handed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy to have my own","review":"I really wanted to watch this movie over Christmas but every copy I rented stopped and got stuck in the exact same area in the movie, which was soon after the beginning.

Not sure why this happens so we just hooked up Bose speakers and still enjoyed the movie. I'm sure someone out there knows the solution to this problem..? Quality of picture was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess Disney needed another product line so out comes this story.","review":"Same old same old story. Lacking all novelty. Lame parents.

I usually love these movies but they missed the mark on this one. I loved the idea but was let down"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"There was not a particular aspect of the movie that was particularly disappointing. It was just weak all around. The animation was good, but the storyline and character development was shallow and predictable. It was like watching a high quality Saturday morning cartoon episode. Plus the message for children was not exactly exemplary: while your defiant spirit gets you in trouble, it can also get you out of it. Hmmm... dunno about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice move, if I could have finished it","review":"It crapped out halfway through watching it and I was never able to get it to play again on my Kindle Fire, my desktop, or my Roku.

She was an awesome character, and Kelly MacDonald was a perfect choice (even if I kept picturing her role in Boardwalk Empire)...the rest of the cast was great.I had a lot of fun watching this with my toddler (when she actually paid attention). It's not violent; I was surprised they were able to make this type of movie without any gratuitious violent, but it had much less fighting than a movie such as Hercules.Overall a pleasant watch and probably a good addition to the collection, but the thirtysomething man in me was just hoping for a little more adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good childrens movie","review":"There is some moral in the story.

My kids are 6 and this movie showed them how to mend what pride has broken. Awesome movie my number 1 disney movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bears?!?!? Stinking previews!","review":"For me this movie was a prime example of misleading previews!! I went into this movie thinking I was going to see the story of a princess who fights to keep her freedom...and to be honest I kind of got that for the first 20 minutes of the movie. She quickly looses the battle has a tantrum and runs away, gets a potion from a witch and turns her mom and 3 siblings into bears. Then realizes that maybe she shouldn't have done that and tries to get an antidote before her father kills said bears. I found the story to be very boring and in general badly written. I didn't care about any of the characters, which surprises me so much as this came from Pixar and they ALWAYS get me to care about the characters. The animation was stunning that's why it gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, but 3-D effects are not worth it.. Save your money and buy the blu-ray","review":"There are over 800 reviews of this movie as I write this, so obviously this has been reviewed many times before.Because it already has so many reviews, this is not a review of the movie itself, but specifically of the 3-D portion. Some 3-D movies are really incredible, with objects \\"flying\\" out at you and things \\"floating\\" in your living room. These 3-D movies, in my opinion, are absolutely worth the extra money. Others, however, simply give the movie another layer of depth, but are not really that different from the blu-ray version. This is the case for Brave. Great movie, but I was very disappointed with the 3-D effects. Save yourself the extra money and buy the blu-ray version instead. If you want a great Disney movie with fantastic 3-D effects, buy Tangled instead. The 3-D effects are unbelievable!(I gave it 4 stars because it is a very good movie, but minus one because of the 3-D effects.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave","review":"Awesome deal! Great movie for children, I bought this gir Christmas gift and I know my daughter will be super excited!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Streaming Quality Poor","review":"The movie itself was not too bad if you like Disney movies. Nothing spectacular about this one. I streamed this from Amazon and the quality of the picture was poor. Many scenes had poorly defined pixels. My high speed internet connection was working fine. So I can only conclude the problem was on the Amazon end of things. Perhaps their streaming services were too busy at the time or maybe there is a problem with their stored video content for this particular movie. I watched Ice Age 2 (a better movie by the way) the next day during the same time frame and the quality of the picture was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different and Visually appealing","review":"* Lot of great scenes in the animation* Characters are a treat, very creative, will have kids think and imagine lot of things* Takes kids to a different world, though I disagree with an earlier comment regarding the independent part. Kids have to understand parents do things for a certain reason, if all kids become independent at young age, then why parents or teachers? May give a wrong message to the already confused kids of our generation.* Songs are nice, soundtracks very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great role model","review":"It was great to see a strong female character who wasn't love struck.

Since I raised both of my daughters to be strong, independent young ladies, I saw our relationships unfold throughout this Disney animated story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"It may not measure up to other Pixar movies , but it's still an amazing movie. I can see why some people may not like it because it's similar to another Disney movie (Brother Bear). However, I think the movie was cute and the animation was stunning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"It is an amazing movie, a great quality and a modern notion of the disney princess, more contemporary and a down to earth character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bravery","review":"This offering is intended for an audience to run through in a light hearted manner, but it bored me silly. I was lost in the silly girl in quest of changing her mother's mind to the wild extreme of making a deal with a witch and turning her mother into a bear, sorry it just did not resonate for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This movie was not nearly as good as the hype. I felt like it was very short and cheesy and lacked the adult disney humor in their older movies -- that let adults enjoy them as much as the kids do!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rare Pixar misstep. And what a shame!","review":"What a missed opportunity - Pixar could have done so much better. It's like they went for the lowest common denominator. Think of great movies like \\"How to Train Your Dragon\\" and \\"The Incredibles\\" --- innovative films that don't rely on rehashed ideas from other cliche-ridden movies. Anything old, these movies reinvent and make new again. That is what Brave should have been. Instead we have a movie that should have been called \\"Brother Bear 3.\\"Yes, my kid enjoyed the movie and that is what counts. But the truly great Pixar films have not been directed simply at kids; they are family films that can be enjoyable for anyone at any age. I can watch \\"Finding Nemo\\" annually and enjoy it each time. On the other hand, \\"Brave\\" is a movie I could have done without and will certainly never watch again. This one just didn't have the Pixar magic we have all come to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that interesting","review":"The movie is boring. There is nothing new or catching. A lot of the standard fairy tale pieces mixed together. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bore with small rip offs of disneys robin hood","review":"Rip off of a few moments from Disney's Robin Hood. BORING, no comedy - poorly executed. Possibly the worst Pixar movie ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, creative and unique","review":"Great tale of a heroine who breaks from her ancestors expectations for her to write her own story. The animation is well done. However, by comparison to films such as \\"The adventures of Tin-tin\\" and \\"Rango\\" the animation is simply convetional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave","review":"My kids absolutely loved it!!

By and large i love this movie, i think its one of pixar's best though i still hold Finding Nemo and Wall-e above it.

There was comedy, tragedy, coming of age a well rounded movie for the young adults out there. I give this movie a high rating because for an animated film it was very down to earth and pulls you into the script without you realizing it is happening.

Put in regular DVD, and there we have what is supposed to happen. Haven't tried the digital disc yet.Would have expected all the discs to work on this. Hopefully a one off, and will revamp this rating if it gets fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"All discs fine except the 3D disc - visible distortion on the disc and will not play without tearing and locking up the Player","review":"Loved the movie and the animation is fantastic - my issues have been with the 3D disc. I have returned and received four replacements all with the same results. I am using this on my internal Lite-On BD Drive with Cyberlink PowerDVD 12 Ultra with latest firmware/software updates and I can play all of my BluRay Movies in 3D with my Asus/NVidia monitor and 3D glasses except this one's 3D disc which in all four attempts I have received from Amazon the 3D disc itself has visible distortion whereas the 2D version in the same packages plays fine and does not have any visible distortion. The 3D discs will all play part way through but will then seize with tearing in the video and will lock up the Cyberlink Software."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable movie!","review":"Very enjoyable movie!

Could have downloaded in less time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rerun, different characters and setting.","review":"The animation and music in this movie are great, other than that, typical Disney princess formula. Princess is unhappy with her lot in life that is better than 98% of the peasants that are around her castle. An adult is making her unhappy, often a parent or step parent. Eventually princess shows some remorse and understanding, but gets her way after causing a lot of chaos. Yawn.... Oh yes, there is as always some kind of villain creeping around, in this case a bear.Also there is some nudity and a young boy that looks like a small bear diving down the front of a woman's dress - great kid fare, right?The best part of this movie at least for me was the witch - oh and the Pixar short \\"La Luna\\" that was before it - now that was a show of real creativity and imagination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy Customer","review":"We received this DVD on time and in perfect condition.

My granddaughter, 3, had seen this and INSISTED on seeing it again. Her parents hadn't see it either (her aunt and uncle took her to the theater), so...we all watched it.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was expecting more..","review":"Wanted to watch Monsters Inc on amazon instant play but it was temporarily unavailable, probably due to the fact that its currently in theaters. So my boyfriend and I settled on this since the comedian Craig Ferguson was one of the voice actors in it, so we expected it to be funny. If you're a 20 year old couple, I don't recommend it. There were some funny moments but it was very slow moving and not what we were looking for. If you want a Disney Pixar movie that's also entertaining, watch Ratatouille!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Delivery In Perfect Condition!","review":"I was so happy with everything!

I thought the movie would be about a strong independent woman like the movie Tangled but it's not. The final battle is not even between the main character and the bad guy. Also the movie was very scary for my 5 year old"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame teen angst movie wrapped in half-assed Scottish mythology","review":"Weak tea. Don't bother. The storyline is insipid and uninspired and entirely predictable. The characters are pretty standard cliches with little (if any) development during the course of the movie. The music is cloying and generic Lilith Fair derivatives. And it really has very little to do with bravery. The art direction and animation is decent but not really anything that we haven't already seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Animated Film of The Year!","review":"Brave is by far the best animated film of the year and deserves the Academy Award.

I hope not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conta-indicated for its purpose","review":"In short I have two main criticisms of this book: 1) The author is quite impressed with herself and I found the examples were more about her than the potential positive impact on the chilren and often there appeared to be some real professional boundaries breached. 2) The focus of the book was on younger children and I was looking for insight related to my 11 and 15 year old nephews."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Novel Is Better","review":"This is basicaly a comic book of the movie. It is okay the graphics are awesome and so is the story line. But a comic book can only be so long. That's why the novel is alot better.If you liked this book, Check out the novel, movie, soundtrack & Video Game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having just seen the movie, my fears were mostly not met from reading this adaptation before the film came out. It mirrors the events in the film, but the dialogue is atrocious, something that is quite a surprise from scribe Peter Milligan (X-Statix). The epic fight between the Punisher and the Russian, one of the best filmed fights in recent memory, is reduced to two pages here. The whole thing seems rushed, with the art being the only saving grace. It may be worth a look for Punisher enthusiasts, but it isn't worth laying down any hard earned cash for. Thankfully, the movie is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks man!","review":"What do you want to know?I already told you it sucks.I mean I bought it and took it home and inside the box there was the wheel broken!Can you belive this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of techniques","review":"This book is worth buying if just for the gallery pictures that line the top of each page. The author reviews a wide variety of metal working techniques and while the instructions aren't thorough enough to stand on their own, there is enough information to introduce you to each method so that you can try it out, or peak your interest to further investigate the techniques using other resources. The photographic illustrations are clear and well-shot and there are tips throughout the book. Pictures of various artists' works are inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got the book no problem - looks awesome","review":"Checked this book out at the library... I liked it so I bought it.Got it in great condition on time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good metalworking book","review":"This book is really good and loaded with lots of information. It also has really neat projects. Lots of photos and easy to understand. I highly recommend this book to someone who is new to metalsmithing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notes of a kind and tenderhearted analyst","review":"The Hungarian analyst Ferenczi was a Freudian, a member of Freud's early circle, and a renegade of sorts. He was Freud's analysand and, relatively quickly, moved into intellectually uncharted psychological waters. He gained a reputation as a passionate, unorthodox, and even flakey analyst. This \\"clinical diary\\" charts with candor, disarming simplicity, and stunning lucidity the thought process of Ferenczi as he discusses his patients, Freud, his own interesting experiences of countertransference, and his highly original and ( especially for their time) unconventional notions regarding the psychoanalyst's rightful and appropriate levels and types of engagement with patients. He was a caring and humane doctor. The writing is complex and layered at times. A very, very worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Wasn't expecting much because of the low price and tremendous number of languages offered, but it was fun. Worked through three languages at the first sitting. Also sent a copy to my grandchildren ages 3 & 7.

Come on!! Even Gerry Dinardo accomplished that twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too-too","review":"The writer of this book leads readers into, well, a mess. The information and ideas are hard to find, let alone grasp. The writing style wanders around the point versus nailing it. A frustrating book. On the same topic, SACRED SPACE by Denise Linn is a much better book because it gets to the POINT much more quickly and is easier to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it at all!","review":"What a bizarre book. It wasn't what I expected at all and had pagan undertones to it. Not sure if that was the intent but it's not what most Christians understand as spiritual. Even says the body is not a temple, the house is. Talks about rituals to free yourself from the past and having friends over to help you by bringing talismans to the altar, etc. Ha If you enjoy that type of thing, this book is probably for you. It just really took me off-guard. It does have some useful actual housecleaning tips mixed in with lists of detail cleaning to do for each room which I enjoyed. I could've done without the psycho-analysis. I much prefer the Sidetracked Home Executive books as well as Shine Your Sink. Those were practical and a bit more normal for where I come from!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zen of Floor Scrubbing","review":"Yes, it's yet another book that promises a spiritual component to scrubbing the bathroom floor on hands and knees! The central message of this book is that you will experience personal growth if you dust every now and again. For people who haven't lifted a duster in years, this may be a ground-breaking insight (possibly literally). However, if you already have an essentially clean house, the best you can hope to find here is assurance that you're bursting with emotional health."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zen Stupidity","review":"If I could rate this book lower than one star, I would. This has got to be the stupidest book I have ever ordered, and now it is definitely going in my re-sale bag.I wanted a book to help me find ways to clean my house--useful ways. I did not expect a book that would try make me aware of my inner beauty through housework. Phooey! Inner beauty is not having to do housework. And what does S&M and pornography have to do with cleaning your house?The practice exercises were even worse. As in preparing altars in your sanctuary. To my husband, this would mean a pile of magazines in the bathroom.Forget it. I'd rather use self-hynosis tapes for relaxation and have a maid clean my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought it for all my Friends","review":"Kathryn Robyn takes this subject to a whole new level. I'm a big fan of Julie Morgenstern's book about organizing. She explains how \\"zones\\" help us stay neat and organized. This book goes yet a step deeper. The author writes about the \\"emotional zones\\" of your life and how they relate (or don't) to the home you've created. I had dozens of epiphanies doing the practice pages at the end of each chapter. Yes, my house is cleaner now, thanks to the author, but it's actually my life problems and the solutions to them that are clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"This little do-lolly is just PERFECT!

It describes all the exiled Jacobite Kings from James II to Henry IX in great detail. It discusses their way of life, their personalities and their motivations. It gives details of all the people that had an efect on their lives and fills out the individuals by telling us of their real characters. All this in an approachable easy read.

I tried both the screw and solder terminal versions of the gold plug replacement from radion shack but the don't really hold the wire still after attached and didn't feel solid. This on the over hand was relatively easy to solder and with the extra support that pinches the wire its a lot better.

Perhaps the subject can not be covered in a single volume as broadly as attempted here, but all the wonder of a beautiful and passionate land is lacking, reduced to a dry recitation of battle history and towns described as, \\"bypassed, church has a Mudejar tower; opposite is mansion with 15th-century door.\\" This is such a shame in that no other series of guides attempts the serious examination of history, art and architecture that the Blue Guides do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinopoli's Death Was a Great Loss","review":"I've said it before, and I'll say it again - every time I listen to a Sinopoli recording, I learn something. Sometimes (as in his \\"Madama Butterfly\\") it's not worth the education, but in others - as in the case of this recording - it's an exhilirating experience. It's too bad that this recording is out of print and hard to obtain, but make the effort; it's lush and exciting and dramatic and terrific. Sinopoli's early death was a great loss; I'd have loved to hear his approach to lots more Strauss and Wagner.

It's part of a whole set of \\"Mais Oui\\" books and CDs. I found it to be the worst textbook I've ever had and I've used many textbooks.

Mountain Rescue has done many fabulous things through not only rescue but also education. Anybody who knows anything about technical rescue will find that the author simply points out mistakes made by other agencies and ignores all mistakes made by Mountain Rescue.

The lion king had a ambitious subordant (a tiger) who wanted to replaced him. One day, the lion king lost his eyeglasses...... I enjoyed the part those who were loyal to the king tried (some were loyal, others wanted to gain benefits for themself) to locate a replacement for the king so the lion can be safe from the tiger.

Mills also talks about a skeptical experience with UFO watchers in the Midlands, but the Mills content does not quite run a full half-hour, with the remaining hour filled with man-on-the-streets Q&As;, a chat with a paranoid conspiracy theorist, a Buddhist parable, and an eccentric old new ager who natters on about nothing discernible.Avoid unless you really want to spend $15 on one brief single-topic conversation with Mills..."},{"rating":"1","title":"completly misleading description","review":"I totally agree with the precedent review (which sadly wasn't online yet when I purchased the audio book version yesterday).

That's probably why, despite the incredible graphics capabilities of PC's sold in the last three years, this thing is slow, slow slow. To do anything but simple tasks is frustrating beyond belief. I found it utterly irritating. You can choose from an existing palette of sinks, cabinets and other items, but customizing them is really not pleasant to do.The good news is that if you fold up the box, you can use it to shim a poorly leveled table. The cd makes a good coaster to protect the finish of the table, but watch for the hole in the center--condensation can drip through and mar the varnish.Save your bucks, skip this one unless you have a high frustration level and a lot of patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Purchase!!!!","review":"Although you are lead to believe from the cover that the original artist perform it isn't the case.

I enjoyed both Simon and Annie so much and loved the development of their relationship during the course of the book. It wasn't frustrating or boring to read at all and kept me flipping pages quickly.

True, the ladders do come off very easy and they can be put on again in one second, but little hands and legs have a way of tripping over themselves and bringing home scrapes and bruises.I think they need to re-engineer the pedals and the pedal travel on the truck. The pedal movement travels in an almost a completely horizontal path. More like two legs pumping rather than pedaling. Further, one complete pedal cycle only moves the truck about a foot. Not the most efficient mode of travel.Still, my son loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instep Fire Truck Pedal Car","review":"The truck is nice and durable my son loved it.!

So one is entitled to have high expectations of the result, particularly when the liner note uses the phrases \\"lovingly remastered\\" and \\"previously unissued recordings\\".In the event what we get is the result of the first five productive 1928 recording sessions (but only one of the three alternative takes), the one title issued from June 1929, the somewhat explicit May Alix vocal from the following month, and a 1923 King Oliver recording on which Noone may have been present. Transfers are adequate although the pitch of the first track sounds flat to my ears, and very little work has been expended on presentation.

It was better when they zoomed in for close-ups but otherwise, it is a truly terrible recording.

The panel didn't disappoint, but I was utterly appalled by the quality of the footage.It was heavily pixilated and completely awkward to watch - I've seen home videos dating back to the 80's with better quality - so to be expected to pay 20$ for this and get such crap quality in return is utterly appalling to me.I can only hope the contribution from me and others who have purchased this DVD will go towards updating the Paley Center's camera equipment so that future panels will be filmed on equipment dating from THIS century.

The author's characters casually toss off any possibility of religious truth.Like the 'DARWIN' fish which swims on bumpers, Mr. Long has used the symbols of belief to belittle the faithful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well thought concept .

This book (Year Zero) is long, boring and depressing as heck at the end. Why should you even care anymore by the end of the book as the world is systematically wiped out by the plague?I'm not giving away any more than the back cover of the book when I say this either - the whole \\"Jesus\\" subplot is left completely unanswered.Really clever idea for a book, but needed someone else to write it. It is just terrible. I have a tendency to finish bad books because some of them develop into ok book, plus there is that \\"already invested\\" feeling. This book was not worth finishing. The bad thing is I apparently ordered Descent at the same time. Oh my..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero believability","review":"I can really only review the first half of the book, because it went in the trash can at that point. It could have been a winner but for the unfortunate lapses into fantasy. It is supposed to be a bio-thriller, but anybody that has any familiarity with the subject is going to find it hard to believe you can clone a completely grown, aramaic speaking jew from a 2000 year old fleck of blood soaked into a splinter of wood. Humanity being less resistant to a virus now than then is also hard to take.I do hope he tries again. He has a good style."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is it?","review":"I don't think Jeff Long really knew where he was going with this one. Lot's of scenes transferred from other works (Outbreak, Cliffhanger, Timeline, Sum of All Fears, Road Warriors, Deep Impact, The Mummy, Seven Years in Tibet, Sparatcus, The Boys from Brazil, etc, etc -- it's a long list). He makes an effort to tie it together, but it doesn't wash. Characterization is good, just good enough to know that you don't really care about the people. He started out with a good premise but sold it down the river in an attempt to reach a higher philosophical level. It didn't work. The dialog is forced and the story, although physically going to a lot of places, really goes in circles and really gets nowhere, climaxing in a soft whoosh. Nothing resolved after much ado about nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome book! But how bout an ending? Forget to write one??","review":"The book was awesome! The adjectives used to describe the surroundings were great! There were many typos in the book, however. Not a biggie. I can overlook that. But, uh.. what about an ending.. the last page left me wishing for another to turn to explain lose ends. Don't buy the book. Borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long can do better","review":"'The Descent' was riveting, scary, and seemed all too real. I was hooked from the first page.Conversely, 'Year Zero' isn't compelling. Having steeped myself in post-Apocalyptic works by reading 'The Stand', I find 'Zero's characters shallow and unsympathetic with the possible exception of Nathan Lee Swift. Ochs is a caricature; there's the requisite deformed mad scientist; a girl genius with no heart at all. (She creates a creature, knowing it will surely be destroyed once discovered.)In attempting to cover a broad period of time and place, the book doesn't dwell for long on one place or one person. The plague itself is never described or shown long enough to create the sense of horror, dread, and end-time that we need to feel.In the end, I could never grab hold of any of the characters for long. In the end, even Nathan Lee shook me off his coattails."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near Zero","review":"This book is utter nonsense. Some scientific mumbo-jumbo, seems the author has read up on some genetics & embryology & then taken that to ridiculous extremes. And some ideas show a complete lack of understanding of scientific concepts (genetic memory, skin cells & nerve cells being the 'same') etc. I couldn't care less about the characters, & the writing is for the most part stilted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull dull dull","review":"Too many plotlines, too much \\"tight\\" editing, and almost completely disinteresting, unbelievable characters doom this book.The apocalypse which the editorial teasers feature so prominently really are secondary plot devices to the primary conceit: the cloning of Jesus. And even that the writer reduces to pulp fiction status with his attempts at fine writing.The Stand and Swan Song are better survival books, and almost anything by Crichton is better than this.Heck, anything by Stine is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing follow-up","review":"Having loved \\"The Descent,\\" I was extremely excited for \\"Year Zero.\\" The opening sequence and the general concept for the novel did not dissapoint. However, Long's efforts to bring the story through 400 pages and to a conclusion become so muddled and misguided that I actually started skimming. None of the conflicts ever rise to a dramatic climax and many storylines are simply forgotten about. Great idea. Terrible execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead end writing","review":"A great idea that went nowhere. I was looking for another \\"The Stand\\" but ended up with a book that has too many sub-plots. It was almost like the author wasn't quite sure which direction he wanted to go with this. Too bad, it started out stong and gave the impression it would be an interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls far short of its initial promise","review":"An interesting premise which starts well. The author starts off with great gusto but appears to just \\"give up\\" at the end. Story lines and characters who appear to be critical to the storyline seem to disappear or fade away without even attempting to tie up loose ends in any meaningful way. And the ending? Please. It was like the author just got tired of writing this story and said, \\"OK I'm done\\". Very unsatisfying. If it was only based on the first part of the book I'd buy every book he writes. But if you can't finish a story in a meaningful way then I doubt I'll ever buy another one of his novels. Too bad. I really had hoped to like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"I agree with the other comments listed earlier. The story line concept is good and the first 200 pages were captivating. Once you past the half way mark, the whole story just collapses. I found the character developement extremely weak. You cant feel for any of the characters. It took me 2/3 into the book to realize who the main characters are. Overall disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Year Zero","review":"The premise of this novel gripped me, yet the multiple plots never seemed to go anywhere. The back cover implies this book is about the clone of Jesus, yet that was not the case. One of the main characters is described early in the book in such a way as to make her seem sociopathic, yet she becomes \\"normal\\" two years later to become Nathan Lee's lover...and yes, I agree about the name! There were just so many avenues this tale could have taken, yet it went in too many unbelievable directions and I found it difficult to follow. It was also difficult to believe that the rest of the world was wiped out, but North America, host to millions of travellers every year, was unscathed until the end. Given the reviews and comparison to Dan Brown's work, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked \\"The Stand\\" by Stephen King","review":"(I wish there were half-star ratings here. I would have given this book 3.5 instead of 4.) The book was similar to \\"The Stand\\" in that there were lots of subplots swimming around, but unlike King's book, these plots never really came together. I think the author tried to put too many (good) ideas into one book; it might have done better as (I hate to say this) a trilogy. The science end of it was interesting, if not as well-researched as some other authors - although I admit science is not one of my strong points, so maybe I'm way off. But, if you like books that mix science, mythology, religion, and archeology - you'll probably enjoy this book. I'd compare it favorably to some of Lincoln Child's books in terms of creativity/ideas, even though the plot doesn't hang together as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I recently finished the school semester and I was looking for a good 'fun' book.

I have found a new favorite author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down....","review":"I began this book and was immediately sucked in. Very easy to read and intriguing story line. It's been awhile since a book has been pulling enough to keep me up all night, but this one did. I was disappointed that the Jesus-clone was even mentioned on the back cover when only a few pages were devoted to him. Also, the plague was described as turning people into peace-loving, mumbling idiots that forget to take care of themselves so it was a bit confusing at the end, when suddenly they were going to make war on Los Alamos...that didn't make sense. HOWEVER, if you can get past that contradiction, this is really an incredible read."},{"rating":"1","title":"year zero rates a zero","review":"This was a very disappointing book. It started out with a fantastic premise - an ancient virus eliminates nearly all of life on earth and desperate scientists try to find a cure at Los Alamos. But it doesn't go anywhere. Jesus Christ is cloned and does ....nothing. This book just doesn't deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This was recommended by Amazon based on my so-called tastes. I was so disappointed. It is not so much a post-apocalypse book as a book on cloning. I pretty much didn't care about anyone in the book - even the female 'lead' character who was beautiful but immoral. And that's what the author seems to be saying: cloning without morals or compassion is evil. I can agree with that, but it doesn't make for a 'good' story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of sound and fury signifying nothing","review":"i found myself fairly engrossed in this book, but by the time I finished it, I felt empty. The plot is great, but then, the author isn't exactly making that up on his own given the fact that it comes from the Bible. I picked this book up hoping for something as engaging as Brian Caldwell's We All Fall Down, but this doesn't even come close to that standard. It's better then Left Behind in that the writing is quite good, but the author just doesn't seem like he has anything to say, no point to make, and that was a big disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real let down","review":"I really enjoyed Long's previous book, and was looking foward to reading this with great anticipation. I was shocked at the poor level of quality of Year Zero. Long writes a simplistic good vs. evil story with no shades of gray and, concequently, no tension or intelligence. If you want to read a great doomsday novel, try The Stand by King or We All Fall Down by Caldwell. Both are intelligent and gripping- two characteristics that this book do not have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours I will never get back","review":"This is the only book in the past twenty years that I have actually stopped reading before I finished it. The prose is amatuerish at best. Mr. Long desperately needs to take some creative writing classes at his local junior college."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Science Fiction","review":"I am sorry but this book is no more Science Fiction than \\"The Stand\\". Unexplained details about the plague and the cloning leave a Science Fiction reader wanting. Also, the villain was contrived and the ending was vague and lacked closure. I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible book for the serious artist.","review":"I am a \\"profesional\\" seascape artist and needed a push to get myself painting again; and perhaps a change of pace.

I hope this helps!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"American Idol Must","review":"Even if you didnt like American Idol, you must admit that they have brought forth some of the most amazing talent that america has seen. This DVD focuses in on the main stars of the show: Ryan Starr, Kelly Clarkson, Christina Christian, Justin,Nikki, and Tamyra Grey. All of these Idols have amazing talent and are doing very well in the music world today. Kelly is still batting out music that is selling by the millions, Ryan Starr has just released another single of hers called \\"My Religion\\" which is doing extremely well on iTunes.

If you think you are going to see any of the great performances, such as Tamyra singing \\"A Fool in Love\\" or Kelly singing \\"Stuff Like That There\\" you are mistaken. They didn't show ANY of the big band performances. If you are a Kelly fan, it is a real waste of money because they don't show very many performances from her. You do get to see Christina captivate the audience with her rendition of \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\". That, along with Tamyra's \\"A House is Not a Home\\" are the only real highlights. Even Kelly's emotionally charged performance of \\"A Moment Like This\\" at the end does not save this DVD. It consisted mostly of behind the scenes which I was not interested in and a background of the judges, again nothing interesting. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIsappointing","review":"Hardly any performances. If you watch this video, you would wonder why the show was such a hit. All of this video could have taken place in 1 night. There was no suspense, no tension of watching your favorite move on or move out. And the 2 DVD set is an even BIGGER disappointment. In Simon-speak, it's dreadfully, absolutely dreadful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Could've Been Better....","review":"This was my first DVD, so initially I was all excited because I didn't know any better. I mean, this had to have been done in a rush. The first season of American Idol had so many wonderful performances and I just don't understand why the makers wanted to be so stingy about supplying us, the fans, with those performances! There is one performance for each finalist except for EJ, AJ, and RJ. There are two performances each for Kelly, Justin, and Nikki. I know Christina Christian didn't make the top three (which she should've) but the DVD would've been much better if there were more performances by her (especially her rendition of Glory Of Love). There are a few group songs that are good, the bonus extras are fine, but the entire thing could've been much better. With the low price, it's still worth buying though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible content, terrible quality","review":"Most of the reviewers have summed up the terrible content of this DVD, so I'd like to comment on the quality of the video footage itself. The sound quality is terrible! I had to watch the DVD with my finger on the volume control the entire time. Basically, it would go from blaring loud to whisper quiet (there were a few scenes that I couldn't hear any of the )conversation with the volume turned way up. Sure, I bet they were in a hurry to get this one out, but don't waste your time and money watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is just highlights.

Instead of showing RJ singing \\"Lately\\" to get into the top ten. They tell you how good of a job he did. Don't waist your money like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite DVDs","review":"In the words of Randy, this DVD, \\"Did it's thang dawg!\\" I absolutely loved it. I only have one complaint about it. First, this movie didn't show many of the performances by the singers (they don't show ANY of EJay's and Jim's performance, not even in the extra features). They should have a section of EVERY performance by all of the singers, even in the Top 30.Overall, this DVD was absolutely amazing. Brain was extremely funny in many sections of the show. I loved that section with the judges (I think it's called \\"When Judges Attack.\\"). Wonderful!But there's one more thing, why don't they have Season 2 and Season 3???"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment!","review":"I purchased this DVD and boy was I disappointed. The production looks like it was a rushed job. Very little content and no substance. The only information I got out of this is that the final contestants of AI2 were so much better than those of AI1. I watched this once and have no desire to watch it ever again.I am looking forward to an AI2 DVD but I hope they would do a much better job than the above-mentioned DVD. Of course being a Clay fan, I hope to see more of him in the DVD.For now, I can only say that the AI1 DVD is a disappointment and a complete waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS SHOW!","review":"Kelly is by far the best picked so far ( besides Carrie, of course)!

Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I was a HUGE fan of the show, and had been excited for this dvd. I wish now though that I hadn't wasted my money. I was hoping for performances, auditions (especially wanted to see the bad ones,) all the stuff that made the show good. What did I get? A thrown together piece of [stuff]. First of all there are only a handful of performances (not even the good ones.) Second, the thing isn't even edited very well. It is just thrown together. It doesn't have performances from everyone, but it had all the cheesy \\"goodbye\\" clips from all the contestants. This DVD could have been great--what were they thinking?!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"American Idol DVD - Not Up To Par","review":"Not enough behind the scenes footage of the contestants. And when will the producers realize that WE DON'T CARE ABOUT BRIAN AND RYAN!!!!!?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off!!!","review":"I just received the DVD as a gift and was hoping to see the ENTIRE SEASON because I had missed a couple of shows. However, it turns out that the DVD just contains some clips of various highlights and omits some of the best parts of AI. I too, was really hoping for Kelly's Big Band Performance and was sorely disappointed. The DVD packaging also claims to have Complete Finalist Auditions and while there are clips of each of the finalists during their original audition, we never get to hear them sing! As for the rest of the songs, forget about it. The choices are odd and some of the best songs were ignored. I can't believe it! It's not like they're going to show reruns, so find someone who taped all the shows and borrow them before you buy this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY","review":"I was so disappointed in this dvd, it's tiny little clips of each show, and not even good clips at that. The bonus dvd, it's [not good] too. They made this for all the 14 year olds who love Justin. So, if you're a 14 year old who loves Justin... this is the dvd for you. Do not assume that this dvd is like the Sex and the City dvd or the 24 dvd, because it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Little Content... Not Worth Buying","review":"I am a big American Idol fan but only saw a few episodes from the 1st season. I bought this DVD because I wanted to find out what happened on the episodes I did not see. This DVD was so disappointing. There is only about an hour and a half of footage and you only get to see a few performances. Really lame!I am so sick of these TV shows putting out \\"highlights\\" DVDs. There is so much more to show and I for one would be willing to pay a lot more for complete seasons (like some shows are starting to do). Even if it is only one disc... you can fit a whole lot more than an hour and a half onto 1 disc.I would not recommend this DVD to anyone. There is so little content and if you watched only a little bit of American Idol last year you are not going to see much more here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focus was wrong","review":"I ordered this video expecting to see a lot more of the contestants singing. Instead the focus seems to be who left the show each week. I feel like I saw more of the hosts than of the contestant's performances. It would have been nice to see more of the great performaces and to hear the contestants singing in the background as they talked about them. 4 of the top ten were not shown giving performances. It would have been nice to see them perform, especially R.J. who finished 5th."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing A lot.","review":"The First Season of American Idol was an amazing season. Far better then any of the other seasons since, but this DVD does not offer enough it is a nice recap of the show but not a good enough look back. I wish they had done it more like the \\"Pop Idol: A Star Is Born\\" DVD in which they go through the whole season quickly but show 4 or 5 of the performances from each week until the Final 5 when all of their final performances are shown. The DVD would be much better had it followed that format. The DVD is still fun to watch but could be better. I wish there were more Nikki McKibbin performance's"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it if you want the memories","review":"If you want the funny outtakes and the memories of the show, buy it.

This DVD is more for the producers of the show than the fans. A quick payday riding on the success of the show. It DOES NOT include all of the songs even of the final 10 contestants. I expected to see the full show or a least the full show for the final ten; but you only get a few songs (Kelly has 4, Christine only 1) and you don't get the judges comments at all. We get to see more of the auditions that we do of the finalists. Wait before you buy, the producers won't miss out on another opportunity to make a buck.

I came across the first season by accident, when I was sitting at home on a Tuesday night, and happened to turn on the tv to FOX. Ryan Star was singing at the time. When I heard that they came out with a DVD on American Idol, I assumed that it would be the ENTIRE SEASON. I was mistaken! Out of the 10 top finalists, you only get to view 5 out of the 10 do at least one solo performance. Kelly and Justin do 3-4, Niki does 2, Tamyra does one, and Christina Richin does 1. The DVD did a lot of recaps and behind the scenes, but still it wasn't enough to be worth while. It's ovious that American Idol is a hit, and the producers should think highly of doing a COMPLETE SEASON set of BOTH the FIRST & SECOND season!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I really didn't care much for the DVD, there needs to be more footage from the show. they only have about 40 minutes of show stuff from a show, that was 2-3 hours a week for over three months.but the bonus features make it worth buying, if you like American Idol.if you're looking for mostly footage from the show, don't buy it.it you're looking for lot's of interesting bonus stuff, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing...content lacking","review":"I was a big fan of the original American Idol show and I was looking forward to re-living some of the best moments. But instead, this turned out to be one of their cheesy highlight episodes that basically shows nothing. It is so lame and a total rip. So many performances have not been included and it's missing the essential judges' reviews. Don't buy if you're expecting to see the whole season that was aired last summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, Who Would Buy This?","review":"I honestly can't fathom who would be the market for a DVD like this. Couch potatoes who long for the glory years of \\"Star Search?\\" Or masochists who want to torture themselves even further by watching these tragically inept performances? \\"American Idol\\" is another nail in the coffin of pop music, endorsing the belief that it's not about how talented you are, but how cleverly you're marketed.

It is far smaller than I expected and feels insubstantial in my hand (and I don't have especially large hands).

Will be getting a set for my wife's XD9 subcompact. You can feel confident about buying this great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in light. Doesn't work in dark conditions","review":"Under lighted conditions, the fiber optic works reasonably well. If you are in a low light indoor condition, don't expect the sights to brightly glow. The serious disappointment is that the two \\"tritium\\" rear yellows barely glow in the dark making the TruGlo virtually impossible to see and thus line up with the green muzzle light. There is no way the extra feeble glow of tritium can be used in a defensive condition.I wrote to the company but have not heard back yet.

I took them to my gunsmith and had them installed. Come to find out, the front sight is not glowing at all and the back sights are about half as bright as other TruGlo TFO sights I have installed on other guns. Tritium glows for 5 to 12 years depending on the color and these sights might have been old. They are installed now and it's too late to send them back. They will still work well but just not in darkness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and switch-don't bother ordering","review":"This price is well below standard pricing.

While Womansword gives all sort of interesting analysis of interesting words and situations, it will not help you at all doing what most newcomers to Japan want to do, which is to either make friends or lovers out of those Japanese who are not English speakers. Making out in Japanese is simplistic, but it is a non-threatening, easily employed tool for making those first and very difficult steps into the forbidding Japanese language. When I started Japanese, almost a decade ago, I read it for entertainment, and it helped me learn. It got left behind as I went from a beginner to an intermediate speaker of Japanese, but I remember it fondly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep, throoughly useful book","review":"I have to admit, I really detest books along the lines of Making Out inJapanese, which purport to teach you Japanese love-slang, for the simplereason that they are insulting to any reasonable person's intelligence.Womansword, by Kittredge Cherry, is much better. An exhaustive yetapproachable \\"pop study\\" of Japanese vernacular, this thin, smart bookgoes beyond basic sexual words, and instead takes on words and idiomsthat exist (or once existed) in Japanese, which tell about therelationship of women in Japanese society.

Gone in a week after two waterings. And I noticed major new plant growth in that time. So I thought having a gallon of this stuff will help keep them going. Turns out this one only has the soluble potash and chlorine in it. It doesn't have the other most important stuff, like the nitrogen and phosphorus. I saw absolutely no new plant life. So I ended up dumping what I didn't use down the sink. The other review said this stuff is the missing ingredient to any garden, but it certainly has some ingredients missing from it. Now I think before you buy any Maxicrop Seaweed item, e-mail the seller and check to make sure the one they carry has all four major ingredients in it: nitrogen, phosphorus, soluble potash, and chlorine. Maybe add a little epsom salt for magnesium sulfate too for good measure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader of Barbara Cartland's books","review":"When I found out this movie was based on a book by Barbara Cartland, I bought it right away.

The mood was there but it was missing any scenes that should have make me jump in my seat. One thing puzzled me is that when the leading character decides to spend a very long day and night at the haunted mansion,all he takes is a little food that he is gven and (it appears) nothing to drink.

This is neither creepy nor scary; it's just annoying.The plot of The Woman in Black is pretty weak to begin with, and the film does nothing to add substance to Susan Hill's shallow tale in which the weather is the most interesting character of all. Radcliffe is unimpressive, and while he is good enough to portray the one-dimensional Harry Potter, as Arthur Kipps he simply goes around moping the entire movie, failing to make us believe in the supposed heartache he is experiencing.On the production side, the film is well made; The cinematography sets a good atmosphere, and the house is perfectly creepy as the main location for the plot.

Remind you of any other movies???The movie was very slow and featured things moving in front of the camera followed by a loud noise. No chances taken and very few interesting story elements make this movie run-of-the mill.

Whereas Robert Pattinson was amazing in Water For Elephants and proved he wasn't just another teen heartthrob with no acting ability, Radcliffe looks spoiled and frustrated in this film.

As for the movie itself, it was a disappointment. Too many \\"scare tactics\\" to appeal to a younger audience. If the movie would have stayed true to the book, it whould have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-Use of a Promising Young Talent","review":"I purchased this item from Amazon. Reviewer Linda Pagliuco says it very well. Yes, there is the creepy house -- very well done -- excellent lighting, or rather, non-lighting. The Gothic theme played to the hilt. But it seems like there is very little acting for Daniel Radcliffe to actually do. Yes, his Arthur character is brave to the point of being foolhardy. And Radcliffe plays the part well. But there doesn't seem to be much to it. I bought it mainly to see him, but I also wish to give credit to the other actors. Ciaren Hinds especially is very sympathetic and I like the job he did. But I still was underwhelmed with the story as a whole. Finally, I was dissatisfied with the ending -- too awful in some ways, too \\"Hollywood\\" in others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Fashioned - Better than Expected","review":"I liked the original woman in black - wasn't happy to see a remake being made - and really wasn't happy that Daniel Radcliffe was in it. I apologize. Daniel does a fine job. The movie is a good, solid remake of old time horror films where imagination provides the chills more than gore and shock (though there was a bit of both). Our family all really enjoyed it. If you are a fan of the old movie you'll probably like it. If you liked the original version of THE HAUNTING you'll probably like this. It was a good ghost story, and I'll probably buy it for my collection. If you like slasher movies, gore, or shock-fests this will be too slow for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a good movie","review":"I liked how Daniel Radcliffe did a very good job at not being Harry Potter.

(See the photo of the DVD, that's the face he holds throughout the movie, except when he speaks) No scares, no suspense, no connection to characters. One of the most boring ghost movies I have ever spent time viewing (result=dozing off)."},{"rating":"1","title":"So lame!","review":"I really wanted to love this movie! I saw Daniel R. on the Graham Norton show promoting this movie, and Daniel seems Soo like-able. I was really rooting for him & the film ...

Although the sets were fantastic and the watery setting was very nice, all the people in the film lack character. Oh, sure you learn about their pasts, but no one develops or changes much.This is especially true for the movie's main villain. It's just an evil thing. Sure it has motivation, but there's no chance for redemption or resolution. The first 90% is good spooky entertainment. The last bit is high budget indie laziness disguised as high concept. It's more a record of events than a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy","review":"Imagine a 30+ room mansion with empty rooms and dark lonely passages lit only by candle light. Now imagine you are alone there when inanimate objects are not exactly what they seem to be. Further, also imagine the mansion is in the middle of nowhere and is connected with the mainland only by a narrow stretch of road that goes underwater with high tide. This is the setting and it requires some imagination to enjoy it fully.

I like gothic horror stories and had high hopes. Alas, throughout the picture I predicted what was going to happen next with complete accuracy--it was that predictable. The ending stunk. This was a movie more in the same caliber as something you would see on Chiller or SyFy channel on television. Boring. Not worth time or money.

It attempts to recreate the classic Gothic ghost story from the 1800's and it succeeds wonderfully -- this is a hella scary book, steeped in Gothic atmosphere and slowly but deliberately paced. Honestly, it will creep you out. But somehow, this movie f***s it all up, despite being an otherwise well made flick. I've read the book, twice, but even with that I couldn't follow the movie, as so much as been \\"re-imagined.\\" And it's no longer a scary ghost story, just a muddled flick with some wanna-be scary graphics.

But I was sorely disappointed. About 30 minutes into it, I was wondering WHEN in the heck it was going to end. It was one of the most boring movies I've seen in quite a while and the entire story could have been told in a 15 minute short film. The atmosphere was creepy as was the old mansion....that's about it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's really dull","review":"Daniel Radcliffe, a Hollywood pretty boy can't act his way out of a paper bag, and the flim is about as scary as an M.

I couldn't stay awake to save my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but nothing particularly special","review":"I rented this movie from Redbox because the trailer had looked interesting. The acting and premise of the movie were promising, but the story seemed underdeveloped. Daniel Radcliff ventures to a mysterious small town where the people seem to want to get rid of him as quickly as possible. We learn this is because of a local superstition that results in the death of the town's children. Sounds interesting enough, but the story tends to drag, and there isn't really anything to differentiate this movie from others in the genre. Throughout the movie we see similar sequences played over and over--a good portion of the movie is just Radcliff walking around a house.The story falls short and does nothing to invigorate an already stale genre. This movie is worth a rent at best, which is unfortunate because I was looking forward to seeing Radcliff in a new role."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh, scares too cheesy","review":"I usually like somewhat dark movies, but this was definitely not one of my favorites. The movie seemed to go for screaming in your face type scares instead of trying to be a deeper psychological thriller. It had the makings of a good movie, but the scares were too heavy handed and not thought provoking. This reminded me of going to a carnival haunted house. Not really my thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate a bad ending - spoiler galore!","review":"Right in the middle of watching this movie on TV I was loving it so much (for I love classic gothic ghost stories without all the gore) I felt compelled to see if I could purchase it here. I almost purchased it before finishing watching it and I am now glad that I waited, for I hate bad endings. Who cares if he and his son were reunited with his dead wife in the afterlife, after being killed by the woman in black?! They were still killed and the ghost goes on, free to kill again and again. For me, catharsis is very important in watching a movie, and I never experience catharsis, with a bad ending, when the hero gets killed. This move was excellently made and delightfully scary, but I will never want to watch it again, and especially will not want to own it because of the let down of the bad ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this movie to be odd and very disappointing.

It was terrible, my friends still prod me for suggesting it. I'm a huge horror and Hammer fan and this movie is just long, boring, and hard to get through, it's one of those movies that strings you along for what seems like endless hours, you keep thinking somethings going to or got to happen at some point, it just never does. It's just not a good film. The atmosphere, costumes, period and look of the film are great, and I suspect people that gave it favorable ratings have never seen any good 50's, 60's or 70's gothic horror, or they are Danial Radcliffe fans, the acting, atmosphere and cinematography of this film are above average, but the film is just long boring and forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I love this movie and it came in a good ammount of time.

I only saw this movie due to curiosity about how Daniel Radcliffe would look as someone other than Harry Potter.

BUT the movie just NEVER draws the viewer into it. All the \\"scary parts\\" rely on standard formulas - something moving in the background (that the hero never sees until it's too late) or something popping up suddenly (BOO!).It is just totally flat - one note - no depth at all.

Some of the etudes sound like five-finger exercises and some of the preludes have rather pallid echoes of Bach. If you don't particularly like the guitar, I would pass. But if the potential wildness of the instrument appeals to you at all, there is plenty here to reward your listening.

There are so many characters written into the book, the story becomes convoluted. The authors also feel they have to explain ever little detail of every minor character. Boring... All the major characters are very one dimensional: rich, spoiled, power hungry, hardly a redeeming trait among any of them.

Someone along the line in turn borrowed it from me. I've been searching libraries and book stores for a copy ever since. I've read and re-read all of Bunker's other fiction. This is his best, in my opinion. If you've only seen the movie, \\"Straight Time\\", you have no sense of the grit and immediacy of the book. Nothing's for show and you're under the surface scum of the streets of L.A.. I titled this a masterpiece of crime, but like any true masterpiece it transcends the genre is simply,a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"A crime-novel from a man who knows the inside of the criminal mind. This book is interesting both as a social study and as a suspense novel. Bunker does not keep his punches, and he writes with brutal honesty.

A great book, no matter how you look at it. This should be something they make the kids read in highschools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Authentic Bunker at his best","review":"Written while awaiting parole, Bunker's experience lends his characters an uncannily authentic feel. It brings to mind films like 'Heat' - the robbery that goes wrong. Bunker's brilliance is making his lead character ugly yet engaging.

Having read about the author, Edward Bunker, it is astonishing what he achieved despite all the hardships throughout his life.Bunker clearly is (or, rather, became) a skilled writer. Apparently he based this novel on his own life so that it is semi-autobiographical. For those who are unfamiliar with his type of life, it is disturbing but it is very real.

Unfortunately, it is very weak on content. The rewards from plodding through the often unnecessary information are minimal. Fieldhouse tries to protect himself in the introduction by saying that such phrases as the 'West' and 'Third World' are not accurate. This is true, but he writes as if he can use them anyways. He writes a chapter on East Asia after having admitted to not know anything about it. His conclusion states, basically, that the countries that did well all had good governments. No kidding. An experienced scholar might find some interesting arguments in this, but authors such as P. McMichael make this book look to be, well, openly incorrect.

The beauties of Bach can only be appreciated by a listener to this performance if he knows the piece well and can complement what he actually hears with what he remembers from past hearings. I heard mostly the third movement. To say \\"I heard it\\" is an exaggeration; I noticed it, whoosh, racing past me.

The author is obviously putting his own political leftist views into his view of the war. The author simply spews out outrageous claims with no factual data to back it up. I, being a centrist and not left/right leaning, found this book to be a biased attempt by a leftwing author to denegrate the accomplishments of the US in their attempts to solve problems in this complex world. Based on the authors views the US is responsible for the world's problems. Total BS coming from a guy who probably benefits from the global policies of the country he denounces so readily. The most amazing part of the book is that if he really believes the crap he writes he should get the heck out of here and move to an eastern block or middle eastern country."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Unbelievably bad. The author is suffering from terminal paranoia. He believes that the media suffered irreparable damage during the Gulf War because they didn't have access to all the information they wanted from the military. It doesn't occur to him that the media, with their blatant liberal slant, can't be trusted to handle information and report it responsibly. This is the same who thinks that Ted Turner is \\"courageous\\" - the same bigoted Ted Turner who's been nailed time and again for hypocrisy. Lastly, MacArthur has virtually no technical academic or professioanl credentials to make many of the satements he does regarding military technology. His assessment of weapons such as those used in the Gulf War is pathetically inept. Don't waste your money.

My pleasant surprise was that the translator managed to capture, in Spanish, Junie's funny gift for mangling words and meanings a bit. Like all great translations, it captures the sense and impact of the original work rather than going for word-for-word direct translation.I just wish more of the series was translated!

It has become a great friend.The type-setting is crystal-clear. The edition notes are instructive. The pages never fall out, even if you crease the spine to keep the book flat against the piano stand.Then, of course, there's the glorious music itself. So much magnificent music in one volume.

Exploding out and about in America with their touring with old labelmates of 7-10 Split and Officer Negative. You may have also seen them on a split EP with Officer Negative also. The band is making alot of noise in America lately and expect more to come. Employing punk rock passion and energy with intentions of capturing the aggression and intensity of late hardcore scene of the 80s, while offering the melodic elements of other forms of other punk. If you enjoy old fashion 80s punk rock then you'll enjoy this great mind blowing full length by this band from the down and out of NC. This is a must for any fans of GBH, old old NOFX, Anti-Flag or just punk rock in general. The Combat Junkies are now called The Executed, so better pick up this and their 2nd CD while you still can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser MX300 earbuds","review":"These are great -- even a non-audiophile like me can tell these are much better than the earbuds that usually come packaged with CD and MP3 players. They produce a rich, clear sound, and you don't have to jack up the volume to hear your music well. The MX300s are a cheap upgrade that will really improve your portable music experience.

This indispensable, seminal work is concise, but far-reaching. It describes the varied manifestations of gender diversity in a way that permits the reader to perceive the patterns and deeper meanings that underlie cultural differences. This may be the first cross-cultural survey of gender diversity to describe \\"the trees\\" in such a balanced and objective way that the reader may see and understand \\"the forest.\\" Anyone interested in the deeper, changeable nature of human sexuality will find this book to be both provocative and illuminating.

If so, Helen Greaves must truly have been clairvoyant, as \\"Testimony of Light\\" was written in 1968, 30 years before Sylvia began publishing her excellent books.I found this book very useful, almost as a text book on how to prioritise one's life on earth. It reinforces what many of us already intuitively know about \\"life after death\\", but more importantly, it gives our vague thoughts on the subject structure and depth, allowing us to grasp what we already know much more firmly, and build on these firmer foundations.It's easy reading (albeit somewhat slow and heavy for the first 15 pages) but it's worth reading the forewords and introductions and it does put the characters in context."},{"rating":"2","title":"A hopeful spiritual orientation for all to consider!","review":"A hopeful spiritual orientation for all to consider!I have read this book twice now and I have found both readings quite enjoyable!

We do take our emotional \\"baggage\\" with us, but are given loving assistance to resolve issues and let it go so we can rise in vibration to greater heghts and service. And in some cases return to earthliving to fulfill certain dreams or unfinished business.The book is full of inspiring and informative individual stories, and as a psychotherapist I was happy to learn that the work I do here to help people clear their emotional pain (quickly, with some of the newer methods) is helping them not only in this life but to have a better afterlife.

The camera worked ok and the pictures were of good quality, though it took a second or two or three to actually take a picture after pressing the button. The menues and operation were effective but crude and slow - have to keep turning the display button on and off when switching from display to shoot.

It is not pop-history, but well reasoned military analysis. Mr. Glantz was himself an authority within the U.S. Army on Soviet doctrine and military history. The book itself is probably the best one-volume treatment of the Soviet war effort against the Germans during World War II, though the reader should keep in mind that Glantz himself is a big admirer of the Soviet way of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good resource for history buffs","review":"This is not light history reading but an in depth recounting of the massive conflict of the Ostfront. Plus the price was great and the delivery was even speedy. I'm enjoying chipping away at this book, chapter by chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I'm not sure who this book would really appeal to. It seems too brief and compact to appeal to scholars or military history buffs. The text is utterly lifeless, so it wouldn't appeal to fans of narrative history. I know it has great virtue in the fact that it examines the conflict from almost exclusively the Soviet point of view, but I'm amazed that such a dramatic story as this could have such a boring presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dense, dense, denser","review":"Colonel Glantz's reputation preceded him, and so I bought this book, expecting a major work describing the war on the Eastern Front. Coming in at about 300 pages, archival it isn't. However, it is written in the deadest prose I have encountered in a long time, with endless shopping lists of manouvres, and very little of the big picture. Detail is great, but repetitiveness of this degree is excruciating. Too many facts maketh Jack a bad story teller, and surely, the art of writing well is to sift out useful facts from trivial ones. I can make as good a claim as anyone to being being spellbound by the Russian front, but this book reads like a not very original Master's thesis. 62% for the thesis, and 45% for daring to publish in the general domain. Money back time, I'm afraid. This book has gone in pristine condition to the nearest charity. A terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Incomplete","review":"The #1 reason Germany lost that front was due to one simple reason : 4 of the top ten German officers had become traitors and gave the Soviets all the german iformation. \\"Lucy\\" and \\"Werther\\" (code names for the two top informants) began to give Stalin any and all information ( probably due to moral reasons, as the army never approved of Hitler's radical policies). \\"Lucy\\" was a top german general and \\"Werther\\" was either Jodl, Bormann or Keitel...we will probably never know which of the 3 men Werther was, as Russia keeps its secrets locked. In fact, after the war, Zhukov admits Stalin asked for a surrender in late 1941, but the message never got to Hitler. Stalin did get a reply from a german officer, and from that, Stalin decided not to surrender, not to flee Moscow , and instead- fight the end. Zhukov did not know what that reply was, but it is at the same time Stalin began getting his German informants to tell all. This is what happened, and why Germany lost the Eastern front."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with Glantz, but...","review":"While I agree this is an excellent account by Mr. Glantz of the German-Soviet war in World War II, I disagree with at least one point. Almost everyone, including Mr. Glantz, thinks that Germany could not have won a protracted war with Soviet Rsssia. Yet the German economy was actually larger than the Russian economy going into the war. Germany possessed or had access to far more natural resources, including electricity, coal, and iron ore (to make steel) than did Russia. While it's true that Russia made better use of its natural resources in turning them into military weapons like air planes, tanks, and artillery, that doesn't mean that Germany couldn't have produced the same or more war materials had Hitler gone to a strict war economy as did Russia.

It keeps drinks hot (and cold) for a very long time, it's handy, easy to hold, and very easy to clean (which is the great flaw in the otherwise excellent Oxo Good Grips LiquiSeal Travel Mug Stainless Steel tumbler). The problem with the Nissan? The lid. It's not--and does not purport to be--leak-proof, which would have been a nice addition. The lid flips out of the way, but it's still easy to bump into it and get a drop of coffee on your nose if you've been sloshing the contents around.

A cup of coffee will stay warm for at least 2-3 hours.

I work at home, so I don't need to take this tumbler out. I assume one would have to always hold it in one hand or put it in a car's cup holder. Since it is not leak-proof it cannot go into a backpack of briefcase unless it is empty. I think it is ideal for use in the home or office, rather than during commute. Hot water/tea stays really hot for 1-2 hours. If hot liquid is left in the tumbler without frequent drinking, it will still be lukewarm for up to 6-7 hours afterwards.

It's not just small drips -- a steady stream of water just gushed out from the place where the flip top hinge was.I don't know if I just got unlucky because I received a defective product or something, but after the test I immediately placed the item back in the box and printed a return label.The tumbler itself didn't look bad.

However after having it for over a month and using it almost every day for coffee and tea drinks that sometime include milk or cream, I noticed that there was slime coming out from under a rubber gasket at the top of the cup between the plastic flange and the steel cup body. I tried to clean it out but its not possible to get at it to fully clean it out and I can still see some debris stuck just under the edge that I can't remove. Without a doubt this gets into what I'm drinking once it heats up, not appetizing to say the least so I don't use this mug anymore. My next step is to try and get a refund from Amazon.

If you overfill when you screw the cap down you get spill over and this can be quite messy.

Even when screwed shut and clicked shut there is a gap so my tea leaks every time I get in and out of the car. I'm not even talking about leaving it horizontal. Slightly tilt your full tumbler and you will get wet. Works for the desk but that's it. I would return it but I don't have the original packaging any more. C'est la vie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cup leaks","review":"Cup leaks out of the top closure part. I need one that does not leak at all, most of the time my hands are full and it's a balancing act.

HOWEVER, after a year of use, we noticed a funky smell from inside the cup. No amount of washing would get rid of it. Then we noticed if we pushed the rubber ring seal on the inside of the mug, black mildew oozed out from underneath the seal. There is no way to clean the gunk from under the gasket/seal, so we had to toss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good! Recommended for caffeine commuters.","review":"Some friends gave this to me as a gift and I quite like it! It fits right in my VW's persnickety cup holders and keeps coffee warm for hours, far longer than any other stainless-steel mug or tumbler that I've had, even other glass-lined ones! It's quite sturdy, cleans up easily, and looks cool, too. I didn't give this a five-star rating only because I've seen lids that are better designed than and not as flimsy as this one, though this one is perfectly functional.

Keeps hot for hours.The drink flap snaps closed and opens easily, which is a problem with a lot of other tumblers.If what you need is a travel tumbler, this one will do the job.As a side note: If fitting in your car's cup holder isn't an issue, the 14-oz Nissan Coffee Mug for Desktop is THE very best mug I've ever bought.

I use them every day, as I am a traveling nurse and these tumblers keep my drinks cold for 6-8 hours.

Also, the tumblers don't sweat. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For long-lasting warm drinks","review":"I love this thermos! I had been searching for a thermos for a long time and I finally stumbled across this one. It keeps my tea or coffee warm for several hours. The drink spout snaps back to allow you to drink fromt he spout. The grip in the middle is very good and allows for a sturdy grip. The only negative thing is that it is a little bit heavier than most thermoses, but I think it's because of the material it is made out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Spiller!","review":"My friends said Nissan was the best and I was so excited to be able to travel with my coffee. I am a painter and like to work in the landscape here Colorado. Having my hot coffee made painting in cold weather bearable but on seriously cold days below 30 degrees the mug just did not stand up to it; and leaky. I could not be careful enough with this darn thing and my equipment, clothes, and bag have the spills to prove it. It should be called the Spiller, not the Tumbler. Hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best tumbler.....period","review":"I've owned two of these for years and they're still as functional as they were when they were new. They've been abused - dropped, washed in the dishwasher, knocked over - and the only difference is the dents that have been caused. They still maintain a tight seal and keep beverages very hot. I've given them as gifts to lots of people and everyone has always been super impressed with their insulation quality. I'll sometimes use a plasitc tumbler outside to save on the abuse my Nissan has taken, but it's not worth having your coffee get cold in 15 minutes - especially in the winter. I'll never buy an insulated tumber other than Nissan!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DEEPER STILL US TRULEY \\"MUSIC FOR AND FROM THE HEART\\"","review":"I ordered this album a couple of weeks ago and today it came in the mail. I sat down to sit back and enjoy....and wow!!!!! I was blown away by her vocals, poetic lyrics, and above anything...a tale of survival in an everchanging and not very kind world. Her songs on this collection run the full length of emotions....WORLD OF HURT which is basically her take on society at large and finding love in such a complicated universe as ours. ANGELS BY MY SIDE tells how she has been able to overcome so much pain and strife by believing someone is watching over her.....SHAKE MY SOUL is my favorite track with backing vocals by Bonnie Raitt and Annie Roboff...and the two closing tracks ALL FOR THE LOVE and THERE'S A LIGHT (backing vocals by Emmylou Harris) ends a wonderful album on an upbeat note....the note and moral being \\"THERE IS ALWAYS HOPE\\". If you want to be swept off your feet musically, savor this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unspeakable loveliness!","review":"I wanted to rate this CD 5 stars, but I think that rating should be reserved for rare works that truly stand far above the run of the mill. This one is close, but rates only 4 in my book because, despite the extremely moving tunes and gorgeous lyrics, Beth Nielsen Chapman is only an average vocalist.This is an extremely moving CD from beginning to end. It might not lift your heart, but it will stir your soul. And art is about moving you in some way, even if it is not always upbeat and happy.Other reviewers have commented on the famous singers who have lent thier talents to back-up vocals. This, I think, is a tribute to the strength of the material that Ms. Chapman has created.Other reviewers have also commented on indvidual songs. The one that moved me most is called, \\"Sleep\\" as I recall. On it, Ms. Chapman sings of \\"The same heartcrushing sorrow, the same unspeakable loveliness... all at the same time.\\" These lyrics could describe the entire CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, searching","review":"This is basically a quiet, reflective CD. This is what one would expect from Chapman but given recent events in her life there is a new depth and sadness in her music. Most will agree that she is known better as a songwriter than a singer. Still, she has a lovely voice and writes great music. This is late night music. Its for thinking and dreaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL COMES DOWN TO LOVE","review":"Chapman is an insightful, intelligent songwriter who draws from personal experiences to create vivid and emotional songs.DEEPER STILL explores the loss of her husband and her own battle with cancer. The songs are both life-affirming and bittersweet. Beth is vocally supported by artists like John Prine, Vince Gill, Bonnie Raitt and Emmylou Harris. My favorite cuts: Every December Sky, All Comes Down to Love, Sleep and There's a Light.Chapman sings with conviction and heartfelt emotion, sharing her soul with her audience---the sign of a true artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays MPEG4 + MP3's + Streaming Media!!","review":"Just got this.

I upgraded the firmware on the thing and now it plays everything.I highly recommend this. But get an extended warranty since some people say that it might fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, not fully baked","review":"It's a nice concept if done right.. I found this unit to have some big drawbacks.- Requires special Windows PC server software, rather than being able to access a standard file share. So, it will not work with Macs or Linux machines.- The user interface is not very intuitive or flexible (e.g. no MP3 playback while displaying images, which would make for a nice slideshow feature).- JPEG image display would greatly benefit from 720p or 1080i display modes. 480p is not good enough to do most pictures justice.- The media files available for playback are limited. MPEG Video files are limited to 3Mbps streaming rate. So, if you plan on playing your MiniDV home movies that were exported to MPEG/DVD format, forget about it. Also, it will only allow playback of files on the hard drive of the windows machine, it will not allow you to add MP3/MPEG files from a network share."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Wireless Support","review":"Maybe it works with some of the wireless cards out there, but who can justify purchasing one model after another from their \\"supported\\" list until you find one that really works? I purchased a Belkin F5D6020 after seeing it on their \\"supported\\" list, only to find out that not all versions of the F5D6020 are supported. Did they bother to indicated that though? No! So I'm stuck with a \\"supported\\" card which doesn't work. I'm not about to continue to purchase \\"supported\\" cards in the hope that I might just get lucky and get one that really works. They really missed the boat with their documentation and tech support on this product..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes some work to get configured, but is well worth it","review":"I initally tried to get it to work with my wireless lan (802.11b). Everything played, but the video was a little \\"blocky\\". I didn't have the funds to buy a new 802.11g router, so instead I hardwired the dvd player on a 100 mbit network. Everything now plays flawlessly, including mpeg1, mpeg2, and mpeg4/divx.Its able to play Shoutcast radio streams using software called \\"twonkyvision\\" (search for it on google). That was a big plus for me.As for the dvd functions, its a great dvd player for the price. Its got progressive scan and all of the outputs you would need.Oh yeah, someone else mentioned this, but make sure you update the firmware on both the client and server or else things won't work right. That firmware can be downloaded from govideo's website.I'm very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with a firewall and the music interface is bad.","review":"Player installed just fine but will not work with a firewall on the server computer. Called tech support and they told me they are telling their customers to disable their firewalls. I find that absolutely amazing in this day and age.The interface for playing music will show you albums without the artists names, artists without the album names or playlists that display song titles without artist or album information. With a ripped CD collection of over 500 titles and without the ability to identify what I'm listening to I find this to be only of use for background listening.I'm a tech junkie so I'll hang on to this for the time being, but I'm certain this device will soon be overshadowed by something more capable and intuitive that provides for network security as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Able? not Cain!","review":"OMG this was bad. Sappy, cringingly bad lyrics (see \\"Shine on Chicago\\").While his arena rock pedegree is sure to lure in some fish, this disc is so poor Jon makes horrific 70's singer-songwriter Dan Hill sound like a rock god.The best I can say is that at times his vocal tones mimmicked a poor man's Jules Shear, but that would be too cold a slap in the face to polar bear fans from North to South.But Cain a major talent? ...more like the world's smallest pianist.I did enjoy his nostalgic spin on \\"Faithfully\\"; a duet with Mica Roberts, but overall \\"WHERE I LIVE\\" was not a sentimental journey.\\"Sometimes She Breaks\\" and sometimes she breaks wind, either way this CD blows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Kettle roasted is not what these are.

That novel is one of the most riveting I've ever read, and I was looking forward to see this film. Yet Olivier played the Hurstwood character all wrong; he lacked the smooth bravura of the man who originally seduced away the Jennifer Jones character from her earlier lover played by Eddie Albert. Eddie Albert's performance, incidentally, is the only one that comes close to what Dreiser wrote. And Jennifer Jones gives us a Carrie who is sympathetic and nice, and Dreiser's Carrie is neither. This is one of those occasions where you wonder why they bothered to acquire the rights to the novel if they had no intention of realizing it accurately as a movie. Take my advice, and read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carrie, the 1952 movie based on Dreiser's novel Sister Carrie","review":"Amazon Prime should be congratulated for having this movie in their selection; it is very well directed and superbly acted and follows Theodore Dreiser's novel \\"Sister Carrie\\" quite well. I watched it to help me write a paper on this novel, which shows how our consumer society, by making people aware of their unsatisfied desires and channelling those desires into the pursuit of consumer goods, demoralizes the human spirit. I recommend it to any student of American Literature or history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jennifer Jones review","review":"I just love the way she speaks and acts.

It . . is. . . fantastic. The game itself just gets better and better, with every addition. Kinship and individual housing is on the way (It won't clutter the landscape, they are going a different route), there's PvMP which gets rid of the negative portions of PvP, but has all the fun of playing as an evil race, as well as PvP. There is the epic chapter quests. There's the Middle Earth Lore (I've been reading the books since I was a child, and study Quenya and Sindarin, so yeah, I think I know what I'm talking about). Just a fantastic adaptation all around, for the MMO Genre.

MMO's have undergone various transformations since EQ1. Dark Age of Camelot, Star Wars: Galaxies, Shadowbane and Everquest 2 - there have been many pretenders to the throne originally held by the original Everquest. Then along came World of Warcraft - and other MMO's paled by comparison. World of Warcraft is still sitting pretty at the top of the MMO mountain, but Lord of the Rings is making a game effort to get there.However, there are some weaknesses in the game. Tradeskills are tied to professions as opposed to being standalone entities. As with all MMO's, grouping is a bit hit or miss, although the loot tables are significantly beefed up compared to other games.All in all, LOTRO really does cater to the casual gamer better than any other MMO currently available. However, as the game matures and new content is released ... that may change"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't purchase wrong version!","review":"I think this is a good solid fantasy MMO that you will enjoy if you like solo and PVE play. It is weak on PVP. The crafting system is moderately complex.I bought this item thinking that I could start a new account with this software, but I cannot.

The best thing I can say about it was the initial character creation screens were very in depth. So in depth, that you can expect to skip it altogether and choose a preconfigured character to get started in a timely fashion the first time out. It had the feel of a single player game with good narration and limited social interaction. If you're like me, playing WoW while you wait for the next interesting MMO to come out, you can rest easy choosing to save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money on this...","review":"...Unless you like endless hours of grinding for crafting materials and gold to pay the insane costs of everything. Or like being constantly under attack just traveling from point A to point B. Or like Boss fights where you're always fighting hordes of adds. Or like to be endlessly stunned, disarmed, crippled, snared, poisoned, bled, diseased or otherwise impeded whenever you fight anything. Did I mention the quests that have you running all over Eriador taking hours to do just for a few experience points and crappy rewards?Getting to level 50 is long and frustrating because in order to level reasonably fast you need to do the quests and most of the quests require a 6 person group to do, and it's difficult to get such a group together. Leveling up solo is your only other option and that takes a tremendously long time to do.So... If you like being frustrated and bored then this game is for YOU!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite WoW","review":"This is a nice attempt by Turbine to compete with Blizzard's World of Warcraft. It runs OK with a good gaming system, but no where near the smoothness of WoW. There are loads of quests to do and many are soloable. I was not happy with the monetary system, but few MMORPGs get that right. The tradeskill system is a bit overcomplicated, but if you really like the trades in these games, than this is the one for you.

And unlike some series that would be overall flops but for one or two brilliantly good elements, this one simply has no redeeming qualities.

The book also contains many useful forms and worksheets -- most in .doc format on the accompanying CDROM.Although she encourages readers to seek beyond the text about learning styles, I am a bit concerned that she hasn't employed nor discussed more learning styles that cover some other issues regarding how students best learn. Also the chapter on technical tips was lacking, covering only tips for early students and also giving vague details about how to these techniques work and function. The section would be very helpful if it were boosted and given more attention. These shortcomings are minor, however, and do not detract from the usefulness of the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on the Run","review":"I actually use this for my Creative Zen MP3 player.

I was hoping that the return of Maddy Prior to the group would change the downward spiral, but alas, it did not. Babylon's tracks are limp and uninvolving, the music and the vocals sound so flat and lifeless it's disconcerting. It's almost like listening to New Age Lite music. I must reluctantly content myself with going back to their earlier work and living in the past glories of Steeleye Span's music. At one time, these people were the best at what they did; that time has passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Olympic Elk is a family classic","review":"My father referred to the classic Disney film \\"Olympic Elk\\" for several years. When the video finally became available on DVD, I bought a copy for him, and one for myself.This film follows the life cycle of the elk which reside in Olympic National Park. The animal photography is excellent, especially considering the time it was produced. The remote setting is stunning. I visited the area with my son in 2007. We saw several elk ourselves, while there. Watching this video brings back special memories of that trip.Don't miss this classic family film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney True Adventure","review":"Could you rate it a 10 or 100. Who couldn't love Disney's True Adventures. Yes, there is even a whole channel for animal adventures now, but they were the first--and they were the best. They are pack in a great package; durable and imaginative. The added interviews and backstage scenes are great. I can remember seeing them on their program (in black and white) when I was in first grade. They are wonderful. It was a treat to learn about the couple who filmed them too. Spending years and years filming things they thought was funny or interesting. Then bringing them back and someone putting them together into a story that is loved forever. I have all four of them. And we watch them over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Chance","review":"We all know about The short window for Disney DVDs. The Legacy Collection is no exception.

It is an awesome legacy. As a \\"baby boomer\\" child, I was fortunate enough to be taken to the movies to see them by my father.

Her stories depict everything from the frustration both handler and dog exhibit when there is no training and hence, no communication between the species to the amazingly strong bond that is forged with proper training and communication. Everyone who has a \\"problem\\" dog should read this book for insight. Everyone who has a \\"good\\" dog should read this book to see how much better their dog can be. And, for those few people who have the kind of relationship with their dog that Ms Woods helps her students achieve, reading this book will have you nodding your head in understanding, laughing in delight and shedding the occasional tear.

When I saw it was written by a Nobel Prize winner I thought I might be in for a pleasant suprise. It was a most unpleasant suprise and I'm not talking just about the explict sexual content. A writer is suppose to vary her sentence structure but reading Elfriede Jelinek is like listening to someone who talks on and on and on.. without pausing for breath. It's exausting. Andwho cares about Erika the repressed 38-year-old piano teacher, the lover half her age or her overbearing mother. They are dull. This novel is set in Vienna. Unfortunately it's not in the time of Sigmund Freud. Jelinek could have sent her characters right to his couch instead of inflicting their angst on her readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A vulgar and disturbing book","review":"This must be the worst book written by a Nobel Prize winning author in the history of the award.

I'm confused about why it won a nobel prize, certainly, and as an avid reader and literature major, I have read quite broadly. When I got this book I had no idea I would find it so disturbing and that it would be so sadomasochistic. I thought I should warn other readers of this.

She said that one of the functions of The Novel, as an experience that is simultaneously public and private, is to be morally subversive. The Piano Teacher is a perfect example.The protagonist is profoundly f*cked up, yet she is an extrememly clear-eyed and incisive witness to the society around her. Her inner darkness is an important part of any real, complex personality, but it is generally ignored in the stories we tell and hear.This is an amazing translation from the original German, in that much of the humor involves language play. The translator (Joachim Neugroschel) deserves recognition.This purchase was as a gift for a friend. It is one of those books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painting with words","review":"If you appreciate viciously eloquent prose, this novel is for you. The writing is both clever and creative. The story didn't quite match up the quality of the writing, but it was disturbing and tragic enough to be memorable.The piano teacher is set in Vienna during the 1980's. It is a story about a failed concert pianist who has a parasitic relationship with her mother. The combination of sexual repression and learned submissiveness cause her to go overboard and enter a destructive relationship with one of her students.Another sad and moving story about the misery that ensues when one human being tries to control another. Brilliantly mouth watering prose, deserves at least 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, stilted and melodramatic","review":"Although there are interesting issues brought up in this book, (among them, a suffocatingly intimate mother-daughter relationship) the writing is so insufferably stilted that I could barely read the book.The story centers around a piano teacher in her late thirties (often melodramatically described as \\"decaying\\" and \\"old\\") who lives with her controlling mother. She mutilates herself whenever she feels sad and lonely.A virile young student with conventional ideas of romance falls in love with the her. However, the teacher's concept of love is of the S&M; variety. The handsome student misunderstands her intentions towards him and interprets them as rejection. His wounded pride eventually leads him to beat her up and rape her, breaking her nose and rib. The teacher walks around in a short dress afterwards, carrying around a knife to mutilate herself further.This book tries too hard to be disturbing and the results are over-the-top and irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"a circle of stars...","review":"I read Sacajawea, and savored every word. but this book startedoff on the wrong foot with me.

For the most part, it is entertaining but as I get deeper into the story, suspending disbelief is becoming harder and you get the sense the book is written haphazardly. For example: Madoc, the hero, lectured the Calusa men the bad things their Chief had done to them. How could Madoc know the village's history when he just arrived that day? And Cougar, the Native American heroine, and the Welsh sailors understanding each other well after less than half a day of meeting for the very first time?

But it's hard to be humble with something this infectious rearing its ugly head above the grime and rust. The Paybacks, fuelled by the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold vocals of Wendy Case (who sounds as if she could whip Britney, Christina, and Avril in a four-woman, over-the-top-rope battle royal), turns in a brash set which alternates between sloppy and melodic and although we've heard these three chords a million times over, they never get old when delivered with such enthusiasm and swagger. In a perfect world, songs like \\"If I Fell\\" and \\"Don't Lay It On Me\\" would be leaving skidmarks all over the radio, although I'm sure the afterburn would be too much for programmers to handle.

The First 61 pages (not including the Introduction) gives the reader a breif biography of Grandmaster Sun illustrating and explaining some of his genius.

The helmet is a little large, but still stays on his head fine when the straps are tightened down. I am happy with the quality of the pads and board, but the helmet is pretty cheaply made. But for the price, the helmet is sufficient.I don't think my son will be good at skateboarding for a long time, but he likes to play with it.

He's loving it. The pads that come with it are cheap items and they probably won't last but they do get the job done. I think they will last long enough so the kid can learn to skateboard. The helmet will offer enough protection for him also. The board itself is more than good enough. I don't see any real problems with it. It rolls nicely. I gave it 5 stars for just the board. I could have knocked a star off for the cheap pads but I am focusing on the board. For the cheap price that I bought the combo pack for I knew that the cost of a good set of pads and a helmet would have easily cost more than this combo pack. This is a good deal for a first skateboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman Spiderman!!!!","review":"AMAZING!!!

My 5 year old son got on my longboard and did awsome so I decided he should have his own. I also wanted him to have wristgaurds and elbow and kneepads. After reading the reviews I decided that this was a good bargain. The pads and wristgaurd are fine however the helmet is way to big for a child. It fits me so at the risk of looking silly maybe I'll use it. The board looks nice but the trucks are plastic and the wheels didn't spin to well. I loosened the nuts and sprayed some lubricant and they spin much better. However the board does not move under the wieght of a grown up.

Grassroots is one of those albums you can listen to ALL THE WAY THROUGH, and love every minute of it. Like Pearl Jam's Ten for instance. All the songs are classic, especially the concert fave Homebrew and my personal favorite, 8:16 A.M., and illustrate what makes 311 a standout in the \\"rock/rap/reggae fusion\\" genre. 311 is a tight group with a real talent for songwriting and Grassroots is their finest effort.

Or just gauge my weight by how I fit in my clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I'm finally fed up with this scale for good because I am on a diet for the first time in my life after having a baby and really need to have accurate results. This scale can literally give you results 5 or more pounds off within minutes and NOT moving the scale at all. It often errors too, with a big ERR on the screen. I would definitely not recommend this one to someone who needs to track their weight loss. I'm getting ready to buy the Lifesource Precision as that one seemed to get top reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"scales","review":"This scale is much too small for anyone with a foot size over a 7 to use.

A truly great author presents the information and allows the reader to draw their own conclusions. Not only does \\"High Tide\\" NOT allow us to draw our own conclusions, but it lacks the fresh prose of \\"The Poisonwood Bible.\\" Thumbs down to a potentially great author who is biased, mis-informed, and forceful in her personal beliefs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compilation of life experiences and the resulting beleifs.","review":"High Tide in Tuscon was a very slow reading book that did not appeal to me. The various thoughts included by the author were food for thought but did not compensate for the boring text in the book. Barbara Kingsolver used so many adjectives in her descriptions it seemed as if she was trying to confuse the reader instead of creating an image."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum!","review":"I'm glad I didn't waste any money on this dreary litany of what an eternal adolescent doesn't like about the world. However, I do concede that some people who grew up after 1970 would think these ideas original. There are better (and more honest) memoirs of warriors who fight to make the world better without descending into self-pity. As for \\"style\\"--where is a good editor when you really need one?"},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Write...","review":"I recently read this wonderful book of essays by Barbara Kingsolver. When a person loves to write, it shows. If I was to teach a class on writing (I don't), I'd include books where the shere joy of writing is present: Kingsolver has that.And she is humble too. Her success seems to surprise her when she writes about being pregnant and, having nothing else to do, scribbles out a novel that is published. Her joy expressed at being published is evident. And infectious.Find your own voice; that is what Kingsolver does. That is what writers strive to do. That is what is so wonderfully evident in this beautifully written book of essays. It's all there: the pain of divorce, the beauty of nature, the wonders of the mundane, the trials of empire.I'm a fan of this author. I read very few novels; hers I enjoy. I loved her book on eating locally for a year. I love her love of nature. Kingsolver is a treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"This book was given to me by my undergraduate thesis professor before I started graduate school. I had never heard of Barbara Kingsolver before but we are eerily alike. We both are from Kentucky and moved to Tucson to pursue graduate studies in biology. I thought my professor gave this book to me because of our similarities but after reading through the essays I realize Kingsolver writes from her past. She pulls many of her themes from this scientific background although it's not a scientific read at all. She's a compelling wordsmith and presents fairly novel ideas. It is definitely suiting for a young person moving away to start their career.I highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great background to the novels","review":"Barbara Kingsolver's book of essays, High Tide in Tucson, is an interesting and enjoyable read. Fans of Kingsolver's books will recognize many aspects of Kingsolver's life as described in the essays, from her novels. While her novels are not autobiographical, it is gratifying to know that some elements of her wonderful novels are derived from first-hand knowledge and experience. The title essay, about a hermit crab, is especially delightful and interesting. I recommend this book to fans of Kingsolver's novels as an excellent background read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and occasionally hilarious","review":"This collection of Kingsolver's essays makes thought-provoking and occasionally hilarious reading. Be warned: if you don't share her values, you probably won't enjoy it because unlike her fiction it doesn't cloak those values in story. Yet even then you may find it interesting, because you'll learn a lot about how Kingsolver writes. From conceiving her characters and building their worlds (something literary novelists must do just as surely as must sci-fi writers), to marketing the books after publication, she takes the reader of these essays on a lively journey through her own version of the writing life. Recommended, although not as highly as her novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasurable introduction to Barbara Kingsolver","review":"I thought it was an appropriate book to bring along with me to southern Arizona. When I started reading it while camping at Chiricahua National Monument, I was immediately transfixed. I finished it after returning to Boston, when the appeal of the book got even better. It is for anyone who loves nature and has a whole lot of respect for it; she also shares with her readers unique views of special, relatively unknown places such as Canary islands, Benin, a Nature Conservancy preserve in Kentucky, Haleakala Crater, and a remote place somewhere in the southwestern fringe of Arizona (Cabeza Prieta wildlife refuge or Kofa Wilderness perhaps?). What a great experience to be transported to these places by the power of her words, her keen perceptiveness, and her insatiable curiosity. I am definitely bound to read more of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book about things we've always looked at but never seen","review":"As I read this book, I found myself agreeing with the author about so many things I've thought but never put into words. From tongue-in-cheek humor about childhood dreams of motorcycle gangs and ongoing battles with local wild pig populations to philosophical ruminations on our place in the universe and high tide in a desert, this book delighted me and touched me. A series of short essays, it's a book that can be sipped or gulped, according to personal preference. I'm going to buy it for my mother and my best friend. What better recommendation can I give"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a huge Barbara Kingsolver fan and have read all of her other books. But I just couldn't get past even the first essay in the book. I am sure it is just a different style of writing--essay versus novel. People who usually like essays may like it. But to me it was just a lot of prattling about nothing in particular. Give me a plot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreshing read.","review":"A delightful collection of essays. After reading heavy and verbose novels of \\"thundering\\" dinosaurs and burned war participants, it is refreshing to read essays again. Kingsolver is a wonderful storyteller whether it's fiction or real life.This collection is a must read for anyone relocated from their roots and family, or anyone looking for insight into their own lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"The X factor","review":"You can't help but make comparisons to X, and that's the problem.

Can't wait to hear it with more expensive speakers and higher quality speaker wires. If you are the type that likes to jump right in without reading the owners manual, at least read page 14 before you try listening to in. That would have saved me some time.

Once upon a time, 311 was a pretty good band. Now they are just pathetic. They deserve a score less than one star. The fan base of 311 has fallen to the level of frat boys and 13 year old girls. Hope they can sleep at night knowing that their skater punk, X-treme games audience is growing up fast. If any of the members of 311 happen to read this review, I would offer a piece of advice.

But non-MTV watchers (like myslef) can listen to this CD over and over again. The opener \\"Down\\" is one of the greatest 311 songs ever. Some of the other highlights are \\"Random\\", \\"Hive\\", \\"Guns (Are for ......)\\", \\"Misdirected Hostility\\", and of course the best song on the CD in my opinion, \\"Don't Stay Home\\".

These guys do indeed have talent I will admit that but the cheesiness of the lyrics in their songs just completly bring down the credibilty of the band.

The perfect blends of hardrock and rap. And who doesn't love the reggae, punk, rap sounds comin from \\"All Mixed Up\\"? The only thing they lacked was SA's use of the turntable.

The Federal Reserve has been called the most powerful institution in America, but relatively few modern Americans have any inkling of how it operates or makes policy decisions.

What should have been a tribute (I love Sondheim, but do we need ANOTHER anthology recording of oft sung songs?)is more like a wake. Mandy seems intent on becoming the male Ethel Merman -- if you can't hold the note, belt it out with a misplaced vabrato and maybe no one will notice.

Your voicemail does not tell you date and time of messages, and erases even saved messages after a couple of days, text and voicemail. Sometimes I like to save voicemails for longer than that.

Firstly, the battery life isn't very good. I have to charge it every other day. I keep it on all the time, but don't talk on it alot. But the more serious complaint is that is occasionally just turns off on me (when battery isn't low on life). And it occasionally just ends calls - doesn't turn off, but drops the call, and this is when it shows good coverage. I will probably have to either return it or get warranty replacement or something.

Received great service and item was in excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"I love Amanda Quick books. She never lets me down. The mystery, adventure, and romance is great. This story follows much of the same path of her other books in that the young lady is an innocent girl who has more brains and spine than most women of her day. She meets up with a strong man who is determined to have her while joining her in solving a mystery. There is always someone trying to kill them.What do you get with this book? Adventure, a couple of hot scenes between the couple, a mystery, and a book you can't put down.If you like historical romances, Amanda Quick books are for you. This one was a pleasure to read. I won't sum up the plot as it can be found right here on Amazon.com.All I can say is that it is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring!","review":"I love a good formulaic read, but this one is too boring! The characters spend most of the book congratulating one another on how very clever they both are whilst the reader yawns and wishes they would prove it rather than say it. There are a few clever lines, but for my money I would go with Amanda Quick's Ravished, which has very similar, but far more interesting and dynamic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"This was the first Amanda Quick I have read and I came to it with high expectations. She has a lot of fans but I'm certainly not one of them! 'Dangerous' was one of those irritating historical romances that is set in a period, and then no further reference is made to the times. The historical accuracy was appalling. Worse than this however was the complete lack of depth of characterisation, and totally unbelievable sensationalist plot. I must admit to liking more quality in my novels than Quick provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"unimpressive...","review":"I was...beyond unimpressed by this book. It was so BLAND. So we have a heroine that...barges in at 3am, makes random demands for the hero to apologize, because her own brother won't...and then, sorta sits back and twiddles her thumbs for the rest of the book...She would be tossed out of any debate tournament for repitition, and lack of structure, as well as slightly faulty logic-- \\"yes, so, my brother challenged YOU to a duel, but, um, it's still your fault, and you have to apologize--even though you gain absolutely nothing from it\\"huh?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad and Boring!!!!","review":"This book of Amanda Quick was soo boring. The hero's family kept on insulting the heroine but she never fought back. All she did was listen and listen!!!! I'm a women and if somebody insulted me in such ways i would surely go crazy!!!!But our Charming and utterly stupid heroine just stud there and never fought back. Miss Quick has never done such a poor job and i'm totally chargained by her bad work!!! I'm still a big fan of Miss Quick but i request please don't write such type of novels in the future. It pains me to read about how badly women were treated and people actually write about the heroines being treated that way!!! I hope i dont read this kind of story setting in the future!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I got this and immediately returned it. I didn't realize from the web description that it is made out of plastic and gives a cheap, chrome-like appearance. Because of the way it is made, the skulls come off as gaudy--but that's just me. I can see this mirror in one of those monster trucks--you know, the kind you have to use a step ladder to get into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This product was great!

Awesome price from Amazon vendors as well.

Bo & Luke, the main stars of the show are back for good(after they left last season). Season 6 of Dukes has some really good episodes, \\"Too many Roscos\\" just to name one. I highly recommend this season to any Dukes fan. One more season after this to be released!!! YAY!!! PLEASE WARNER BROS can you also release the 2 reunion movies, The Dukes of Hazzard cartoon & Enos TV show on DVD? that would be great as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season Six -Better stories, but seen better days","review":"After the shake up of the previous season,The Dukes of Hazzard sixth season is a welcome turning point within the series.Unfortunately many were chased off by the previous years changes.The biggest improvement were the edgier storylines.The \\"Let's Frame The Dukes\\" plots still were the norm, but episodes like \\"Enos Last Chance\\" and \\"The Dukes Undercover\\" showed a maturity within the shows direction (thanks to Tom Wopat and John Schnider's complaints towards weak scripts).Unfortunately by 1983, shows like The A-Team and Knight Rider stole the Dukes thunder along with the aforementioned Season 5 shakeup.The penultimate season six is worth a look at an underrated chapter of this beloved show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yea for the Dukes!","review":"What else is there to say?

That is soooo fun! Then James Best gets to show his range in \\"Too Many Roscos,\\" and the various Roscos are shuffled around so much you barely know which one is which. His daughter Janeen shows up as Mary Lou in \\"A Baby for the Dukes.\\" Boss and Rosco do a drag-thang in \\"Targets: Daisy and Lulu.\\" And holy cow -- we get to meet Cooter's daughter! Cooter shows his true colors all through the series, but in this one he really shines. The lovely Lydia Cornell of \\"Too Close for Comfort\\" guest-stars in the two-parter \\"Undercover Dukes.\\" Luke's baby brother Jud Kane and his former flame Candy Dix also show up this season. Rapidly regaining momentum after reinstating its two main stars, \\"The Dukes\\" rolled in top form in Season 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeeeeeeee Haw!!!","review":"Season 6 is the first full season with Bo and Luke after they returned to the show. The entire original cast is here, including Enos who returned in the 5th season. Lulu also stars in more episodes during this season. Some very memorable episodes aired this season, including \\"Targets: Daisy and Lulu\\", \\"Undercover Dukes\\" and \\"Cooters Confession\\". Look for the General Lee's jumps to appear higher and more unrealistic at times. This is because around this time Warner Brothers started to use minatures to film some of the jump scenes. This was one of the better seasons they filmed, right behind the first two seasons which are the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!

Like that user, I have misgivings about both of these add-ons to Windows, and won't install them on my machine. As a result, I can't use this pen.Too bad. It sounds like a useful tool for my work, but it's not worth the security exposure that it comes with."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT DOESN'T WORK","review":"It's no use whatsoever to claim how wonderful this product is and how clever it is to have a pen that \\"remembers\\" what it writes, when the damned thing DOES NOT WORK.I'd installed the NET framework necessary, followed all the directions in order (including trying to \\"train\\" the pen to recognise my handwriting), and even re-installed the software several times.It DOES NOT WORK.Oh, the pen vibrates and blinks different colours, in the order it's supposed to, as IF it were working, but it does not DOWNLOAD anything.I'd even double-checked that the drivers were loaded, re-set the pen (then did a hard re-set), etc., and all in the right order.

It doesn't work.What's the use of having an interesting concept for a product and interesting looking product, when IT DOESN'T WORK?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech io Pen","review":"The idea seems good but for my general application I found it overkill and too much to use, in fact I didn't pursue it beyond initial partial installation -- I'm assuming that it works. Note that you have to use special paper which I would assume costs quite a bit. Alternatively I plan to merely scan a plain sheet of paper with writing or drawings and save it as a .jpg document using multiple indexing available in the Windows photo manager. If I want to extract a portion of a page I can use a picture editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, Horrible Product","review":"I purchased the Logitech io Personal Digital Pen from Amazon.com on Dec 5th. I received the package on Dec 11th. I found the pen to be over sized and hard to write with, but decided to give it a try anyway. Upon completion of the calibration task, I set out to put my pen to use. The ICR (Image Character Recognition) software did not recognize any lower cased letter and rarely recognized my capitol letters. I continued to try calibrating the pen, but was never successful. The idea of this product was wonderful, but the delivery fell far short of mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"What IS it????","review":"I thought the IO was a handwriting recognition device that would save me from banging the keyboard. No such luck. According to the reviews I should have read before purchasing it, it simply makes pictures of what you write.Anyway, I tried to install it and after receiving numerous error messages contacted the company. Their recommendation would have involved going deep into the system to make changes on something I hardly can understand. (I started to do so and ended up with my XP interface changing partially to a WIN 2000 interface --for shutting down) Maybe I'll put it up for auction on the Web. I guess I'll go back to voice recognition."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT fully compatible w/XP-SP1 and no support from OEM","review":"After many attempts with OEM installs of hardware, OS, and Logitech software, our company abandoned this product evaluation.We spent 4wks trying to get our \\"Premium level\\" support help to solve the problem (installshield error with XPSP1) without more than a few emails from Logitech saying 'Install the Microsoft client'.If you want to run it on W98 or W2K it's a nice product. OCR only works for title of page or email address to send the notes. The pen documents are essentially pictures in the pen format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Logitech \\"Beta\\" Io Digital Pen","review":"It took less than an hour for me to decide that Logitech has a way to go before releasing this as anything than a beta. The ICR function, even after training 4x's more than suggested, still mixed up all of my vowels. The restricted spaces you must write in are far to small to use quickly. It never did interface with any of my office programs. When I asked it to create a to do or a calander entry it pretty much ignored me. When trying to contact support, the auto return said they get back to me in two business days.For almost two hundred dollars, and the need to write only on a certain type of paper, makes this product undesirable for our needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product but the vendor provides excellent customer service.","review":"I write A LOT and was hoping to use this pen to free up paperwork. The moment i received it, it failed to work and I notified the vendor ASAP! The vendor was sorry for the inconvenience and promptly provided a refund and told me to discard the unit. I appreciated his prompt, courteous service but would not recommend this pen to anyone unless it came with the supporting software and special notebook needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Talented","review":"It'll be a while until you hear another group with this much talent...

The music and playing are especially tight, with great ensemble playing throughout. My only problem here is the rather vague lyrics that show up here and there - I feel like they could've done better somehow. This shouldn't detract from the excellence of such tracks like \\"Hold on to Midnight\\" and \\"Waitress\\". Fans of straight up rock (especially roots rock) will probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rocker Board","review":"The rocker board arrived on time and in good condition.

I wish that verizon would check on this as I left messages with the manufacturer but received no cd and no response. I bought it over a month ago.

My complaints are: until the holster has been used for a week or two the amount of force needed to draw it are in my opinion too excessive. After the intial \\"breaking in\\" period the draw becomes much smoother. My other complaint is a rather marginalized one; if you are over-weight (like me) and have anything hanging over your belt line then the gun will dig into your side every time you sit down. Also, if you're wanting this for a concealed carry holster you will probably need to buy a coat that is longer than the norm.

It has the charisma of films like the Great Race, Chitty Bang Bang, and Speed Racer. In a historical setting with actors such as Tony Curtis,Terry Thomas and Gert Frobe, it gives you the international flavor of the old road rallies of the past. You even get a glimpse of the comedy teamwork of Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. So if road races are your thing, you need to get this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I enjoyed the Great Race. I did not like this movie. I bought it based on another persons review. Don't make the same mistake. Tony Curtis in this movie is terrible. The story is terrible and the filming of it is terrible.

A must have for any costumer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Debut, But A Tease","review":"This was one of the most impressive releases I had heard in a long time when it first came out. Although it's generally lumped into the blues-rock category, it has elements of soul & even gospel that give it a very unique sound. Moore shows off some of the best vocals here that I've ever heard, & his songwriting is thoughtful, personal & sometimes spiritual. I was anxious to see what the future would hold for this promising artist. Unfortunately, after a followup live EP which mainly included selections from this release, Moore has since opted for an eclectic experimental approach with disappointing results."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Inside Scoop","review":"This book is the closest thing to actually being there whilethe film was made. Parisi's exclusive access to the set and Cameronpermits an over the shoulder view describing details and nuances that went into making a movie of epic proportions. Many facets of directing are not generally known and we are made aware of the struggle and persistence to get things done. Thus we have insight into the genius of Cameron and respect for the author's ability to translate the enormity of making this masterpiece. I enjoyed being a fly on the wall thanks to Parisi's book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very technical","review":"I'll buy anything to do with the Titanic, especially books, but I was really disappointed with this book. It's very technical, and not only takes into what happens during planning/filming Titanic, but goes into detail about the three years before it even begun filming. There's a lot of stuff about James Cameron's \\"Abyss\\", and there's really more detail than needed.It's a long hard slog to get through this book, and I wouldn't recommend it for Titanic fans out there. I'd recommend it to people who are interested in Titanic AND who are interested in the film making business. You could learn a lot from James Cameron."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing love story with a realsitic view of titanic.","review":"This movie is simply heartwrenching. Everytime I see it (3 times) I cry, shiver, and feel so deeply moved by this movie. No other movie has touched my heart and my soul like Titanic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a historical work...","review":"I read this book and I must say I was very dissapointed. As a autobiography of James Cameron and his movie, the book does a good job.But as for Perisi's Titanic information, she has made numerous errors. She gets alot of key dates in Titanic's story completely wrong. She has a good grasp of her subject matter, James Cameron, and she takes you inside the world of making movies which I found facinating. But, as far as the historical aspect of the book namely Titanic herself, Ms. Perisi equally demonstrates her lack of knowledge and research into Titanic's history.She could have read the book that everyone else on Cameron's Titanic set read \\"Titanic: An Illustrated History by Lynch & Marschall\\" before writing her account. She at least would have had an accurate Titanic timeline and a better grasp of Titanic's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of biased and not historically correct","review":"If you are looking for a book on the movie Titanic that includes quotes from the stars, this is not the book for you. The author rarely quoted Leo and Kate and even put in some criticizing facts, like Leo playing video games everyday and Kate calling in sick everyday. While these may be true, she seemed biased because she turned around to praise Cameron. At times it seemed more like Cameron's biography than a book on his movie.This author is also not an expert on Titanic. What little historical information that is included is wrong. For example, she says the Titanic hit the iceberg at 10:30 pm and sank in 2 hours and 40 minutes, at 2:20 am. It should be that the Titanic hit the iceberg at 11:40 pm and sank at 2:20 am. If she had done her research on the event as well as the movie and it's making, she would have known that.This book is okay. I would not recommend buying it because I have read better books on the making of this great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"I found this book very good.

The book itself is very easy to understand--simple-minded, even, in its handling of the material--yet it leaves no lasting impact on me. Far more vivid for me, as far as getting a sense of how Cameron looks at things and what \\"Titanic\\" meant for him, was \\"James Cameron's Titanic.\\" That's the book to read if you want to get a feel for Cameron's emotional and working relationship to the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to get some wine bottles in and out","review":"It seems to function largely as I expected it to, except for two things:1. I had to conduct an experiment with a thermometer to figure out whether the \\"Min\\" and \\"Max\\" on the dial meant \\"maximum cooling\\" or \\"maximum temperature\\". I think Min is the warmest, and Max is the coldest.2. Wine bottles vary in thickness a bit. (For example, a typical Pinot Noir bottle is a little wider than a typical Cabernet Sauvignon bottle.) The spaces for wine bottles are a bit small for getting the wider ones in and out, and I probably couldn't fit a bunch of the wider ones near each other.

This is especially rare when a film is adapted to a musical format. \\"Dolly\\" seemed to follow the script of \\"Matchmaker\\" very closely, but did a much better job of putting it across. It added umph where it belonged, really bringing out the many choice morsels of the story. \\"Matchmaker\\" seems stagy by comparison and actually a rather mechanical run-through. I know its actors are veterans and some from the same vehicle on stage, but they lack the edge in this movie presentation of the fresher and sharper \\"Dolly\\" cast. The material begged for the snap that \\"Dolly\\" gave it. \\"Matchmaker\\" is a good enough movie, but \\"Dolly\\" really sings (even when there's no music)."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NON MUSICAL DOLLY!","review":"This has a great cast.

After repeated listenings, I really started to get into it. Every song is very catchy, and the disc definately grows on you. John McCrea's bitter vocals are wry and incisive as always, and the bass lines are driving, the trumpets are soaring, the guitar breaks are rocking, and the drums are banging. John's vocals and the music really mesh together well, rendering a furor of rich, melodic, pop songs. The apex of the cd is probably the funky jamming toward the end of track 5, Tolene. Backround vocalists are chanting an amazing \\"ahhhh ah ahhh\\" in the backround while the guitar solo is just shredding and John is begging the listener to \\"get down!\\" Awesome. Other high points include the opener Comanche, Rock N Roll Lifestyle, Ain't No Good and I Bombed Korea. This cd is intelligent pop/rock at its best. Any fans of cake or just pop music in general should be smitten with this incredible outing from a stellar band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arguably the strongest Cake album","review":"The other two (Fashion Nugget & Prolonging the Magic) rock, but this one is the most consistent, hardly ever (if ever) missing a beat while Fashion Nugget, for example, have two covers and a song not written by any members of the band; none of which are bad, just kind of like throwaways. Prolonging the Magic has no bad songs, either, but some of the songs don't have quite the same impact as others. MOG has no throwaways or anything coming close to resembling one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had no idea...","review":"I first bought Prolonging the Magic, then Fashion Nugget, and was disappointed when \\"Rock and Roll Lifestyle\\" wasn't on there. So, I found out what album it was on... lo and behold, there's an album even before Fashion Nugget! I downloaded, then bought Motorcade of Generosity, and love it! It seems to go more in sync with Prolonging the Magic in Cake consistency. The sound is much different, but it seems more polished, as PTM does, and FN doesn't. There are early country undertones in many of the songs, but they have a very distinct rock 'n roll sound. I would recommend buying this album either first or last. To talk about Cake, or just music in general, or ANYTHING AT ALL, for AIM: Impermanent Rat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asleep at the switch . .","review":"I love this band, but who produced this record? It's not low-fi - it's zero-fi.

Their new album that just came out, Showroom of Compassion, is awesome and it feels like they're going back to what made them so much fun to listen to in the first place.

The (barely) plausible plot is constantly buried under the authors ceaseless need to explain every act and conversation with a mind-boggling preface. It's as if the narrator/captain puts on his Socrates hat and weighs the very essence and meaning of life for perhaps a full page before allowing himself to say: \\"Right full rudder.\\" About two thirds of the way through the book, the author finds he hasn't described a sex scene yet, so lets loose with a stunningly bad attempt to name all the girl parts, then the 'thrusting, throbbing, etc.' begins like a parody of a Penthouse Forum letter. And the ending came so weird and confusing, I was surprised only that it didn't surprise me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very unsatisfying read","review":"My complaints about this book mirror what all the other negative reviews have hit upon. I could live with all those flaws if there weren't some other fatal flaws that I can't get past: 1) Why are all land masses covered with a black fog? This is unheard of as far as I know. 2) What about the French radio operator and the supposed explanation for how the war started? 3) You have a scenario that has the surviving crew living happily and peacefully on this island, yet some crew members go out all willy-nilly and create nuclear Armageddon all over again without any explanation save a couple of sentences of speculation? You gotta be kidding me. If someone has an explanation for all this, I'd love to hear it. 4) The love of his life has blown herself up in that little stunt, yet he doesn't spend a minute reflecting on the loss. What the heck?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Say \\"No\\" to Brinkley","review":"Never mind the laborious writing style - William Brinkley tries to write a clever apocalyptic thriller and does a pretty shoddy job of it. His \\"nautical\\" narration and dialogue are rife with laughable anachronisms and a cursory understanding of modern naval warfare and how a warship operates at sea, while trying desperately to sound authentic. Similarly, Brinkley apparently never stopped to think that breeding generations of people who by design have no idea who their fathers are will ultimately repopulate the planet with inbred mutants as successive generations unwittingly procreate with their own siblings (again, perhaps a Naval officer in reality wouldn't know such things, but Brinkley tries to feed it to the reader as a brilliant device to save mankind while maintaining the peace on the island). Read \\"On the Beach\\" instead.."},{"rating":"1","title":"verbose, pretentious and outright silly","review":"I ordered this book because other Amazon.com readers thought highly of it. It was dreadful. When I waded through the verbiage, I found a potentially interesting story marred by scientific implausibility and simplistic characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I read the whole thing","review":"Having spent four years in the navy (cruiser and carrier Navy), had a father who worked in Civil Defense, and having enjoyed \\"On the Beach\\", \\"The Postman\\", \\"Alas Babylon\\" and almost everything written by Tom \\"Pre-Hollywood\\" Clancy, I was appalled that this book with it's inaccuracies and drollery ever made it to press.Echoing what an earlier reviewer said regarding the style, it seemed to come out of a \\"Writing The Great American Novel\\" College Course. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is thin to the point of invisibility and the dialogue, when present is stilted and agonizingly Ayn Randish.This book doesn't reflect my experiences in the Co-ed Navy, nor does it bear out any explanation as to why the EMP effected everyone on Earth, save the Nathan James, or why the radiation contaminated every place except this small island.To borrow a phrase from the 1980's Pepto-Bismol commercial, \\"I Can't Believe I Read The Whole Thing.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss This \\"Last Ship\\"","review":"I was so glad I got this book out of the library; I hate to waste money. After the first 4 chapters of long-winded prose and very little substance, I was able to chuck it aside without a qualm. You want good post-apocalyptic fiction? Go re-read A Canticle for Liebowitz or Lucifer's Hammer. Don't bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book -- poorly written, 'random' plot","review":"An awful, awful book. Brinkley is evidently under the impression that the longer his sentences and the more adjectives he packs into them, the better the writing is. He's wrong. The style is convoluted, murky, and a chore to get through. (A reading of _The Elements of Style_ is in order for Brinkley.)The plot, which is admittedly a good one, suffers not only from poor writing, but from a series of seemingly random events (I won't give spoilers) thrown in simply to add twists and make the characters suffer. There's also a fair amount of silliness -- a nuclear winter that lasts a few weeks? Please.Don't bother. There are far, far better end-of-the-world books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This story really keeps you reading and wanting to get to the next page cause you can't wait to see what happens. For me, it was a story that really could happen. I was able to put myself in the story and live with the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't Finish -- No Rating","review":"There is something about this story that caused me to stop reading about half-way through. It is very well written, up to that point, and the character whose viewpoint we share is intelligent and interesting, but I kept getting negative vibes to such a degree that I shut down, and put the book aside. This is something I do every now and then with certain books; it has nothing to do with the level of violence, or anything of that sort (there is no violence in the story, so far as I've read), but with some underlying aura that turns me off. So I can't recommend the book, though it may be perfectly alright for many people.No rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end?!","review":"I have owned the hard cover version of this book for over ten years. I think I got it from a book club. About every year or so--in between Clancy, DeMille, and W.E.B. Griffin--I pick it up again and try to read it. I still have not made it all the way through. Simply put, the writing style is just plain painful! This is the last time. Going to give it way after this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly unreadable","review":"I had such great hopes for this book and it was just an incredible disappointment. This author simply has no business writing novels. Some people simply have no aptitude for certain professions and----knowing this----they overcompensate by trying too hard and it definitely shows in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story, Great Plot","review":"I enjoyed the concept of the story, and the overall plot. I must admit that at times the story did move slowly; and that the author's reluctance to use periods caused sentences to grow to the size of paragraphs. Being a former Navy veteran myself, I can appreciate that Mr. Brinkley wanted his main character to portray \\"Navy Life\\" in the telling of his ship's tale. While some of the military technicalities were exaggerated, along with some of the characters how the situations that occurred....this is a work of fiction about a doomsday type event, give the guy a break. I liked the book, and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of the military genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"S L O W","review":"I kept looking at the first publish date, this novel went along at such a slow pace and with such long, drawnout explainations for much of book, it felt like something from a completely begone age. This took all the fun from the book. What should have been an exciting novel of a brash new world, turns into a slow-paced, pulling your feet out of deep mud at every step kind of torment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting; a book that makes you think.","review":"By pure chance I picked up this book, read the back and figured it would be a good read...I wasn't ready for the effect it had on me. I couldn't put it down, and on the rare occasions I did, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The disturbingly eerie descriptions of nuclear winter (there is a crazy scene where there is black snow falling at the equator) and the sheer loneliness and isolation the crew faces kept me into the book from start to finish. Brinkley does get a little wordy with his narrator-captain, but it only is to demonstrate the introspectiveness of that character and the sheer responsibility that he faces for the survival of his crew and ultimately, the human race."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"This book is a 616 page 1.4 pound sleeping pill. I kept nodding off throughout the duration of reading due to the maddeningly detailed and metaphorical ways the captain of the USS Nathan James used to describe everything including people around him without ever getting to some sort of point or conclusion of what he's talking about. As for the nuclear exchange you don't find out who started it or why, not that it really matters I suppose but it would have provided the book with an interesting aspect which would have made reading not so sleep inducing.So there you have it, the book The Last Ship and if you're a suffer of chronic insomnia then this book is just the thing to cure you, plus with every single word that was ever found in a Dictionary and Thesaurus used in this book it'll help boost you're vocabulary, so it is actually quite beneficial."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great lesson in leadership","review":"I have read this book twice and am considering a third read. True, I did find the prose terribly expansive, but beyond that the plot in situational considerations makes it fascinating. I especially find the captain's thoughts regarding the transition from a monarchy (while they're at sea) to a democracy (once they settle on the island) to be fascinating. I recommend this book to future leaders in my company as an example of how to really build consensus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper it's written on...","review":"I have read no other book by this author and for that I'm glad. Only one time in my entire life of 50 years and about 8,500 books have I ever given up on a book and this is it. As a sailor I could not believe that some think his descriptions are accurate. The one most egregiously stupid part is when the Captain is wondering how he is going to convince the men and women under his command that they may be the seeds of new human race. He is wondering how he can convince them to have sex (procreate). LOLLLLLLLL. If the price for this book hits 5o cents, save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Reading of this author","review":"I have been doing talking books, I was very impressed at my willingness to drag myself through this book. Writing is very convoluted and pompous. I think a 50% volume reduction would have been about right. As far as plot, it was fairly believable from a psychological point of view, but the characters were thin and not bright (eg. how many women do you let disappear before you investigate ?) I found the ending abrupt and unpleasant. I don't require happy endings, but this was just stupid. I can't believe that anyone would want a sequel. Well, only me to blame for finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Well the only way to know what the book is about is to read the back cover. I have gotten 169 pages into the book and the story has made no mention as to why the ship has so little fuel and why they are on an island trying to catch fish and plant a garden.The book is mostly the captin talking to himself and very little of talking with the crew...

The worst book I ever bought.I am giving it to the local public library, if they will take it.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wha hoppa?","review":"Read this during one of my EOTW phases (also read Earth Abides, Alas Babylon, A Canticle for Leibowitz, Lucifer's Hammer, etc.). I have to say that it was a something of a chore to get through. Probably worth a read if you're into End of the World...HOWEVER, I still don't really understand the ending of this book (thus my review title).

Email me at [...] (Simpson's reference)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piss poor book","review":"I only give this book one star though I wish I could have rated it as a negative star! This book with its turgid and slow writing was not unfortunately, the worst end of the world book I've read, but it rates very high on that chart. The book was boring and the sub plots, if not silly, did nothing to enhance the story. A post nuclear war novel set against the survivers of on a Navy destroyer and the struggle to come to grips with this new world. It is of course a modern ship complete with suitable quota of women. The author seems to know his tech and the Fleet but thats where it ends...Techno babble cannot carry a story this bad tho the idea was interesting enough to attract my attention and my misspent dollars...Stay away, even at a dollar or less, it is not worth it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad waste of a major talent","review":"By far the worst book ever published by Brinkley - a waste of paper and braincells. I was so disappointed after reading this that I am lead to wonder if there was not a ghost writer involved. There was none of the vivid characterization that fills his other works - It was loaded with the latest eco freak and pacificist buzz words.truly a tragedy that a great talent could sink so low."},{"rating":"1","title":"These are sailors, not Shakespeareans....","review":"What I did like about Brinkley's \\"The Last Ship\\", is his worship and veneration of women. The 'climactic' love scene in the book is one of the most poetic and sensual I have ever read--a beautiful picture of the joys of a woman...but....sailors on American missile destroyers do not speak with the forced Shakespearean elocution that Brinkley portrays in the book. This unrealistic narrative, and his frequent philosophical musings made me wonder where his editor was. The story and imagery were good, if you did not miss it while skipping over the profundities and absurd dialogs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wholeheartedly recomend this book","review":"I read this book first when I was in Sixth Grade (back during the 80s) and it scared the bejeezus out of me.

A very under-rated book. I located Brinkley in TX by phone within a yr or two of the book coming out. I asked him about a sequel and he was non-committal. Sadly, I believe he is dead, so there will be no sequel unless someone else picks up the thread. I'd love to see what else this guy wrote. I had never heard of him before and this book just blew me away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very wordy and intricate examination of one man's soul","review":"The premise of this book is most interesting and presents ample opportunity for examination of issues most will never confront but many consider. Unfortunately the author contents himself with the microscopic examinaion of the motivations behind each and every word or shoulder shrug of every character in the book. I must confess to finally putting this book in the \\"later when it's raining\\" pile after nearly 275 pages. By that point, I found it more work than it was worth to find out how it ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style reminds me of Melville...","review":"Totally convoluted. I found myself skipping quickly through paragraphs of prose. Unlike some, I found the dialog and interaction between the characters the high point.As far as the plot goes, very interesting. A new take on a theme I darkly enjoy. However, many of the plot elements were not very plausible. Warning: Spoilers follow...You can't refuel a reactor at sea. Even if the Nathan Hale was built to be easily refuled, you just can't do it yourself. The outcoming rods would be very hot, for one. Two, the Russian rods would not be of compatible size or type.I don't think radiation would spread to all land masses as completely and quickly as the author supposes - especially in a limited exchange.The safest place for the missles is inside the ship and sub. If they were worried, they could have thrown the keys overboard. Salt water would eventually corrode the warheads and pollute the sea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, but...","review":"Yes , there is a lot of \\"big words\\"yes, you do have to seriously suspend your disbeliefyes, there is some interesting subtext about women in the navyyes, there are parts that do seem to rambleyes, \\"on the beach\\" in many ways is betteryes, the end is a bit abruptBUT- This is still a very good read. The idea is compelling, and although the narrator has his flaws, you really start to emphasis with the him. The dilemma he has is still pretty unique, and really is incomparable to much other fiction. In short, if you like apocolyptic fiction, and dont mind some serious long sentences, and like books that make you ask \\"What would I do? I wouldn't do that!\\" Then you will like this one. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meandering and Overwritten","review":"I wish I could give this book a better recommendation. It seemed like it would be a classic end-of-the-world epic like On The Beach. The problem is it's about 250 pages too long. There just isn't that much happening. They go here. They go there. At times, The Last Ship is a great character study. Some of the scenes are powerful and frightening. In other places there is page after page after page after page of dense, overwritten narrative. Eventually I began to scan through these blocks of droning text just to see what happened in the end.Brinkley also has a strange grasp of syntax. His writing can be confusing as heck. Often his sentences, like clouds, when I was boy, back East, where my parents owned our first home, which was a two story Victorian, are bent inside out with bewildering asides or backasswards placement of his nouns. A dozen times, I had to stop and trace my way through again just to understand what he was talking about.Two and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Neville Shute","review":"Brinkley labors to fully charecterize even the most peripherial figures in this novel. I was reminded of a creative writing class in which the assignment is to write 1000 words of description without any action. This excessive, often tedious \\"adjectivitis\\" has expanded what should have been a short story to over 500 pages. Additionally, the pictures of the crew that Brinkley paints are one dimensional and unbelievable: all the people on the ship seem to have been among the world's elite in every pre-navy activity, whether it was as a gymnast, jesuit, or ballerina. The random, unexplained plot \\"twist\\" at the end may have been Brinkley's attempt to capture a kind of hopeless angst; the meaninglessness of the denoument left this reader annoyed, particularly after having slogged through the aforementioned hyper description. I recommened that readers who seek a novel that reflects cold-war cultural anxiety choose Neville Shute's \\"On the Beach\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"500 Pages of Nothing","review":"I first picked up this book shortly after it was published in 1989. I finished it 15 years later because I found it languishing in a box in the basement. The Amazon review talks about how wonderful it is that the author spread out a slender thread over 500 pages. But this is exactly what is wrong with the book. It would have probably made a pretty decent 250 page book. All the reader gets in the additional 250 pages is filler, the same slim plot-lines repeated over and over. The ship puts ashore a landing party, the landing party finds nothing, the doctor tells the captain that the landing party has absorbed their limit on radiation. The author also tries to build up \\"suspense\\" in how the women will deal with the men, but I could see the \\"resolution\\" to this 200 pages before the ending. A truly awful book, deserving of NO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This author wrote in long, convoluted sentences that run on and on. He seemed to be trying to impress the reader with his vocabulary. It seemed like he wrote the book using a scrabble dictionary and a thesaurus at his side, using 300 hundred words when only 50 would do. He was so busy writing that he did not bother to tell the story.The basic premise of the story is good. Sex scenes read like medical journals, the characters are one dimensional, the plot is absurd, and the book is painful to read.Having spent 6 years in the Navy, I can tell you that many of the technical details in this book are wrong.I do not recommend this book. I gave it one star because the scale will not let you rate it any lower than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to get into","review":"I have just started this book. It is difficult to get into so there is no compulsion to stay with it. I hope in a few more pages it will become more interesting. Oh, it is about 1100 pages. So it had better get more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read...","review":"This book doesn't even deserve 1 star. I read The Last Ship almost 15 years ago. It was an absolutely miserable experience. The language is convoluted and almost painful to read. It is almost incomprehensible. I am an avid reader and have read a fair amount of literature as well as fiction of all genres. As I recall, the narrator mentions that he is using \\"elaborate language\\" in order to preserve it for the diminished human race. The human race would be better off illiterate. Although the plot is good, the writing is just el-stinko bad. If you want to read this book, get it from the library for free. Don't pay a red cent for this novel. Blech."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Ship","review":"I enjoy reading and make it a habit to finish what I start. This book tested my limits. The author was sometimes interesting in his telling of events and the Captain's thoughts but I found myself wishing that he had edited himself. I actually got to the point where I was skimming pages of boring descriptions. The author must have been in a contest to use as many obscure words as possible and to stretch sentences into pages. I cannot recommend this story unless you have read every other 'End of the World' story and this is the last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a book lover. Don't waste your money!","review":"I read voraciously. I love books, and this one is not good. It is boring, redundent, slow moving, and not very interersing. Out of the thousand plus books I have read this is the only one that was a battle to finish. I would suggest that your money would be better spent on a book by Orson Scott Card (any but especially Enders Game), or Ursula K. LeGuin (The Left Hand of Darkness) Also T. Clancy writes very good war books if that is what you are looking for. But please do not waste you dollars on a book that will not likely bring you pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The world is destroyed and man must rebuild.","review":"Told in a narrative style by the Captain of a Navy destroyer that has released nuclear missles against Russia and comes to find out that the world has been rendered pretty much uninhabitable because Russia did the smae thing to us.This is a story of morality and decision making in the face of horrible odds.

It doesn't have CIA agents named \\"Dirk\\" running around with beautiful reporters in stiletto heels. There's a unique, introspective quality and pensive theme throughout that, if you're listening, takes hold and carries you along.

I sometimes felt I was witnessing Brinkley's attempts at writing the world's longest sentence. This book should have been closer to 300 pages in length as it is bloated with tedious descriptions and subconscious ramblings. At certain points, once I had learned to recognize the beginning of another long Brinkley exercise in over-description or introspection, I simply skipped over it to the next line of dialogue and really didn't miss anything. He needed a tough-love editor.

It is written informally but knowingly by a former clipper captain who had known Donald McKay personally. So far so good. The book, however, is not a standard edition. It has been produced by some sort of facsimile technology, and it's a mess. There are markings, marginalia, etc. by some unknown but no doubt (now) elderly hand. The book, one can tell from somewhere in there, was at one time part of the University of Michigan Library. The several illustrations are for the most part defective due to the process of reproduction. Page 96, to cite one instance, is hardly readable because the right margin is missing four or five letters, leaving the reader the exciting game of word guessing. This is not acceptable, either to the reading public or to the memory of the man of action turned author and historian. Shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bible comes alive","review":"Max is a master storyteller. You feel as if you're spending time listening to the Apostle himself tell the story.

I wish he had used the KJV version, simply for the beauty of the language. Also the NIV has certain passages and sentences missing, so you don't get the full message.

The telescope has changed and is still changing the way we see the Universe and Panek does a very good job at describing the major contributions of this wonderful invention.My only complaint is that the last chapter might be a bit too rushed compared to the previous ones since it basically reviews all modern astronomy in about 20 pages.

Track 1 is the title track and its a marvel of inspired improvisation by the whole band. The rythmic drive is fantastic and at one point Jarrett stops playing Piano and adds to the percussion to push the Sax solo even more.As Jarrett has commented the last track 'Late Night Willie' was very unusual for this quartet. Theres almost a Rhythm & Blues feel to the track. Its quite bluesy, but again what distinguishes it is the fantastic drive. This is 6 minutes of magic.The remaining tracks are of an equally high standard, if different in style. As the previous reviewer stated you can play this over and over and never get tired of it.An essential addition to any Jazz collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stormy, lyrical and luminous","review":"This is European jazz of the highest order. In the absence of a strong Afro-American input it doesn't swing or swagger but the rhythm section is beautifully supple and springy throughout and the lyricism of Jarrett and Garbarek warms the soul.The title track is a stormer, whipping along at a furious pace and sometimes teetering on the brink of madness, yet never losing the plot. It then segues into reflectiveness, setting the tone for the beautiful Prism that follows.Having Jarrett and Garbarek share the spotlight is great for both of them. They play off each other's lyricism and explore purposefully, but without the meandering they're apt to indulge in as solo front men.I actually feel more five stars than four stars about this album but that's because I usually skip the throwaway \\"Late Night Willie\\", a bit of would-be bluesy fluff that doesn't fit the tone of the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate purchase","review":"Our family are huge Spongebob fans.

They had shrunk more than 1 croc size (I was borderline XL/XXL and my XXLs were now smaller than the XLs).To make a long story short, I think there should have been a warning on the label.

There were a lot of references to material that was never explained, other than to plug two other books that he had written which supposedly had the answers. I didn't buy them because I felt the organization here was so poor. In addition, he provides case studies as quiz material, and the content involves questions on materials not covered in the text.The other major problem is that this book is outdated. It doesn't cover SBS 2003 R2, nor does it handle Vista. As a result, some of the guidance is simply wrong now.I finally purchased another book which has been very helpful in learning SBS 2003.

How the wizards work they way they do, the book misses it. If the test only wants to know about wizards, then it is not like the other M$ tests I have taken.All this is said, I have not taken the test and it might fit it exactly.On the other hand, I found the book very useful for tasks involving SBS and it will sort of make a good reference book for my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Study Guide I've Ever Used","review":"I really have to start paying attention to the user reviews before I buy a book!

If this book is supposed to be the 70-282 prep guide, why should the reader be forced to buy another book just to have the material covered?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the only game in town","review":"If only I'd listened to the other reviews first, I might not have bothered with this. It's hard to use a study guide that can't even keep track of the answers - a multiple choice with four solutions should never, ever have a correct answer of 'E'. Even when they keep the lettering choices correct, there's no continenuity between the large, prominately posted answer and the explaination given below. DO NOT USE THIS AS YOUR PRIMARY STUDY GUIDE FOR 70-282. If you're intent on passing the test, use your existing Windows 2003 and Exchange Server 2000 knowledge, and suppliment it with \\"How To Cheat At ...

Content is mediocre, based on how some consultants probably did their implementation.. right or wrong! Practice Questions are highly ambiguous, do not follow common principles and almost half the time have wrong answers. They will confuse you more than they will help you. The authors are well known, but having read more than one of their books, it seems more for their networking ability than technical prowess. I strongly recommend to look somewhere else..... and that is a problem. SBS is 3-6 products rolled into one and if Microsoft Exam people want you to fail, it would be so easy for them. My best guess is to prepare from the Help and documentation you can find on MS website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy compared to Sybex and others","review":"This is the only book I could find to help pass the new MS Small Business Specialist 70-282 exam and I was referred to it by Microsoft trainers at a recent Technet briefing. The editing is sloppy and inaccurate with missing answers and is lacking in prep materials for the exam. The goofy way the authors try to inject humor into the reading is amateurish and borders on ridiculous with all the exclamation points. No way I can rely on this solely to pass the test. Very disappointing compared to the Sybex and Microsoft Press titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will NOT prepare you for the test","review":"Please, do not buy this book if you are taking the 70-282 test. It is horribly out of date, and I would say about 85% of the test content is not even addressed in the book.

I mean, when you wake up and remember a certain type of dream, you want to look it up. So, then I just started reading it as a book, and I found it very useful.

I am \\"white\\" but I have a warm yellow-toned almost \\"Asian\\" skintone and I have come to find that \\"Mata Hari\\" is the color my cheeks blush naturally. I think people with warm toned skin would normally pass a color like this up because it looks almost purple/pink in the pan. However, with the right application it looks really natural on. And by right application I mean very very little product b/c this blush is one of the most pigmented formulas I have ever encountered. It will last you a very long time!! For more cool toned skin I would recommend \\"Desire\\" (a more hot-pink color). Or, \\"Amour\\" if you are looking for more of a warm peachy pink cheek color.

I have tried them with the pleated edge dumpling presses but this makes the outer edge too thick and spoils the texture of the finished product. I thought this product with its narrow edge might be a good alternative, how wrong I was. To start with the instructions are on a 4\\" scrap of photocopied paper, not very professional. They explain that you need to use a \\"shaping form\\" to make the depressions to put the filling in. There is no \\"shaping form\\" or worse still no information on where to get one and this product is unusable without one.

However, since I had to file a chunk of the inside edge, it will not make a good straight edge anymore.You are much better off with the imported machinist's squares such as those by iGaging. At least these are made from steel! Sure, using a low grade alloy is great for Incra as it saves on tooling costs, but it is simply too soft to be used in a work environment in my opinion.

I hope they are taking care of this with their new camera models. Looks like I'll be buying a new camera but it won't be a Canon. Color me unhappy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a Trip","review":"I have other digital cameras with higher pixel count but I bought the Canon primarily because of its size. I am very pleased with the camera, although I think a 3 zoom would have added much more to its value instead of the 2 zoom. I just took an extended car trip through the northwest and carried the camera in my back pants pocket very comfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not enough flash!","review":"I have used this camera since June 02 and while the having digital pictures are a plus, the picture quality when using the flash is below standard - which I define as being the same as a conventional camera. It is my opinion that the flash is not strong enough and the red eye function does not work as well as my previous standard camera.Outdoor / daytime pictures are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera","review":"Easy to use for technophobes, takes great pictures, portable, durable. Only issue is sometimes there is a delay in the camera that makes it hard to get one shot right after another. I haven't found the setting to control that, and maybe there is one, but I'm not sure. Also, it seems to take a while when pressing the button to have it flash sometimes, so if you have an active child, you may want a camera with a more sensitive button."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Most Users","review":"This is my 3rd digital camera and by far and away the most simple to use. I have found the digital quality to be excellent. Downloading my pics is fast and easy with the software that comes with this unit. I believe this is a great buy for 90% of digital users who just want to take pics of their friends and family. Before deciding on this camera, I looked at many ratings of digital camera's on several different websites. I talked to several people in a variety of retail stores deciding that most did not know a camera from a pogo stick. And lastly I talked with many of the people I know who own more expensive models. What I found out was that the folks who buy more features and megapixels...generally don't use their camera for anything more than I do. I just got back from Vegas and believe that some of the pics I took are as good if not better than the postcards I saw. I would rate this product a smart buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome product, really.","review":"The best digitals still can't quite match the best film cameras for those most challenging of shots. But unless you're a professional photographer, you won't even notice the subtle differences, much less appreciate them. For the shots taken by the rest of us, a camera like the Canon S200 is all we'll ever need.The little Canon S200 Elph is remarkable. When you first take it out of the box and hold it, you'll know you haven't made a mistake. It's like a little jewel, artfully designed, solidly constructed. The metallic body is all shimmery and shiny and, well ... Dare I say \\"precious\\"? (If Gollum had one of these, he'd forget all about that stupid ring.)Stop reading the reviews and order one now. If you're disappointed, don't take it back, go see a shrink. You have issues. Seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing little camera","review":"I absolutely love my S200 Elf. I've had it for several months now and it's performed flawlessly. It's easy to use, takes great pictures, has a very simple interface, compact and quick battery charger (and the battery life is incredible). And you just can't beat the size and weight of this thing. My ONLY complaint is that there's no way to default the camera to \\"no flash\\". You have to manually press a button anytime the camera has been turned off in order to get it back to \\"no flash\\" again. It's a minor annoyance in an otherwise perfect camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera","review":"The camera is very durable; the case is metal. the LCD display has great resolution for its size (1.5\\"). Most pictures have been in focus for me, including indoors. The flash works well when used at a practical distance... a few feet (don't aim 100ft away and complain if it's too dark). Battery life hasn't been a problem for me, either. You may want a backup battery if you go out and take lots of pictures like on trips. It's only a 2.0MP camera, so don't rely on the zoom. It comes with an 8MB cf card; good for perhaps a couple movies or a few pictures. Realistically, make sure you can afford a 128MB cf card before purchasing this (or any other) camera. As usual, carry-case (psc-100) sold separately. I like the camera and enjoy taking pictures with it because it's so small and takes clear, colorful pictures. It's not perfect... but it's small and works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a camera!","review":"I've had a couple of digital cameras in the past. None of them was half as good as s200 in terms of performance and exterior design. S200 has a solid metal case which makes it both rigid and looking good. It is very easy to hold. Yeah, sure it is the smallest camera around but controls are definitely not crammed together. The pictures it takes are vivid in color and simply outstanding in clarity. The LCD on the camera is very clear under bright sunlight. I don't know how they did that but no camera I've seen came close on this. The battery life is also very good. It takes only two hours to fully recharge the battery. And it has Chinese language option! Which isn't really all that important to me but it's a plus I can use my camera in my own language. Overall this is a amazing buy. I have countless gadgets and this is certainly one of the most satisfying. The only con I can think of is the price at futureshop for this camera. Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Camera!","review":"I just recently bought a Canon S200 and i have to say, It's ALOT better than most cameras, even some cameras of higher MP. This is because it has a movie recording feature (yes other cameras have this too) but it records with sound! It records about 20fps and maybe lower if u record at max. resolution (640x480). The quality is great(resolution goes up to 1600x1200), it features auto focus, and for experts, you can control the ISO (theres an auto option for newbies). And the reason why I didn't give it 4 stars is becuase in movie mode, the lcd kinda blurs and gains static which is annoying and the quality on movies arn't that great. But, digital cameras arn't suppose to have superior movie qualities, that's what camcorders are for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best small camera in it's class and price range.","review":"I didn't give this camera 5 stars but it deserves 4 1/2 which means I really like it and recommend it over the Casio Exilim EX-S2 which is half as thick. Both cameras were candidates for purchase until I discovered the Canon Powershot S200 produced better pictures for enlargement.I went ahead and purchased it for snapping pictures of machine parts which can be zoomed in on for greater detail through the viewer on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a toy","review":"It's true that Canon S200 is compact, pretty, and well-designed. However, it turns up side down when talking about picture quality. I took some night shots and found unaccpetable outcomes. Usually, I don't use flash for night shots in order to get the atmosphere as much realisitc as I can into my pictures. Pictures from this camera look blur and grainy. Two Megapixel and three-point focus system don't seem to help. Transferring pictures to a computer is another headache. Unlike any other cameras, there is no direct access to a camera from Windows Explorer. I have to install 20 mb software and driver into Windows XP. After using for 30 minutes, I decide to return it. If you are a serious photographer, look for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Camera","review":"I've had this camera about a month now and have shot nearly 300 pictures. My pictures are mostly snap shots but have covered a wide range of indoor and outdoor people shots and landscapes. I've been very pleased with the results. The camera size was the driving factor for me. I had a 35mm SLR that was a pain to carry around and consequently I was missing a lot of pictures. I purchased the camera, extra battery, 128mb card and a USB card reader and everything has worked out great. I've been really impressed with the panaorama shots and the little movies with sound. The included software makes the panorama shots come together easily. Digital is the way to go and this little camera is great for general picture taking. I take a lot more shots now and don't worry about wasting film. My SLR is headed for eBay while it still has some value left in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a charm, first and best camera.","review":"I bought this camera only a little time ago and it has been my dearest pal. It is so easy to use and the options are simple to read so that even a primate could figure out how to increase or decrease the picture size. The movie format is exceptionally, it makes it better because it has a microphone. The USB2 connection makes it attach to the computer. The software that comes with it is interesting for people who don't have programs such as Adobe Photoshop. The battery has quite a lot of juice. Be sure to recharge for more than 4 hours (do it while your sleeping), for a good 2 day or more use. This camera and package comes with everything one would want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pocket camera takes amazing picures","review":"This replaces all my other cameras. This sturdy, pocket size digital camera takes amazing point and shoot instant pics, and has a plethora of options you can set on the small, but high quality digital display. Sensitivity, color depth and resolution are great for high-quality prints up to 5x7. Available light pictures are very good if you hold the cameras steady while shooting. Flash images tend to have strong reds, but correct easily with any digital image processing program, including the one supplied with the camera. Don't forget to set your printer's paper and color Properties. Set the colors to match your monitor and it will be much easier to make any minor corrections to the exposure and color of each print."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Win 7 Driver update","review":"Canon has not updated the driver so that this camera can be used with Windows 7.

It is a very useful study that helpfully contextualises into his social climate. Therefore, Goff goes some way to cast doubt on the common portrayal of Parham as a overt Racist; relative to his time he was not. As well as being a biography of Parham Goff makes a case for arguing that Parham is the clear \\"Projector\\" of Pentecostalism in his theological prescription of Xenoglossa (note: not glossolalia) as this initial evidence of the Holy Spirit's Baptism. The xenoglossa accounts for Goff's argument that Parham's Pentecostalism was a missiological one.I would however note that the debate of pentecostal origins could have been covered in more depth as a greater survey of subsequent pentecostal appraisals of his work.

They must have gotten an advance copy of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought it was just me!","review":"This is the second book I've bought on VB, the first one being an introductory book on everything I need to know about the basics of VB. But since I wanted to focus on database programming, I bought this book and read through it, confused most of the time. Running the sample codes didn't help either. I thought it was only my inexperience with the language that is causing the trouble, thank goodness I found that the other more experienced readers of the book also had similar experiences. I tried swallowing the text up until Chapter 10 and then I finally gave up. If you ask me how I would describe the writing and organization of this book, frustrating would come to mind. I finally gave up and bought another book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing book at best, and the publisher doesn't care?","review":"When I read a book, I capture grammatical errors to send to the editors for the 'next edition'. I collected quite a few early on and decided to send what I had collected so far.The email addresses listed as publisher contacts for this book came back as 'unknown'. I began to wonder: Did they have so many complaint emails they canceled the email accounts?I pushed on through the book to discover coding errors in the examples as well.I give this book a \`thumbs down' and will avoid buying SAMS publishing books in the future.(If I had known about Amazon's rating system at the time I purchased the book, I would have avoided this loss of good $)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please connect sql with visual basic!","review":"I wrestled with this book for weeks. I thought I was crazy. Then I got a book on sql, and things developed a bit.The problem with the book is that it teaches a bit of sql, but never hooks it up to visual basic. Maybe it does somewhere, but darned if I can find it.Lots of stuff, but all disconnected. And all that money......."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does teach database programming with VB5.","review":"This book is sloppy, buggy, and a lot of the code doesn't work, but it can be worth the effort, especially, when it's necessary to port an MS Access application to VB5.The included CD ROM has a lot of useful code which either works or I was able to fix and get working. As an Access developer for many years, I've found it very difficult to come up with good reasons for porting applications to VB . . . but, apparently there are . . . which is why I plowed through this book that I strongly recommend (???) with lots of reservations. The stuff is useful!Sams should try and figure out how to do \\"right\\" by its customers as the book really is a mess. What they've produced here is not much more than a first draft!My advice is to use a pencil to mark all the mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book is unuseful. It contains too many bugs, hard to follow examples, and \\"Stream of Consciousness\\" teaching.Even as an expierienced Visual Basic programmer, I felt lost at times. I ended up learning database programming through trial and error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"To echo many of the other reviews this book is horrible. The example code is riddled with mistakes and the explinations of the code become shorter and shorter as the book progresses.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Good is Our Excellent","review":"The reviewer who preceded me here has given some marvelous background for this album, so let me pretty much endorse his judgments regarding the disc. Although I don't consider this one of the Baltimore Consort's best releases, the group's standards are so high and their repertoire is so engaging that even an average outing by this ensemble is very very good by absolute standards. I heartily endorse this release; pick it up with no fear of buyer's remorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best compact digital on the market","review":"Excelent value for the money, great image quality, solid build quality, and many features not found on other cameras.

I just checked Canon's web site and found out that this camera is not fully compatible with Mac OSX. There are numerous other Canon's that are, but why isn't this NEW Canon model up to speed??? I really wanted to add this digital camera to my collection of Canon 35mm cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera for the travelling people","review":"Compact size, very handy. Quality is good. Price is little high compare to the other same type product in the market. The one of the useful item which I bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent performing digital camera","review":"The S330 is a well constructed and relatively easy to use digital camera (and it's really small, too). It has a good set of features (e.g. video connection for slide shows on a TV, easily expandable memory by purchasing a higher capacity compact flash card, 3x optical zoom, etc.). I definitely recommend getting at least a 128MB compact flash card and a spare NB-1LH battery to make life a little easier. Beyond that, Canon provides all the needed cables and accessories.I've found only two real shortcomings of the camera:1) Autofocus is slow to react in low-light (e.g. indoors).2) 2 megapixels is a little low if you want to heavily crop your images later. You may want to consider the S230, which has a 2x optical zoom, but with 3 megapixels.Bottom line: The S330 is a very good camera for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Camera","review":"I wanted a digital camera that was compact, easy to use with a good zoom capability. This camera is superb. A turn of the dial allows easy movement between picture taking and viewing. The downloading is easy. The camera plugs directly to the usb port so no flash card removal necessary. The battery pops out and has its own tiny charger which charges it up in less than 2 hours. The camera is light and small, easily fitting in a pocket, so easy to carry top baseball games, and any events where I don't want to carry a backpack or purse. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!!!","review":"I bought the Canon S330 and am glad to say im very pleased with it. It takes great pictures and has great features. The camera is stylish with a metalic brush finish. The LCD is bright and vibrant unlike some other LCDS on cameras. The software provided with the camera is easy to use and very user friendly. If you consider buying this camera you should also get an extra battery and carry that around its very small but is extremely usefull considering the battery life is so low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the price","review":"Where is the price of this camera? I couldn't find it anywhere even if I did follow what people said on the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This camera comes with a neat battery charger, too.","review":"I just wrote a review on this super camera, and forgot to mention the battery charger. It is very compact, lightweight and easy to carry along on trips. It fits nicely in a small camera bag, along with the camera, so it should be easy to make sure you never have a problem with a \\"dead\\" battery.

Now I am about to buy this same camera again for me. My only gripe is that you tend to get Red Eyes in many indoor flash pics. If you are looking for a compact, 2 MP and very easy to use point and shoot camera, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precision like the other Incra-products","review":"There is not much to say about this product. It is very precise, enabling you to check those miters and get them perfect every time, ajusting tablesaw, bandsaw and other tools.

Worth the money for an absolute 45dgr reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tool","review":"I don't have a precision weights & measure office in my neighborhood. But from the test I can run from my woodshop it seems to be dead-on. My one complaint is that the angle starts so high on the blade.

I liked it, it took pictures just fine, was a good deal for $140.But it let me down. In Feb. the zoom lens jammed. The first thing this camera does when you turn it on is pop out the zoom, so this turned it into a brick. It is very difficult to get a person on the phone and not voicemail. I sent the camera to Vivitar. They also make you send a check for $5 for return shipping! A month later, I received a replacement. With a bad flash, although I can see how whoever inspecting missed it, because the flash does a weak blink. Now in late April, I'm still waiting for them to send me a mailing label to return the bad replacement, because I've already paid shipping twice and should not have to pay again.

None of the research I did indicated it would be a problem. On the RAZO site it says compatible with reverse ring MT systems- I got the knob as a present- went to install it and the diameter of the ring on my car is larger than the RAZO knob so I am forced to return it.Honestly- it seems to be a solid product, and it's the only reason I gave it 2 stars. In hindsight what is the deal with the stickers included??I can only judge it based on the fact that the description is misleading and they should do more research to make sure if in fact the knob is compatible before putting a blanket product description on it. This is the type of thing which makes you not want to buy any products form a specific manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Fit!!!","review":"I bought this for my brother for his birthday, he has a 2001 Ford F150 & it clearly stated that this stick will fit the model, but of course it didnt & is now sitting in storage.

A great purchase all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great When It Fits","review":"The weight balance, craftsmanship, and assembly procedure are great. Unlike the screw-mounted aftermarket shift knobs, this one has an insert that threads to your particular shift lever so it won't come loose.I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the fact that it does not fit all reverse lockout rings. The 2011 Hyundai Sonata GLS reverse lockout ring is about 2mm too wide, for example. Razo should at least state that it only fits MOST reverse lockout rings rather than just giving a blanket statement like they do. The best course of action would be for Razo to actually list the opening diameter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatherhood is Forever","review":"This is not a study of Proverbs but a study of Christian fatherhood issues for men who have chosen or considering that worldview. In that case FFF would be a great tool for a young men's discipleship study or a father - son study. A hardback copy would be an excellent gift idea. The book is filled with fun, colorful illustrations that make reading easy. The author deals with the usual social ills of words, sex, temper, alcohol, money, work and friends. The strategy of the outline should not be overlooked: What is fatherhood? What are the issues? What will you do? As a father, leader and discipler of four (now seven) children and grandfather of five, this will certainly be a top shelf reference in my library. Men who understand and are in the game should strongly consider this book. If the cover picture doesn't hook you, don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for fathers","review":"This book is an excellent resource for men who want to better raise their children, and become better fathers. It teaches how we can become wiser in a world that is content with dumbing us down and how to stand up for our beliefs and what is right. It uses the Bible as its resource and the examples of wise Biblical leaders such as Solomon.

For example, I had long been interested to learn why Thomas-Seton left the BSA for about 10 years before coming back in the 1920's. Well this books explains it all very nicely. It also describes the powerful impact that James E. West had in forming the BSA as an organization, along with numerous other little known insights.

So when this thing arrives on your door step, and you plug it into your xbox you are going to find out that you can't plug your audio cable in anymore.

The lyrics without the songs behind them carry so much less power. It's surprising to see how vague and imcomplete they feel when read. Most read like one offs, not the powerful statements you hear on the records. And yet, it's great to have them. The power, the book proves, is in the music of the Gun Club . . . the presentation, the fierce heart . . .but the heart, the book shows, was inarticulate in most ways outside the music. It's a one-day read, really slight. It rambles. It's juvenile, high schoolish. There is some insight into the punk chaos (you had to be there to know Pierce hits this chord right), but is that enough? Just not a lot of book here, I'm afraid.

I was pretty grossed out by his attitude toward women, too. His obsession about all things Japanese was also really tedious. And I LIKED the Gun Club.

Listening to it is a truly spiritual experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze fest","review":"Written by an academic who needs to learn how to write for a popular audience. The topic for this book is fascinating. This author manages to make it boring and flat. This would be a nice book for a student of city planning, but it's dry and boring for someone who wants to know the story of a city's demise. There is little to no local \\"stories.\\" Why didn't the author interview folks who moved out? Why did you leave? Why did you stay? What were people's lives like before the war and after? The author never looks at any of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent folk sound, don't care for the pop","review":"She's got a soothing voice suited for folk, but on a couple tracks seeks a pop sound that is rather generic. If you can tolerate chick-pop you might give this album 3 stars.Nice voice, great emotion, bland song writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy Metal from a former Zombie...","review":"This album is really good. The album features former White Zombie guitarist Tom Five on vocals and Guitars. They used old unused zombie riffs to start them off. This album is not entirely like zombie though. it dives into a newer sound, with a mix of doom metal with regular straight forward metal, but does have some of that instrumental sound heard on such White Zombie albums like Psycho-Head Blowout & Soul Crusher. something worth checking out. also look for Tom Five's new band Sonic Medusa. they are working on their first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a 0 if I could","review":"Mine makes the electronic farting noise at least once during every movie I watch and after it's turned off.It is annoying and embarassing while having any friends over.I can't believe anyone would rate this speaker higher than one because most of the time it works.This isn't rocket science. A speaker should not ruin any movies by making loud random noises.Avoid it like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I too was interested in a cheap sub, and this seemed to fit the bill. I read about the farting noise when it went into sleep mode, and figured I could live with it. Well, maybe, but that's not the only issue I had.The amp has two switch positions: \\"off\\" and \\"auto\\". It does not have an \\"always on\\" position, and this is a critical failure. At certain volumes, the auto-sensing \\"feature\\" will put the sub into power-save mode mid-song, overlaying the fart noise on top of the music. At this point, there's no bass, until the volume gets turned up, it senses the signal again, and it kicks back on.In songs with quiet periods, or movies where explosions alternate with dialog, the sub turned itself on and off way too often - it was completely intolerable. I could hear a bass line, then it would be gone, replaced with the fart noise.If you're cranking repetative industrial or techno, you won't have this problem, but users with other applications in mind should pony up an extra $23 for a better sub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please stop farting!","review":"Had this for three months before it developed the dreaded \\"Jensen twelve-inch flattulence.\\" Great deep bass until sleep mode and then \\"brrrAAAAAAPPPPPP!\\" and no signal. Turning it off and waiting a few minutes helps but then it starts farting again! While highly entertaining during romantic movies, it gets downright irritating when you're watching Star Wars and Darth Vader starts passing gas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plate Amp is 2 ohm stable!!!","review":"The only reason I'm giving this sub a high mark is because he plate amp at 2 ohms is incredible. The amp \\"farts\\" because of the capacitors in it get charged from the current produced from the sub moving because of sounds around it. Get a high Q sub that's 2 ohms and sounds good in a 2.5 cubic foot space and you've got incredible sounding sub. I've got an old Audiobahn AW1200 in mine right now and I'm having a hard time wanting to remove it.Plate amp gets hot but pounds music long time..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sub for the price","review":"This subwoofer offers alot of boooom boooom (excellent bass) for the cheap price. It sounds as good as the high end subs. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that when the unit goes into sleep mode it sounds as if it lets out a fart. Apart from this, I highly recommend this sub to people with smaller budgets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds okay when it works.","review":"I purchased a factory-recoditioned JPS12 from an amazon store about a month ago. It arrived quick enough, the box was in good condition.I didn't have a chance to fully test it out until the 20 day, and around that day I realized it was damaged. When the subwoofer was plugged in, but no audio signal was sent - it burped every 5 minutes or so. Contacted the store I bought it from (J&R;) said they couldn't refund my money because it was past their 12 return day period. Called Jensen support, and they verified the item was damaged!!! AAARRGGGHHH.Will never buy recondition Jensen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truth telling","review":"Most of the media treat us like morons. A state of war requires politicians to be creative with the truth and fanatics to lie outright. Bernard Lewis is one of those rare writers who combines erudition with an obvious respect for the intelligence of the lay reader. To be properly informed citizens we need the truth in all of its complexity. Bernard Lewis gives it to us, as far as he can reasonably ascertain it, in a highly readable fashion. Reading his work shows us that nothing much has changed except our capacity to hurt each other on a much grander scale than ever before balanced by our capacity to understand each other across cultural divides on an equally grand scale. I recommend this work to anybody interested in making sense of out present geoppolitical predicament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource","review":"This is a very interesting book, even if you are just flipping through during a quick browse.

Gay and Native American characters does not automatically make this (or any) book mystical or spiritual. Quite the opposite, this book is brutally carnal. Every chapter tries to be more shocking and outrageous than the one before. By the end of the book, I was rolling my eyes and not even caring what ridiculousness was coming next. Save your time and your money and read something else. Or if you must, buy it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunatics","review":"The first two-thirds of this story is very good, with wild but endearing characters and an interesting plot. But then, it seems as though the author dumps all the tragedy and suffering he can possibly think of on the characters, like he is setting up bowling pins just to knock them down. The very end of the book is plain awful, with plot resolutions that are, in turn, nauseating, cutesy, and just plain preposterous, despite the fact that this is a semi-magical realism type of tale. Skip this and read In the City of Shy Hunters. This one is a real mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful (sorry!)","review":"I learned of this book from another book review, and I bought it after reading all the glowing praise below. I kept wondering if maybe I picked up a different book than everyone else! I found the characters flat and lifeless, and the dialogue and narrative unintelligible and meaningless. Gave up (which I RARELY do) after 50 pages or so. Maybe I gave up too soon. I certainly wish that I could have found what so many others found in this book. Thanks for the recommendation anyway, folks. I would like to pass on my own recommendations for books that moved and changed me - The Art of Happiness, by the Dalia Lama, The Greatest Salesman in the World, by Og Mandino, and Like People In History, by Felice Picano."},{"rating":"2","title":"among the highest of reads, and suggestions for salt lake","review":"this book has been for me also one of those life-changing experiences, in which i felt a part of me open up through the characters and their experiences. hoping there's another one by him soon! there are few other books that had a similar effect on me, and they are (for salt lake city, who asked for suggestions) The Bone People by Keri Hulme, Love Medicine by Louise Erdrich, Yellow Raft in Blue Water by Michael Dorris, Book of Ruth by Jane Hamilton, The Secret History by Donna Tartt, and Kitchen by Banana Yoshimoto.

Of course Thyrza never reveals who the father of her child is, and no one guesses Andy. Throughout it all, Barton Gorse loves Thyrza and wants to marry her, but she refuses, believing that if she does, everyone will think Barton is the father. The first half of the book, about Thyrza's childhood, is not so good, but the second half is very fine, though the length Thyrza goes to protect Barton is a bit hard to believe. But despite what it might sound like, Thyrza's strength of character is made memorable by Brown's portrayal of her. Sometimes all the idealistic reasoning, so old-fashioned today, is difficult to fathom, but it's even more difficult not to sympathize, even admire, such characters as Thyrza Tennant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rabbit guard","review":"I ordered this to protect the electric cords in my home from our house rabbit.

Classic Patitucci.","review":"I recently bought this album speculatively, and on the strength of J.P's earlier offerings, which have always been, at the very least, interesting. Sufficed to say, this album played in my car , daily, for all of two weeks.It's an eclectic mix of world-music inspired offerings, varying in tempo and flavour, injected with that distinctive energy, that, to my mind, sets the Patitucci/Weckl combination in a class of it's own. But, for me, the the thing that really clinches it, is that tone that J.P draws from his instrument. Whether he's in the engine room, driving a groove, or nestling atop a gentle melody his tone and touch stand out delectably.Definately one for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Reference","review":"Michael Jacksons books seem to be of two basic types;the handy reference size or the coffee table sized folio or tome.This is one of the later. A large book even by his standards, it will probably be considered the definitive work on Whisky for years to come and take it's place with Gary and Mardee Regans Work \\"The Book of Bourbon\\" as the standard reposistory of all knowledge and wisdom on the subject at least for the masses if not the cognescenti of whisky for years to come.Generously illustrated and well written it is a cornerstone addition to a whiskey book collection. That being said,while a great attempt to cover the field of whisky and full of very useful and entertaining information, it lacks the details of his and others more specialized books on the subject that some may wish to ferret out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile addition","review":"To me, this book is a little more 'coffee-table-book-like' with great info and nice pictures of most of the worlds whiskeys & their environs. there are some guidebook-like reviews of tastings but not as much as MJ's \\"Complete Guide to Single Malt Scotch\\" which should be part of your collection already! i would go for these two before i went for the 'whiskey bible' which is just tasting notes, jmho,,,,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hubby LOVES the book","review":"The man doesn't even read that much and he loves this!

A little bit history, a little bit geography and little bit horticulture. It really does cover all whiskey production, although I think it favors Scotch a bit.

I love books like this one and Pattie LaBelle's Lite Cuisine because many of the recipes offer good options for making food that taste good and at the same time is good for you. I think that this book can stimulate the thought processes regarding changing how you prepare the standard recipes you typically eat at home.

Dont spend your money on a complete new system-just buy a good sub for it! To get the kind of bass levels that I can get now at low volumes I used to have to crank up the JBLs to LOUD! The sound is clean and the built in crossover feeding the JBLs eliminates \\"hard Spots\\". Cant say enough about the system now but I honestly dont know if the Jensen is better or worse than competing brands but it sure works for me and others that have heard the difference.Price$50 CDN-amazing! (the other reviewer mentions \\"farting\\" when starting up or shutting down-weird but true- but is only momentary-also there are 2 completely different hook up methods which may account for the difference on opinion in the boominess-my hookup uses the Jensens internal crossover circuitry to run the satelites)"},{"rating":"1","title":"nice price but the shutdown \\"farting\\" is unacceptable","review":"This just arrived today. Unfortunately I bought this subwoofer without doing enough research on whether or not the \\"farting\\" sound (when it enters standby mode) is a real problem. I'm using the subwoofer in my surround sound TV setup, and for me, I'm getting it about every 20 minutes. This during constant TV watching, when you would think it would be getting a signal and wouldn't go into standby mode. It irritates the heck out of me. Now I have to decide whether or not to send it back (and pay the shipping myself)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sound Tale","review":"This was an interesting tale, and kept me occupied for its total length. During the course of the book, it came to pass that the author was keen on embellishment where he saw fit, and I began to wonder how much of the book was embellishment and how much was actually real. He mentions hardly anything of his day-to-day life outside of his quest, which would have been nice to hear about. There is no mention of where his money to live came from during all these years after he left his wife and kids; nor who footed the bill for his air and land travel. Was he privy to a trust fund, or did his wife give him a stipend? He doesn't mention anywhere getting paid to do his \\"research.\\" The book would have been more balanced had he included more of his \\"real\\" life, as it seems like everything after he left his family was golden."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],B={key:0},C={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(E,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-3962b75f"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/17.md","filePath":"guide/17.md"}'),L={name:"guide/17.md"},P=Object.assign(L,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{H as __pageData,P as default};
