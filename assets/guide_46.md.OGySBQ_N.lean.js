That's nearly $20 less from this combo deal, which contains the same items, am I missing something?I've used this product before, and I can't say if it did anything for me permanently.

I purchased it for my bedroom. The sway part at the top is too large for the hole and frequently sticks, making it extra work to throw your trash away. Also, the size seems much bigger online.

Since I was using it for kitty litter room, I wasn't too worried about it. After washing it and putting a liner in it, I started using it. The lid will not stay on. Every time I try to throw the litter in it, the lid either tilts off or falls off completely. I've tried putting two bags in the can to make the lid tighter, which seemed to help a little, but the lid still tilts off. Which, of course, makes a mess when I try to put the litter in it.

I love the trainer. She is so fit and has a really awesome accent that is just nice to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"Although this workout has a great outdoor setting, it was far from being one of my favorite workouts. The instructor wasn't very likeable and the workout wasn't very intense. It includes a lot of moves requiring you to do a significant amount of balancing (The instructor, in fact, keeps bringing this to your attention throughout the workout - telling you that if you lose your balance to keep trying it. Unfortunately, if you frequently lose your balance, you also lose the benefit of the exercise.) I made through about 25-30 minute of this dvd and then gave up on it. The next day I didn't even feel anything from it, whereas just 10 minutes of some of \\"the 10 minutes solution\\" segments were far more effective.

I saw results very quickly. It works your legs but also your butt and your arms. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent :->","review":"I really love this workout. It doesn't let up from start to end and it uses every kind of move you can think of to get great shape to your legs. There are moves lying down and standing up, with weights and without, pulsing, shorter moves; you name it - the move is here. Violet Zaki even does exercises for developing balance skills. She is a motivating instructor who has done other Self dvds. She cues well which I like because you know what to do and when to do it. She is outgoing without being overly so.The other great thing about the dvd is the 'set'. It's outdoors (like some of their other workouts) and that is motivating in itself because it's sunny even if where you are is cold or wet. This will really challenge you and your muscles will be sore the next day or two. I believe it's worth it though because even though I've only done this three times, I feel as if I see a little more definition. It's great and I think it can deliver what the title promises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best workout in a while","review":"If you can do squats and lunges, this is the workout for you.

I bought this Carpal Mate in beige a few months ago and it helped right away. I am able to type with no problem and it makes the pain and tingling stop.

They did not support my wrists AT ALL no matter where I placed the wrist strap or how tight or loose I made it. If the heel of my hand was resting in the support, my wrist was actually bent DOWN, putting a ton of pressure on the very area that is damaged in the first place. Maybe if I had thicker hands, these would have worked or if I was just looking for something to support my wrists when they were resting on my desk but a sent these back QUICK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep in comfort","review":"I have to wear braces/wrist supports after my CT surgery.

Some are written in Mathematics rather than in English. Others are over comprehensive as an introductory text for laymen. In this regard, I found Kruskal and Wish's \\"Multidimensional Scaling\\" to be the most 'user friendly'( only in a relative sense).In short, this is certainly a monograph with just the right amount of substances for any applied researcher interested in MDS to get started with their work. Fundamental knowledge of statistics is a prerequisite, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"This is the first Black Lace novel I have ever read, however this is not the first erotica novel for me. I must say that I am highly impressed by the author's writing style as well as the story line.

All parties have to give consent. I don't care if it's D/s - the s still has to consent to the role or life - then they can take it wherever it goes. The consent has to be real - not forced, drugged or as a result of eventual wearing down. In this book there is no consent which, for me, means it's not fantasy fulfillment - it's simply the prolonged rape and humiliation of a woman taken as a prisoner of war. Not the slightest bit erotic to me.The second thing for me is f/f. It's never worked for me although I understand it does for a lot of women. Just not something I find at all sexy - quite the opposite.Websites post warnings about \\"non-consensual sex\\" and f/f on even their free stories.This book should have had the warning on its back.Luckily I only paid .50 for the book, but I still wish I hadn't even read as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Sex...","review":"and sexual situations.

Since money is in short supply after replacing their house and possessions, they went with an inexpensive screen.

Needed to use it to keep my 1 year old from the fireplace and its so light, it can easily be knocked over by a 1 year old just pushing on it. Wish I'd of just put my money towards something more sturdy, even if I had to pay a little more. Plus it was dented in a couple spots, but that might have just been due to poor handling during shipping.

There is equally strong praise for the things the auther was pleased by and condemnation of the others. The excessiveness of both put me off. The writing is most moving in parts, but the work is unstrucutured. The author was really a poet, and it tells.

Hamburger Helper typically makes for a pretty tasty quick fix, so I was relatively excites to see this. However I was completely let down. COMPLETELY LET DOWN. I can see why people are having a hard time finding it, I hope HH is doing a recall.This has no real heat to it. The spice isn't a chili pepper flavor that comes to mind when looking at the box. The cooks must have experimented a taste test with burnt tongues because there is a disgusting, TANGY flavor that overpowers the dish like too much cologne dabbed on one who can't smell. You still want to taste the pasta, the hamburger, and other ingredients. Adding some tomato and parmesan didn't help dilute the taste of that awful \\"chili\\" flavor.I had to toss out a two packs I made for the whole family and a whole pound of ground beef, because we all felt nauseous. Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A whacking good read!","review":"A great read! Games of Command is good! Just plain GOOD! I just finished it and my only regret is that it isn't longer or the first book in a long series! I WANT more!GOC can stand-alone as either science fiction or romance and evidently many bookstores are caught in that quandary since I've see it shelved in both! But don't be fooled, the science fiction aspect of the story is good! And the romance is woven through the story like a thread that holds the whole thing together and produces a bit of tension between the characters!GOC is well written with good action, a believable universe and romance. Yep, romance. But it's not a romance with a bit of science fiction - it's science fiction with a good bit of romance. But the romance isn't there as a coating on the story, its part and parcel of the story and it shows!Linnea Sinclair writes well and takes the time and effort to make her universes believable and enjoyable. Thank you Linnea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So thankful that I found this author","review":"Once again multiple award winning author Linnea Sinclair has fulfilled her writing legacy, and written a novel that captures a world where Sci-Fi and fantasy reign supreme. As in Sinclair's previous novels(Finders Keepers,Accidental Goddess,Gabriel's Ghost,and WinterTide) she creates a universe filled with adventure, treachery,honor,eternal love,and absolutely the cutest pets ever. Throw in a cyborg Admiral in \\"lusty\\" love, a space pirate who unknowingly holds the clues to save a universe, and the women that are essential for their salvation, and you are just getting started on the adventure of a life time. I highly recommend this book,and all of this author's previous novels.Bon Appetit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Futuristic Adventure / Romance","review":"I enjoyed this book so much! After reading so many of the new wave of Sci-Fi ebooks on the market today, it was such a relief to find such a well written, gripping story writer that I had till now missed. It is most frustrating to read all the poorly edited e-books so I also welcomed the great editing this book brought with it.This story involves 4 main characters - Tasha Sebastian, Kel-Paten, Jace Serafino and Eden Flynn and some cuddly telepathic/teleporting furzels.I enjoyed the building affections and respect between Sebastian and Kel-Paten and was delighted in the progression of their relationship throughout the book.If you enjoy sci-fi - you will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"Fans of Piers Anthony were blessed with the chance to know the author better in his Auto-bi-Ogre-phy, \\"Bio of an Ogre\\", but we truly get to know more about him when we read his letters.

But then decided to turn something that was really special into a quick fast buck, not only making him wealthier, but also enhancing this entire sensitive guy image that bring on the adoration of his fans.

We are all eagerly awaiting the shipment of the second season. I too will pre-order the third season as soon as I see it advertised.MD is a wonderful series; the characters are extraordinary. You absolutely care what happens to them. The storylines are generally good; the action gets spread around to several characters and keeps it interesting.

The authors did a good job and enclosed as much information as they could in less than 400 5*8 inch pages. The definitions include terms from marine biology, physical, chemical, geological and biological oceanography. With about 1800 terms, many of them cross referenced, I have only failed to find what I was looking for a couple of times. There are generous illustrations, and I don't think it could have been more visual given the size. The term entries seem a bit lopsided with some things being given more coverage and others merely touched on. I think that maybe the editors should have caught this, or perhaps two volumes, one for biology and one for the rest.All in all this encyclopedia would be useful to anyone interested in the multi-disciplined nature of marine science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality","review":"Bought these to make luminaries, but only the orange and yellow really allowed the light of the LED tea lights to show through.

Other then that it is nice, I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I have had these speakers for a while, and they are wonderful! They get extremely loud for the size and are very portable. The sound quality and such is great, and it is very durable-if it can withstand 8 hours in a hot/sunny nursery, then it is considered durable to me. The only two drawbacks were that the remote didn't work all that well(which wasn't that big of a problem) and the speakers seemed to shorten my battery life of the player itself. After using the speakers, my Zen's battery began to last only 4-7 hours instead of it's normal 10-12+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really buggy product...","review":"Like all Creative products, the peformance is amazing, but this product also has too many bugs.

Maybe my purchase was defective, but they have really disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very low reliability...","review":"I bought this from Amazon, not thrilled with the sound quality but it was ok. Then, one day, it simply stopped working. It won't turn on. And Creative really provides no support at all, so when it stops working you might as well just throw it away. $116 wasted!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I purchased this speaker set from a store that was going out of business for a mere $25 to go along with my Zen MP3 player. It's nice to have a product that's streamlined with your music player, but I wouldn't have paid any more for the speakers, considering the price isn't up to par with the price. I like my music LOUD and this gets medium volume at best without going fuzzy. Still, it's loud enough for my bedroom and hotel rooms when I'm traveling so it's not too bad as long as you don't pay too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Traveling!!","review":"I bought this for myself before going on a four month long trip traveling.

It is convenient and simple to use. My 9 year old uses it and it is sturdy enough that I don't have to worry about it getting broken. The hard case has a flip over cover and it also comes with a soft carrying case. It is great on trips, especially when you don't have a computer with you to charge your Zen.

The sound is surprising good, and the remote is a neat extra.I love the fact that it has a cover to help protect the system when traveling and it's compact to not take up a lot of space. There are also several power options from plugging directly into the wall to running off a computer's power supply to compete portability with 4 AA batteries. I'm going to be traveling to places that won't always have electricity so I'm excited that at least my music can still go with me! Then, when I can plug in I won't have to worry about using up all my batteries.Overall, very satisfied and glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned out after only one week!","review":"I made sure to use gloves when installing this replacement bulb, but it only lasted one week!

The latches that hold the tray and the cover are thin and plastic and don't look like they would last for long for even a moderate user. The \\"title tray\\" totally did not work. Again the latch appeared to barely move upon pressing the release bar.

I originally ordered this item from QVC and loved it. I saved so much space by consolidating my DVDs into this compact storage unit. When I decided to buy a second unit, I decided to go with Amazon because I have Amazon prime and the price was comparable to QVC. However, when the unit arrived today, I discovered that the album is not included. In my opinion, the album is important to the system because we can browse the titles easily, my 4-year old can pick his movies on his own, and the album lets me preserve the covers. I'm going to return this item and buy another one from QVC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nice","review":"There was a picture of one a little further down the page and a special price if the second one was bought.I was not happy with the second one that I got.

It shows how those born to wealth sometimes abuse their privileged positions and lose all they own. Although these things make most other books interesting, they don't work too well in this book.

I usually read a book in a day to a day and a half; this one took nearly a week. I shall buy her next book and hope it is back to what she usually produces. I really feel the character of Patrick was not given a good storyline. Poor Madelyn was just that: poor. She had no business going anywhere on her budget and that she let her exfiancee take such advantage of her with no reprisal is just unbelievable. She should have taken him to court first and when she got reimbursement for his obvious unlawful use of her and her life, she could have then taken the trip to Scotland if that was her dream.

I still think my favorite MacLeod is Jaime, and he's here too as well as Ian and the rest of the MacLeod lot.

I went back to Best Buy and asked the sales person if the picture on the Westinghouse could be improved. He said it was as it good as it could be. He than said the Sharp was twice the price of the Westinghouse, so I should expect a better picture on the Sharp.In any event, I purchased the Sharp on Amazon during the recent Electronic Express Sale.

I recommend it to all teachers and students and American history for within the pages are academic, creative, and wholestic ways to approach learning and living. The book clearly sparkles with Native American philosophy/religion (ecosophy)which thought provokiing and clearly stated. The text weaves the traditional symbols and Indigenous American social customs into the modern educational practices of the USA. Respectful, multifaceted and interesting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ole story","review":"I bought this old dvd version in 2004. If you have this dvd I would rather save money for it.

This album reminds me of Heart back in the 70's with Dreamboat Annie/Magazine/Little Queen. Sand is my favorite cut, I play it on the piano everyday. Two black lambs and Elysian are also two favorites. I love these guys and they have seldom let me down. Keep doing, girls! We need you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to have Wilson sisters' vintage sound back.","review":"I've been a HUGE fan of the Wilson sisters since Dreamboat Annie's release (I was 13) and have enjoyed their subsequent releases immensely. This album was greatly welcomed into my CD collection since The Road Home - I always eagerly await new material. Whirlygig has the sound of some of their earlier music; free and easy - like they really had fun recording it. Sand is a real gem - I play it daily on the piano; really satisfying. Thanks Ann and Nancy for coming thru again and again. See you at the Beacon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ecclectic mix of mellow music. I love it.","review":"I'm not much of a reviewer, but I feel that this album is fresh and relaxing to listen to.

I really love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it could be.","review":"This isn't Heart. And they don't try to be.

This cd is the Lovemongers: battle of evermore (Led Zeppelin), a cover song, belted out by Ann and Nancy, at their best. Another cover song, Papa was a Rollin' Stone, is another great example of the harmonies , from the Lovemongers, although no longer in print, this continues to be one of my favorites, now, if we could only get WNEW FM, 102.7 NYC, to release the interview/acoustic session with Nancy Wilson, I could die happy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in print on the health policy process","review":"I have used this book for a number of years now in a class I teach on the Politics of Health Policy (along with Kingdon's classic). It provides an excellent overview of how health policy is made and the politics around it, drawing on both the academic literature as well as recent policies. The second edition is heavily revised from the first and contains up to date examples. An excellent academic overview of the health policy process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written with understandable examples","review":"Very well thought out. A delight to read given the subject matter. Some of his SQL tricks will inspire even the most advanced DBA to try new things. Covers the subject very well, from theory to practical application on several of the top database packages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate, but not great","review":"I must disagree with the other reviewers. This book was recommended for a undergrad course on DBMS at UC Berkeley. The chapter on relational algebra had lots of good examples, but the book went down hill from there. The SQL examples and problems were trivial and shallow compared to the relational algebra ones. The ESQL section was pretty good, but vendors' on-line reference material made it redundant. While an overview of DBMS implementation was given, it was almost completely useless when we had to write our own DBMS from scratch. The only highlight in this section is a pretty clear example of insertions into a B+ Tree (even though the book calls it a B tree ). All in all I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acts 29: 50 Days to Invite the Holy Spirit","review":"Great perspective and encouragement to reach out beyond ourselves and, as a plus, using 10 chapters of the Book of Acts for rationale and motivation for same."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SWINGING SIXTIES","review":"NIGHT GAMES is a quick read (150-ish pages) but a gripping one, due to its engaging tale of sex and sin among the rich. The heroine is a 40 years old New Yorker who is looking for love in all the wrong places during the swinging sixties. The author delivers a fine grade-B offering �� la Susann with enough shocking details and innuendos to satisfy any jet set frame of mind. From a male queen bee to a bunch of desperate individuals caught in their own wicked little world NIGHT GAMES stands out for its against the current plot and its very marginal climax. You'll either dig or dislike the book message, depending on your viewpoint about rose-colored endings. That said, if you ever cross this title, give it a chance and see what all the fuss is about.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass Shelving Unit","review":"This is one of the best shelving units in the market when it comes to story your cds. It is very contemporary looking and causes people to look at your cd collections just because of the shelving itself! You dont have to put cds on this nice glass unit, you can put decorative items on it as well. The racks are very easy to install and you can take it out with just as ease. Its very nice with its dark black color and has a very sturdy look and feel. Great value for the price your paying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read for a great intro to our country's leaders","review":"This book is a great introduction for all of the U.S. presidents. The information for each president is presented unbiasedly (as unbiased as information can be at least) and includes a detailed summary of each president's administration, childhood, religious views, education, family, retirement, career before the presidency, military experience, and death.Two features of this book that I especially liked were the portraits of each president at the beginning of each chapter, and also a ranking of the first 32 presidents (compiled by noted historians in 1962). Another thing I liked about the book is the section where each president is praised and criticized by his other noted colleagues.This book is a necessary reference tool for anyone interested in U.S. history or presidents. I would recommend reading about one president every night before bedtime; that's what I did and now I know all 43 presidents of our great nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be on all bookshelves!","review":"This book was a great investment. It offers all the basics on every President but also includes the \\"little things\\" like what John Adams liked to do in his spare time or how three past Presidents died on the same date (July 4th). I've already marked many pages with my highlighter and post-its. You'll find yourself starting conversations with friends with interesting factoids like how George Washington died (strep throat)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this book","review":"I think a lot of the adults leaving such negative reviews on here have forgotten that this was a book written for teens. You are complaining that it does not stand up to adult authors who write about vampires but this was not written for that audience. Of course the teens,young adults and even older adults are enjoying this series. It is fun to read and has a dashing young (or old) leading man. Who cares if it is not Anne Rice...it is still an enjoyable book! Personally, as an older reader, I enjoyed getting pulled into the storyline and feeling like I had butterflies in my stomach when Bella was around Edward...it took me back to my first crush and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Reviews of Twilight Are More Interesting to Read Than the Book Itself","review":"As I said....I had more hysterical fun reading the one star reviews of this book than I did reading the actual book. It is so laughably, horribly, awfully bad. Its incomprehensible how it was published. It isn't even fun trash novel reading. The characters are poorly drawn, the plot is non-existent, and the writing...oh God the writing...Edward is constantly \\"smirking\\" and letting out \\"low chuckles\\" (the low chuckles...oh I'm laughing hysterically again...there must have been at least six of those in the first few chapters alone). Like most poor writers who can't set up and tell a story with any narrative skill, she relies on endless (and repetitive) adverbs and dialogue tags to describe the story.Amazon one star reviewers....thanks for the laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no no","review":"Why is everyone so in love with these books? Besides the fact that the fans are either 13 or 51 years old and have never read a vampire book before. Here is my biggest beef with the books: It's a Dark Shadows rip off!

I was not aware airports had windows that a person could roll down, up, sideways or in any other direction. But perhaps I just expect too much?How can anyone take seriously an author (no less a published one) who makes such a basic mistake in sentence structure?

Go check it out at the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please deliver all readers everywhere from vampires and zombies!","review":"I'm so tired of all the attention that vampire and zombie literature is garnering. ALL of, including Meyers' series is \\"literary dung\\"; destined for the ash heap in a few years. Truly unmemorable, poorly written, stereotypical shallow characters. The only thing imaginative about it is the dollar signs that the author imagined when she cranked out this truly egregious crap. To me, it would be the sort of thing that appeals to 12 year old girls, right along with the \\"My Little Pony\\" movies and Justin Bieber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"I'll just cut to the nitty-gritty...Yeah, I know this book has a few factors working against it (characters aren't very relatable, Bella is a ticking time bomb, ect.) BUT... I must point out that this book was very easy to read and retained much more dignity than many other trashy teen novels I have read in the past (mainly Gossip Girls). Give Stephanie Meyer her props. After all she DID come up with some original vampire history that was interesting. Sure, she COULD have made her characters sound less mature, but let's remember that her writing is much better than an author who tries WAY too hard, using profanity and mentioning different acholic beverages every few pages. I say cudos, Stephanie Meyers! I haven't enjoyed reading so much since Little Women and Pride and Prejudice. I pray a sequel is in the works. Say what you want, it is a respite from all of the otehr generic materal out there aimed at the teen girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay I'm writing a good review cause i saw none","review":"this book has been the buzz of my school all year. Honestly i didn't want to read it didn't seem like my kind of book. I'm young but i like adult books a lot. I finally gave in and read it... it was great. I couldn't put it down. I've seen that a lot of adults don't like it, but it is more of a teen book any way. All the people that i know that have read it really liked it then again we are all pre-teens and teenagers. so i suggest if you are 11-18 this is a good love/fantasy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic plot line- stop here, don't read this book!","review":"I had a friend recommend this series to me. I don't know when I have read a more ridiculous story. Yes, I read it all, much to my shame. It was a complete waste of time. The writer is more capable of a better plot line than this- clearly she has ability. However, the story line bogs down with tedious, long winded words about the \\"romance\\", that goes on for far too long. By the time the author moves on to something somewhat more interesting, it is in a ridiculous direction for the story to go and it makes you drop your book and groan- literally. There are so many more interesting books to read, just don't waste the money or time on this one. Fair warning- not on the next ones either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new.....","review":"I have to admit, I've always been a fan of vampire literature (and television.) I'm confused, however, about the immense popularity of this series. The writing in and of itself just isn't very good- and the characters seem exceptionally two dimensional (and I don't want to be verbally abused here) but very unintelligent.And I have to admit- I was kind of shocked to see just how similar much of the storyline and ideas were to the writings of L.J.Smith-another young adult writer- whose work is MUCH more enjoyable to read.I would suggest buying this book- while it's not well written or anything new, it is somewhat enjoyable. I would, however, also seriously suggest taking a look back to older (though less popular) writings like L.J.Smith's Secret Circle/Vampire Diaries series. You'll love her work if this is your kind of thing- trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I bought this book after reading various reports of Stephanie Meyers' horrible writing ability. I had previously read The Host and found it enjoyable, so I was skeptical about the bad reviews I had encountered. It turns out they were all true. I couldn't even finish this one. Bella is an awful main character. The writing is clumsy at best. The story leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Writing","review":"I don't want to waste anymore of my life on this book so my review will be brief. I do not understand the popularity of this book. It is poorly written. The characters and relationships portrayed are shallow, unhealthy, and annoying. The dialogue is insipid and embarrassing. I'm genuinely surprised that I suffered through to the end of it. There are SO many books that are more worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A two word review.","review":"1. Utter2. GarbageI tried, I really tried to like this book. My 15yo daughter loves the whole series to the point where she's read them three times, and in the interests of sharing her joy, I started reading Twilight. But I couldn't finish it, it was so boring I'd read a page or two and fall asleep.Bella comes across as a brainless, immature twit and her knight in shining alabaster, Edward, is drawn as a brooding, controlling, not very interesting or chatty social leper. Pity he wasn't drawn and quartered.I'm totally at a loss to understand how this series got to the top of the best seller lists and stayed there for so long....and is still there, when there are so many more excellent novels much more deserving of a place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read.

I usually love fantasy books especially ones about vampires.Sadly, I could not finish the book. It's horribly written and catered to mainly 12 yr old girls. I found the characters unlikeable, shallow and superficial, especially \\"Bella\\" who doesn't give a damn about you unless you happen to be the most gorgeous guy on the planet. And how many times was Stephanie gonna mention that he \\"dazzles\\", give me a break...Poor writing with weak plot.I'm saddened how many copies this has sold when there are so many better and original authors out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good FICTION","review":"OK...I own and have read the book(s). I think it is a great story regardless of any typos that might have occured. Worth the read if you are into \\"FICTIONAL\\" reading. It is supposed to be for fun, not to be taken seriously. I do not take what is written in a fictional book seriously...That is why it's called fiction and NOT truth. People want to read into the series way too much when all it boils down to is a good story. You can read for yourself and find out whether or not you agree. You either like it or you don't. End of story. Everyone is entitled to their opinions and I happen to like this book and the ones that followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Literary Masterpiece!","review":"Stephenie Meyer's New York Times Bestseller has taken the world by storm much as did Harry Potter. However, the world she has created is unique and just as captivating to its audience. Forbidden love, fear and obsession like one has never known. Twilight will keep the reader hungry for more much like a vampire thirsts for blood.-Tenaya Jacob, author of \\"Seasonings of the Soul.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"This review isn't so much about the storyline of the Twilight series as it is about the rumors/concerns that I've heard. I had heard quite a few negative comments on the Twilight series and wasn't going to read them. However, my twelve-year-old god-daughter wanted to read them and I wanted to make sure they were appropriate and whether the negative concerns that I had heard/read were founded. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the entire series. Yes, her characters(Bella, Edward, Jacob) came across with co-dependent behaviors, but nothing of great concern. My god-daughter enjoyed the series and I laughed when she voiced her irritation at some of the characters co-dependent behavior. That is what you want as an author, reaction to what your characters do. I wouldn't recommend the books for anyone under age 12, unless they are mature enough to handle some of the subject matter. Overall it was a good vampire romance.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!","review":"I was very skeptical of this book at first... a love story involving vampires? I don't even like vampire stories.... it actually took awhile for my friend to talk me into reading it.But I read it, and couldn't put it down! Finishing around 5:30 AM! I fell in love with the story and all the characters.... I can hardly wait to read book 2.....!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"I'd been intrigued by talk about the third installment of this series but I knew I needed to start at the beginning. On a day with nothing to do, I went out to the bookstore to get \\"Twilight\\". 8 hours later, I was done because I just couldn't put it down. I went out the next day to get \\"New Moon\\" because I wanted more.Just like with Harry Potter, this is not a series for just one age group. Also, the characters are so real and the situations are so well written that even though it's completely ridiculous for this to be real, you feel like it could be real. You don't even need to be into vampire stories to love this series. These books will appeal to anyone who wants to read about true, passionate love. Meyer's writing style is so wonderful. Edward and Bella haven't done more than kiss but with the way she writes it, it's more exciting than if she had written a graphic sex scene.I would recommend this series to any and everyone and I'm eager for a fourth installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"by far the best read of the year !!!","review":"OMG I am 56 years old and cannot believe I feel this way about this book, actually, all 3 by Ms. Meyer.......I have my whole family hooked on her novels (the first time they ever believed me on a recommendation ! ) how can I make it through fall of 2008 until book No 4 ?!?! great read !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected surprise","review":"Twilight was referred to me by several friends. Initially I dismissed the idea because the book's target audience was not for my age. After quite a bit of prompting I bought the book. If I had known what I was missing I would have read it when it first came out. I am officially \\"addicted\\" to this series. This book is well written, captures the reader immediately and doesn't disappoint. This is one of my favorite books. The relationship between Edward and Bella is mesmorizing. You, the reader, are desperate to follow their path to see where it leads. I can't say enough. I have shared this book with several other people, younger and older than myself and they have all loved it as much as I do. Definitely a winner!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a well written book.","review":"My sister introduced me to the Twilight saga and I'm very happy to say that she did. The book was a well written series. There was only one problem that I had with the series and that was the character of Veronica. (If you haven't read the series STOP now!!!) To me the start with the character was that she was unstopable and then in the 3rd book she comes to death in one chapter. To me this seems unfair towards that character and the build up that she was given. Other than that I would highly recommend the series to anyone and trust me it gets addictive. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I picked up Twilight on a whim--I had heard it was popular and that there was a movie coming out, so, I decided to read it. I am older than the target audience--22--but completely game for any good story.In short, I liked the novel. Some of the writing could have been tightened--the use of \\"grimaced\\" and \\"scowled\\" bordered on absurd. Also, in the first book a hint of what I -hated- about the next two started to appear: Bella's irrational, codependent love for Edward (which even he seems to think is a bit unhealthy). I think the story could have been much deeper if Bella had developed into a stronger character.That said, I enjoyed the story and, at the time, couldn't wait to get my hands on the sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE TWILIGHT","review":"I LOVE TWILIGHT, NEW MOON, ECLIPSE, AND BREAKING DAWN-----4-EVER!!!!!!THEY ARE THE BEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Addictive","review":"When I realize that I have a stack of Meyer's Twilight saga in my bookcase, I cringe a little on the inside.

I have a hard time finding books i can stay focused on and enjoy reading, Twilight is my very favorite book.I've already read it twice.I love the way Bella and Edward slowly become closer and closer, even with the issues between them. With Edward being a vampire, i think Stephenie showed both Edward's, Bella's, and even the Cullen family's struggles very well.

I got about half way through, and I could go no further. Maybe it's the writing style that didn't do it for me, or the whole cliche thing about falling in love with a vampire. Whatever it was, I've no idea why this book is so popular. From what I've seen, the only people who seem to enjoy this series are teenage girls who never read anything else, but heard from their friends how \\"great\\" the books are, and got into them because they don't have anything to compare them to. I'll take Anne Rice and Lestat any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of cute...mostly boring and redundant","review":"So I don't know why people LOVE this book. My opinion is that its...just okay.

I'm all for a great vampire story - but this one has absolutely no depth whatsoever. Unless you are a semi-literate teenager there is no way you could find this story interesting. The writing is so elementary it's impossible to get interested in the characters. I know what a hit this has become but I'm really scratching my head over this one. The writing style should never be a distraction to the story. But, I kept finding myself noticing how the words were put together instead of the story. The dialogue is painful. What a disappointment.

Her annunciations are distracting and the \\"voices\\" she develops for the characters are embarrassing. She really has no business being a narrator. I'm extremely disappointed in the franchise for going this route and apparently she narrates all the audio books--gah! Do not buy this audio book, just read the books yourself, you will be glad you don't start here. If this is your first venture into Twilight, run!

Ms. Meyer needs to get over her fear of the word \\"said;\\" her endless, awkward \\"encouraged me\\"s and the like became quite distracting. The phrase \\"'Shh,' he shushed me\\" made me laugh out loud at what was supposed to be a tender moment.I would recommend Cassandra Clare's Mortal Instruments trilogy over this book any day.

You can't stop them, but you definitely can read them along with your child. I read all 4 books to help my 12 year old wade through the mature themes covered in these books--divorce, self esteem issues, stalking, gang rape, abortion, murder, just to name a few. I think it's important for girls to understand that they cannot build their world around another person. Also, that it is OK to want things (money, beauty, popularity, sexual relationships, etc.), but if you want those things too much, it always leads to trouble. Be a parent - talk to your kids. These books are interesting, and they do open up communication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the young reader","review":"I finally broke down and read this book after three different people told me they were positive I would like it.

There are too many well written books out there to waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intresting","review":"I am not a teen so I had never heard of this book until I saw the movie trailer for it, and I was curious. A friend of mine brought the book and said it was really good, and I had to see for myself. Overall this was a very easy read, and the book manages to capture your attention some how to the point, where you can't put it down.

This is a great book for teens and for people who just want to pass the time with some light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"I'll give Twilight this: it keeps you reading. But in a way that you want to just know how it ends and never touch it again. The way she describes the vampire Edward is just TOO MUCH!

I have always considered myself a reader, but once I read this book, I saw how incredibly illiterate I am. It is very refreshing to have found one of those rare stories in a genre full of junk that is actually significant and stands out. Anyone who has ever fallen for the mysterious guy is morally obligated to read this book. It's like I was sucked into a black hole that spit me out in the middle of Forks, Washington where I witnessed Isabella and Edward's entire struggle. I tip my hat to Stephenie Meyer for this fabulous change of pace in the teen genre. You're not going to find any amount of adventure this intense in any other book for a very long time. This book is flawless."},{"rating":"2","title":".. Lovely ..","review":"The Story : entertaining, romantic, suspenseful. Bella decides to live in Forks. There she meets Edward, the vampire hates her guts on the first day of school, but ends up falling in love for the first time. You'll find out why when you read this. Enough said- dont wanna give away nething else.My opinion : GREAT BOOK !! the writing deserves more than 5 stars. I'm no fan of vampires, but this book was just so captivating, i had to keep reading. THere are no boring parts. I told the story to my sister nd friend whom both hates books - they LOVED it !!<u>For those who want more</u>: I think this is a trilogy. The Next book is NEW MOON, out on OCT 2006.

The first thing that I just couldn't get around is the tone of the writing. I mean, I know that this book is directed towards the younger crowd, but jeez I felt like Stephenie Meyer was talking to me like I was 7 years old. The story was boring to read and I felt like no matter how many pages long this book was, that nothing really happened. I was very disappointed in the first book of the Twilight series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should not be so famous","review":"OverratedNot a good role model for young readersI can't believe this has gotten so big, I just do not get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just crap","review":"I saw lots of people reading this book on the commuter train so I thought I'd give it a try. It was so crappy I didn't want to waste my time finishing it. Lots of others have already explained in detail why it's rubbish so I won't go over it all again. My advice is just steer clear of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely phenomenal!","review":"This book is absolutely amazing, it has changed and helped me through so many ways. It helped me overcome my depression and taught me to believe that true love does exist. I recommend this novel with two thumbs way up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bafflement","review":"I have to admit I'm totally baffled at the popularity of these books. I won't be buying any beyond the first, for sure! I don't think this book would have held my interest past possibly Jr. high .... I've found it, well, boring - not very imaginative - requiring absolutely no thought or reflection on the part of myself as the reader. The only reason I went with 2 stars was that some young girls may be interested. I'm sure glad I didn't buy all 4 which would have been my normal M.O."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are not embarrassed.","review":"You know you read books that are like television. If books were cities, this book would be a mall in a city. Or a city that has a tourist industry based on its proliferation of outlet stores. This book was worse than DaVinci Code (Angels and Demons was better, television still). Go visit a real city, unless you are a teenager and then you aren't ready for a real city. Wait, it wouldn't hurt to visit one anyway - so I'll take that back. Go buy a real book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight is a must read!","review":"It's been years since I've picked up a book, boy was I missing out! I am so glad I was able to read this book before the movie came out. Twilight is one book I could not put down, not even to eat! Stephenie Meyer will draw you into Edward and Bella's world and leave you begging for more. No matter what your age, you'll love this book and will want to read the rest of the series, New Moon, Eclipse, and the much anticipated release of Breaking Dawn on August 2, 2008."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am absolutely in love","review":"I was very skeptical when this book was recommended to me. I don't like horror movies and I could care less about vampires. I am not a teenager and am over 35.However, I am completely in love with Edward Cullen. I have been converted. This book was fascinating. It was so hard to work and concentrate while reading it.The characters are captivating. I was glad that I had already bought book 2. I started it right away and it is just as amazing as Twilight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Masterpiece","review":"Stephenie Meyer creates a haunting, all-consuming lovestory in a once-in-a-lifetime tale of fantasy and romance. The setting is immaculate. The plot is mesmerizing. The conflict is astouning. Meyer's writing exploits all the senses, leaving the reader lusting for more of Bella and Edward. The story will keep the reader greedily consuming from page one, all the way through to the heart-stopping conclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice story ... I was surprised I enjoyed it.","review":"Optimistically good. I hesitantly read this, mainly because of all the hype, but it was actually a good read. I'm reading the others in the hope they're just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have loved this book when I was 17","review":"I can see how a teen-age girl would think it was great. It was written for a younger crowd. However, don't bother with it unless you're a teen or are a fan of Harlequin romance - or unless you like stories where the two main characters spend all of their time scowling, glaring, bickering or being \\"dazzled\\". In fact, you may want to read this before you let your impressionable young girls read it. Edward is too controlling and jealous for a healthy relationship. That said, about half way through the book became at least entertaining enough to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This was a fantastic book, the relationships are built so well and its a total page turner. I couldn't put the book down and finished the whole book in a little over a day, and yearned to read the next book. Its been a long time since I've been able to sit down to enjoy a good book, usually too busy to find a book that keeps me entertained long enough to read it, but this book kept my interest and page by page, I never wanted it to end. Loved this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"Def liked the book.. made the mistake of watching the movie first.. there were a lot of details left out of the movie (i.e. cullen family history, how everyone came to be) the timing is a little messed up in movie too as is how the events take place.. but i'm not reviewing the movie.. i read this book in one day.. yes.. i did.. and it was great.. if your a girl.. you will love this book.. you will want to be bella and you will fantasize about Edward and blush everytime she talks about how he makes her feel.. that for me is a well written well described book.. i'm starting the second story (New Moon) I hope its as good as the first! if you like this fantasy stuff.. this book is for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a LOOOOOOOOVE story...","review":"Yeah um-not really feeling the \\"whole vampire thing\\"-the book seemed to be about a teenage love story-it was a hit at my job and I am 30+ was the only reason i read it(can't explain that)Edward being a vampire had nothing to do with anything, and they really didn't seem to be that in looooove, and the way the vampire charaters are described, couldn't somebody be able to tell in that small town that something was wrong with them FOLKS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertained","review":"I got this because of the hype and the long commute between work and home. Really enjoyed it! Better than getting irritated with stop and go traffic on the freeways. Now I look forward to my drive. I ended up purchasing the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book Ever!","review":"My friend got me this book and I hadn't heard anything about it. So I started reading it and \\"head over heels\\" fell in love with everything (the characters, the story, Edward...). I couldn't put it down. I felt like an addict because I needed more and more and more of this vampire love tale. I highly recommend this book to everyone, no matter your age, if you just want to get away for a while. Just be prepared to read the complete saga because you won't be able to stop after you get started!"},{"rating":"2","title":"vampire","review":"this book is not like any other vampire novel. it contains emotion and action. the story is just simply amazing. definitely a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Read","review":"In Case you don't want to read my full opinion... Definatly a must read, it was amazing, I finished it in two days.I have read all of the Vampire Chronicle(they are definatly books you should look into, if the first one isn't very exciting for you, make sure you at least read the second one, you'll be hooked.) and I have just recently read Blue Bloods (also a good read). I am usually very picky when it comes to reading vampire books because I really hate all the cheesy, typical, sometimes scary vampire books. But a librarian at my school convinced me to read it because she loved it and knew I would like it because of my love for the vampire chronicles. So i decided to give it a try and see it was any good, and obviously it turned out to be amazing.I don't need to go into any description of the story since there are many many other reviews with it and there is also the amazon summary. Once you open the book and start reading you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I am most definintely a fan of Stephanie Meyer now! Im a teenager but my mom stole it from me and read it too and she loved it! At first I was weary about reading it, just because it was a vampire romance novel and thats nothing close to what Im used to but Im so glad I gave it a chance because now its one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, entertaining and addictive","review":"I was unaware that this book was listed under young lit. Even after reading the entire book, I wouldn't have categorized Twilight in that category. This was a wonderful book. Ms. Myers' writing style is very free flowing and easy to follow. I was hooked from the start. The Cullen family was delivered in a such a vivid and detailed manner that the characters seemed realistic. Absolutly loved this book!!!!! Give it a chance before you snub it. I have already passed it along to my 58 year old mother. My 25 year old sister is next in line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"May be a good book but Kindle DRM sucks","review":"I give all Kindle books 1 star reviews because of Kindle DRM. The Amazon Kindle is a Swindle. Maybe you remember the PR nightmare Amazon had after the massive remote automatic deletion they did of George Orwell 1984 books this year (2009) and one student's lawsuit against them for causing not only his copy of the book on his Kindle to be deleted but his notes to also be lost. Whether it is a good book or not I recommend anyone liking this book to avoid the Kindle version and any other electronic versions with DRM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the books! Hate the collector's edition.","review":"I absolutely love the Twilight saga and so I wanted to get the collector's edition to replace my old paperback copy. I bought my copy from Barnes and Noble and sadly paid full price for this item. I don't see the big deal in it, I was expecting a much nicer edition. The slipcase and bookmark is the only nice things about it. The cover has just an ugly sticker of the twilight cover on it, nothing fancy. And the chapter artwork is just the exact same red design on each chapter, again nothing all that exciting.I was very disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book was really disappointing. Not very good at all. It is definitely for teens or younger, so don't bother if you're over 16. The teen angst drove me insane and the writing was not up to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE BOOK... Not even 1 star rate","review":"A friend kept asking my daughter to read this book. She finally did and it has been a total night mare ever since. I can't believe that a \\"christian\\" mother would write these kind of books that play with the teens mind.My daughter changed completely after reading this book, she was being possesed by the characters and literally lived in the dark.I encourage any parent out there to be aware of these books.I'm sure the Mormon church is not too happy with this author when \\"Vampires\\" are satan driven.Right when teens are going thru a taugh time in their lives, this book sure make things worse. There should be books about encouraging them, not teach them to live in the dark..... very sad :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Suck on this","review":"By far the most naive, poorly written, over rated, garbage I've ever read. Words cannot begin to describe how sad it is that so many people find the romance between Bella and Edward to be \\"dreamy,\\" when in truth Edward is nothing more then a stalker. If your some one who thinks some one breaking into your house to watch you sleep sleep is anything but creepy, you're deaths will serve to decrees the surplus population."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"This is a romance novel? Oh. I thought it was a romantic comedy.I certaintly laughed a lot when I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slow Start to a Good Series","review":"There's a little more high school and a little less history and philosophy in this book than I'd prefer, but it is an engaging story. Bella, an ordinary, regular teenage girl from Arizona, moves to rainy Forks, Oregon, and there meets Edward, a Dominant, brooding extremely good-looking vampire. Bella comes to love him with her whole heart and soul, and Edward confesses to her that he's afraid he finds her so delectable that he may not be able to control himself around her. Any allegories to sex are completely intentional, so you can see why so many women love this series of books.The vampires in Edward's \\"family\\" of choice are almost *too* good and pure, and the family love-fest scenes started to make me sleepy. Luckily some villains show up and the end is more exciting.\\"Twilight\\" could have been a formulaic romance, and it's not, for which I am thankful. It's worth reading, if for no other reason than to get to the next book, \\"New Moon.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks","review":"This book stunk if you want a good read read harry potter katniss or eragon. not a cheezy vampire and wolf story"},{"rating":"1","title":"not deserving","review":"The beginning was good. It was mysterious and interesting but then after a while it became Edward this and Edward that and stars and bull. I got completely bored. I had to really force myself to finish reading this book. It did pick up again but ended so quickly I was unable to enjoy the action. The author had a good idea she just couldn't execute it well. It's written poorly and it doesn't deserve this huge credit, praise, and success."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Gigli of books","review":"Worst book I've had the displeasure of reading. Went in rather open minded, came out able to insult twilight as much as I want. They give no negative to being a vampire.Being a vampire is the single best thing ever with no repercussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read many times","review":"I'm one of those who totally adores Twilight. I've read the books several times and have watched all of the movies. Meyers creates a great world and I think it is great for people of all ages to enjoy! I would start with the books first and then maybe do a marathon of the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story, but overrated","review":"I applaud the author on her success, but I was not won over by the storyline. It was ho hum - I admit, it is not my style, although I do have a love for traditional or literary horror. I just feel this is a bit overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly gripping!","review":"This book is fantastic! And it is not just for young readers. I was 21 when I first got hooked.The characters and well developed, the plot is tremulous and fast paced and the writing is smooth and easy to read.For all you ladies out there with a taste for danger, Edward Cullen presents the ultimate forbidden fruit. A dangerous creature who falls madly for his prey. A demon who seeks to better himself though sacrifice and discipline. Edward is perfection on every page.Stephanie Meyer has created a true phenomenon in writing this book and I think if anyone reads past the third chapter they will at least appreciate her talent, if not find themselves bound to the dramatic saga she has composed.If you are looking for Action, Romance, Fantasy, and humor all rolled up into one nice neat 300 odd page novel, Twilight is your answer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"I really didn't think it was possible for another author to create such an exhilirating and spell-bounding story after \\"Harry Potter.\\" I was totally wrong!! I fell for this book hard, and I fell for Edward even harder. Stephenie created such dimensional characters that I could not, and would not put this book down! The experiences that Bella has are so amazingly beautiful. This book was so well written with such detail. I coudl picture every scene in my head like it was a movie, which it will be soon enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Never Ceases To Amaze Us All","review":"I think that, no matter how many times you've read it, Twilight will always stick something that you've forgotten about it in your head. Every time you read it, it's a different experience. It has tons of literary genres all packed into one book; romance, drama, mystery, action; you name it! I would recommend Twilight to anyone, anywhere, at any time. It will always be the first thing that pops into my head when someone says 'favorited book.'I know some people say 'vampires? you've got to be kidding.' Okay, make that most people, before they've read the book. Stephenie Meyer does such an exceptional job making it all believable. No, more than that, she makes it REAL. Sometimes I feel like there really is an Edward Cullen, a Bella Swan, a Jacob Black. And we all find ourselves wishing that there really was.I will always love this book, and it will always be my favorite along with the other three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"I received this book promptly and in excellent condition. I have read this book at least four times now, and still love it as much as I did the first time I read it! This is a wonderful book that I do recommend to my family and friends! Beautifully written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"This really is one of the best books I've ever read! Everyone needs to read it. It's AWESOME! I can't wait to see how the movie turns out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meyer is no Rowling","review":"I read this series to keep up with the pre-teen and teen girls in my neighborhood. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. These read like they were written by a 12-year-old. Meyer is no J.K. Rowling, that's for sure. You can blast through one of these puppies in a couple of hours. Meyers seems to make up unnecessary characters when she runs short on creativity (i.e. if 5 vampires are good, then 30 will be better). This is especially true in the last book. And book #3 was pretty useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio book","review":"I wanted to share my thoughts as to the quality of the audio production of Twilight. The books were amazing, but I found the audio book severely lacking. There was very little emotion put into the reading of this story. I would not recommend anyone buy this. You can find more in your own imagination. I enjoy audio books and I do hope that it will be redone in a manor that will capture the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommend","review":"I was hesitant to read thinking it was for tween girls. I was hooked immediately. All four books were excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read, I found I couldn't put it down!","review":"Ok so I have heard all the hype on this book so I bought the first one. I opened the book and read. this book is so easy to read and you get caught up in what is going on. You keep waiting for some big action but it never seems to happen. inspite of that the book was good. Good enough that my husband had to pick it up and read it. I have bought all the rest of the books and yes we have read all of them. We have looked forward to each book. The books are worth reading an you will be amazed at how fast the time will fly. Perfect to get a young person intrested in reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles is a real vampire series.","review":"This Twilight series makes me want to puke when I know that the de facto vampire series has already been written by Anne Rice. Are you Twilight fans aware of The Vampire Chronicles? Twilight is akin to Fabio novels for teenie boppers. If you are at all interested in reading the best vampire series that has and more than likely will ever be written, stop wasting your time w/this fluff and check out The Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What I expected...","review":"To put it straight, this was a horible book, and was exactly what I expected. The reason for this is mainly because of the writing style and the plot. the writing style made the book very hard to visualize. I can normally read a page in about 15 to 40 seconds but this book brought it up to 40 to 100 because of lousy visualizing. Please...end...this...tourture...! Secondly, the only thing that SM actually described was how beutiful that vampire guy was. I actually forgot his name! Oh, and the plot was garbage too. Sereously, who wants to hear about some teenagers love affair with a vampire who is trying to protect her from other killer/evil/rapist vampires. And the only people in my grade were the girls in my class with the lowest grades and one perverted boy I know. If you want a good book read the Inehertance Cycle by Christofer Paoloni.PS...excuse my bad spelling"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bordering on the verge of a cheesy romance novel.","review":"I read the book Twilight, after my cousins repeatedly raved to me how great it was, and I was more inclined to read it after hearing that it would be adapted to the big screen later this year. I thought, it must be good, right? First, to put it bluntly, the storyline passed dreadfully slow. There were so many chapters with really nothing pertaining to the plot that could have been easily edited out. And, the protagonist's thoughts about her godlike crush were mentioned too many times. I'm sorry, but I was wrong thinking this would be good, just since it was being turned into a movie. I mean, remember Eragon?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"After reading it, it's clear the plot of this book is a rip-off of LJ Smith's The Vampire Diaries, an older, and much better written series.Seems originality in literature is dead these days"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOL Fun for the whole family!","review":"You know, if your family are all the victims of head trauma. Or in a home for the criminally delusional.This is the funniest thing I've read in a long time. And thank goodness Ms. Meyer is encouraging young girls to develop relationships with abusive jerks who withold sexy-time as another means of controlling them into a freaky spiral of obsession!AND. I guess this means a few more years of the tiresome goth movement. I get it -- you're sad and you like bats.Oh, go play in an old fridge. Take Bella with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quote the Bible, only to Fall for the Devil?","review":"Meyer has listed this as the Twilight Saga. Yet, as a stickler for words (and based on the character of Bella), I can't help but have the impression that this book is more romance and chick lit than a long story of heroic achievement. A heroine is someone who saves the day; save us from chaos, as opposed to collaborating with it for her own selfish, boy-crush needs.The other definition of a saga is: a long, involved story, account, or series of incidents. This secondary definition applies. The tension is palpable in Twilight. Bella and Edward, though tediously, go back and forth (as teenagers do) in their \\"saga\\" for forbidden love. Not much action but if you love romantic drama, get this book.

It's all about \\"his gleaming eyes,\\" \\"his crooked smile,\\" and on and on. Don't expect any logic, either. The main character is a girl who has moved from her old school,where she never had a boyfriend, to a new school, where the guys can't leave her alone. And the logic goes downhill from there. But hey, since when did pre-adolescents need their fiction to make sense? If you're an adult, don't waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"This book combines all of the elements of a disastrous fanfic into one. You have the Mary Sue with the ridiculous name whom all the boys worship and adore, the ~angelic~ hero whose stunning good looks should more than make up for his misogynistic personality, a plethora of recycled adjectives and adverbs, and a handful of vampires for good measure. To compare the Twilight series to Harry Potter, or basically any series with a decent plot and characters that one can actually relate to, is a humongous insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice read","review":"I really enjoyed this book and will contine to read the rest in the series.

Sure it is light reading but there is just something I loved about the characters and story.If you are skeptical I say give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love story was great... Author, not so much","review":"I was really obsessed with Bella and Edward. I actually finished all 4 books in 14 days. I couldn't put them down because I couldn't wait to find out what happens to the two of them. I just think that plot could have been better. I don't get the Jacob thing. It makes me think that Stephenie Meyer has hang ups on an ex-boyfriend or something. COME ON! It was too much.What I can say is that the story of Edward and Bella is uncommon that you feel for them. However, I wish she wrote this with another author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story","review":"I have to say I had my doubts. I had heard from several people that this was a good series to read. I had also heard that they couldn't believe they were reading this type of books. So curiosity got the best of me. I borrowed this book from my sister.The way Twilight is written, it had me there. I felt like I was there watching everything, I was a part of it. The story reminds me of a young love, a love you don;t want to end. There is that person, no matter how bad they think they are you for you, you know that there is good inside. You long for that persons every touch, glance and just the sound of their voice. It reminds me of someone I once knew.I have to say I can not wait to start the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to vampire lore?","review":"I am a huge fan of vampire stories. I'm open for some liberty with vampire lore, but this one takes the cake. This story is primarily about vampires, it's about vampire families, and about what happens to them. However, why have a vampire story when you eliminate all the primary things that make a vampire a vampire? The story drags until about the last third of the book. I also doubt that an 80+ year old vampire would find a young, 17 year old, barely understanding who she is attractive? She is only slightly appealing as a character, and I guess just not worth getting too involved in. I wonder how the movie adaptation is going to try and make up for the sorely lacking story line and lore?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Wow! This is the best novel I've ever read. I've already read it 3 times, each time it was immpossible to put down. I've read the sequel twice and couldn't put it down either. Stephenie Meyer is definately my favorite author and this is definately my favorite novel. I find myself making connections to it, especially when watching a vampire movie or reading another vampire book. I now compare every other vampire story to this novel and conclude that it's the best I've heard. It's a great novel. I highly reccomend it. Everytime I read it I talk about it.

I now join the many 30-something mom's in being a huge fan.-I'd highly suggest getting them on audio to allow you to listen AND go about life.

Now i am not saying that if you are not a young adult you cannot read this book. But when you produce bad reviews it is not cool because you don't understand the current teen mind.

If it looks like a three year old lile girl just dumped a bucket of glitter over your head, how in the word are you supposed to look like a deadly killer vampire?The only reason read this book is because I was forced to watch the movie. I figured that if the movie sucked that bad, the book would be amazing, 'cause usually, the worse the movie is, the better the book is. I was mistaken on so many levels. The book was even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed; but not with Twilight","review":"I was expecting to receive a new book with the original Twilight cover as shown. What I got was a used book with the Twilight movie cover. I purchased this book believing that I would get the item in the picture. I did not. I am very disappointed in the sellers choice of advertisement. I would think that new means unused and that the product would look like the picture in the advertisement. In the future, this seller should be honest in advertising. For example, like-new is not new and show the actual item that you are selling. I will not purchase from this seller again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Time","review":"Wow, I am still shocked by the poor writing skills evident in this book. I guess if you like fantasy romance it kind of fit the category but there are so many better written books available why waste your time on this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped","review":"Read the whole 544 page novel, and liked about 50 pages worth of scenes. I thought the vampire baseball idea was excellent, but Bella bored me. Meyer had a few inspired metaphors, like the glittery vampire, and 'Twilight' -- the 'perfect romance' because all good days must end. On the other hand, the book contained so much fluff and tedium that wading through the high school emoting just to hit the highlights was a draining experience. Also found Edward on the 'stalker' side.I would not recommend this novel, unless you enjoy high school romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good...","review":"Again, I guess I'm really late to the Twilight party, but I had to see what all the fuss was about. Again, I give it the star rating then start to think about it and wonder if I've been to generous... What did I like? The werewolf story line - for me - worked very well. The dark secret of the tribe at La Push, the gang, the growing up of Jacob Black, the sinister description of his the other possible 'gang members.'But the other stuff: Edward's absence sends Bella into a loop of emotion that I found it really hard to empathise with. She's freezing cold all the time, she curls herself up into a ball, all the time, and this goes on and on and on and on and on.I think thats my principle problem withthe story. Too long.And yet again, the constant references to Edward, Rosalie, and the rest all being impossibly beautiful, astonishing, etc etc. Why aren't they ever a bit geeky or whatever?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan of Buffy, Not Bella!!!!!!","review":"Bella is annoying, selfish and not a good role model for girls. I'm not sure why she is so helpless and needy, but she is... and unnecessarily so! I like the NA theme and read 3 of the 4 books as a screening process for my kids, but I will have to discuss what a strong and healthy lead character should look like and why the sudden infatuation with a boy without much thought is common among teenagers, but in the long run it is not healthy.I wish Stephenie Meyer would have wrote a strong lead female character, but I'm not sure if it's the strong patriarchy stressed in the LDS religion that influenced her character development of a helpless needy girl that needs the strength of men to protect her or what. But it isn't the best book I've ever read, but I enjoy the NA theme and the discussions about selfishness, independence, and healthy relationships that I can have with my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing series","review":"I have read all 4 books in this series and I would not recommend them to anyone. I am 36 yrs old and this series is for the young adult crowd so maybe I am too old to enjoy it. I found the main character Bella so annoying I had a hard time reading the books. The story took a strange direction in the last book (I thought way too out there for teens). I read the books because I saw a preview for the Twilight movie which I hope is not as bad as the books. I recommend checking them out from your local library before you waste your money. Just a side note- this is the only time I have ever written a review about books or anything, that is how bad I thought the books were."},{"rating":"1","title":"When you put together a bad plot and terrible writing, you get Twilight.","review":"Twilight is by far the most overrated story ever concocted. The story in itself is horrendous. At my school, we have a little skit that sums up almost the entire series. It goes like this:Bella: Edward I love you!Edward: No Im too dangerous!Bella: Edward I love you!Edward: No Im too dangerous!...THIS IS NOT A GOOD STORY. Also the book portrays Edward as perfect in some parts, but COME ON HE IS A VAMPIRE HE HAS PROBLEMS. So yeah now I shall rant on the writing.The writing of this book is absolutely terrible, its uneven sloppy and at times capricious. I could barely stomach parts of the first book, and Id occaisionally read parts of the third book over a friends shoulder. All I saw while doing this were a bunch of small, cheesy words, and one long one that completely shatters what flow the book had.Therefore, the reason this book is popular is a complete and utter mystery to me. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hermione, Where Are You?","review":"Hermione, where are you when we need you??!! Hermione THINKS! She ANALYZES! She is NOT VAPID. Bella does not think, does not analyze and is as vapid as any hero comes. She swoons. She repeats words over and over, mainly the word \\"perfect.\\" She is self-centered, allows herself to be manipulated, allows herself to be treated as prey (food), and doesn't have the brains (seriously: she doesn't) to realize when she is in danger. And that's just character and plot: as far as writing is concerned, this book seems to have been written by somebody who doesn't really care about writing at all. Weak verbs, limp sentences, banal descriptions. This book, by a woman, presents unhealthy role models for young girls. For anybody who reads it, actually. I agree with the reviewer who weeps for literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashamed to have read this junk","review":"I'm ashamed to admit that I have in fact read all four books. Hey, it was summer, and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. After blazing through them, I came to this conclusion. This book reads entirely too fast to actually be able to process what you're reading. When the whirlwind of vampire drama was over I felt... gross, as though I'd been on a candy binge. Because that is what these books are! Candy. It's like Halloween candy when you want to eat it ALL, and your wise parents say, \\"Not too much at once, you'll get sick.\\" And that's exactly what happens to the fans of this book. They are on an incredible high from ingesting too much of something that seems so sweet, but will just hurt them in the end.The books are ridiculous from beginning to end. I need substance in my reading material. I'm going to go re-read Moby Dick now to repair my brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"how did this book get published?","review":"Goodness...this book deserves less than one star. How in the world did it get published? Why is it so popular? Vampires don't sparkle! And that interview says she hasn't even read Bram Stoker's Dracula!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN CLOSE TO THE MAGNITUDE OF HARRY POTTER!","review":"I'm sorry I have to give such a bad review, but that is seriously it. This whole series is intended for Jr. High & High school girls who are all sex craved for Edward Cullen and seeing Taylor Lautner shirtless! IT's really dumb and boring.I must admit that Stephanie Meyer has a lot of good talent and her writing reflects that, but i'm sorry, this series does not deserve recognition. It just pisses me off to see Twilight fans argue that this book is better than Harry Potter.....HA! It NEVER WILL! Harry Potter is legend! The world will soon forget this series....not long after the last movie....i'm sorry, but it's the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was pushed into reading these books by a friend absolutely obsessed with them. So I finally bought the first book and it took me two weeks to read. That is saying a lot about the lack of excitement in its content considering I read A Game of Thrones in 2 days.Now, I read a lot of guilty pleasure books and this one was not even that. I could not get wrapped up in the characters or the plot (or lack thereof) as nothing seemed to suspend my belief. Not only that but there were editing errors that pulled me out of the realm the author had built immediately.I don't know if anyone else noticed this but she said she read \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and the idea of vampires having shimmering skin comes off the first or second page of that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This is a vapid rip-off of Romeo & Juliet with vampires. Vampires are supposed to burn in daylight, not twinkle. I won't bother with more in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this product","review":"I was not happy with a few of the cd tracks that was not able tobe heard. I had to miss a part of the story. Other than that the storywas great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read but at times hard to stomach","review":"I enjoyed this book very much. I liked the story and I love books about vampires and the supernatural. I say it's a bit hard to stomach because some of the dialogue was a bit cheesy and made me laugh or throw up my hands and think that no one in his/her right mind would say that! The only way I could get through those moments was to think of when I was 17, and how I would have reacted to the book. I must admit if I read this when I was younger I would have loved every single line, so it's obvious why younger readers would react so positively towards it. Despite my disbelief in some of the dialogue this book was a page-turner and highly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining read","review":"Very easy to read - a really entertaining novel that contains romance cleverly mixed with teen angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is great, audio book is AWFUL","review":"I really enjoyed reading the Twilight books, but the audio books are scratch-your-ears-out awful. This is NOT a professionally narrated audio book in which the talented reader is able to portray each character's voice as you imagine them in your head. This is like a bored librarian reading to a group of fifth graders with absolutely NO difference between the \\"voice\\" of Bella and the \\"voice\\" of Edward or anyone else for that matter. I was so disappointed because I was hoping to listen to them all while I painted a few rooms in my house and I couldn't even get through the first chapter. Don't waste your money on this, you will be disappointed unless you don't care that it's poorly done and just want to hear the story. I highly recommend reading them rather than listening to these audio books, otherwise you will not get the same enjoyment out of the story or understand how well they are written."},{"rating":"2","title":"twilight","review":"This is an awesome book and arrived right on time in perfect condition.

You will be hooked and have to read the second, third, and forth soon after!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I have to say that I'm rarely annoyed by stories. This was one annoying book. I hate when characters fall in love too quickly for no reason. I hate both main characters. Bella is annoying. Edward is creepy.

It held my interest throughout, and I\\" am looking forward to reading \\"New Moon\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I loved it, and am now addicted. I will continue reading the series and hope the rest of the books are just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the book","review":"I loved the book! I usually don't read but I liked this one enough to buy and read the rest of them in one week. It has so much more detail then the movie. I really liked Midnight Sun too. I hope Stephenie will finish that one for us soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big print is a plus in paperback","review":"Haven't gotten too far in the novel yet, but I was plesantly surprised the type was large enough for me (62) to read without difficulty. And at under $7.00, the paperback is a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Although, the first book is full of good epicure and the occasional metaphor, all the hype about this book is not worth it. You will feel your eyes glaze over for the detailed oh-pity-me scenes, and although there are endless descriptions of Edward, it is a decent novel. Although I thoroughly enjoy the first book, the second is not worth a minute of your time. The ultimate snoozer,as dull as dull can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"Twilight is the first book in the Twilight Saga. Everyone has been entralled about this series so I figured I should read it. You either like vampires or not. It is about a teenager so it is probably more appealing to the younger generation unless you are an older person who likes to go back to your younger years. It is about love but it is also about suspenseful lust. It also slightly portrays that it is all right for a boy to treat a girl rather rudely and that she will still like him...which I didn't like. It's what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"twilight rocks your socks. oh yah","review":"twilight is a great love story.so all i have to say is move over harry poter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"This is a wonderful storythat is full of romance and suspense. I read it because my grandaughter was reading it and I wanted to make sure that it was not harmful to her. I did not find anything offensive. In fact it teaches lessons about loyalty to family, abstinence before marraige and abortion. I devoured the other three books and have been recommending the series to friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never received my purchase","review":"Frankly, there really is nothing to review. I have not received my purchase. I have emailed the seller who claimed on August 12 she would expedite another one, and still have not received that as of August 21. Now, why would you automatically say you would send another one before you even attempt to track the first one you claimed to have sent, unless you've never sent it. This has been the worst service I've ever had with Amazon. It took me awhile to even begin purchasing anything from Amazon for this very reason, and definitely is the reason I will be hesitant to purchase anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for one read","review":"I'm re-reading this for its comic value. Just got to the part where Bella talks about how stupid she is. I'm not going to argue with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down; Left Me Wanting More","review":"All around, Twilight was a fantastic read. Every time I turned the page, the story became deeper, more mesmerizing. I fell in love with the characters and the idea of love with which the whole story is saturated. Mrs. Meyer did an amazing job bringing such an unbelievable storyline to life in a way that makes it completely believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight is Stupid","review":"The whole thing is really just ridiculous. Bella, the lead, is an angsty, whiny mary sue. Edward is an abusive jerk. The story smacks of bad writting, horrid overtones, and massive plot chasms. In short this book should not be seen as a paragon of literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glisten - really?","review":"I am a blade fan. I strongly feel that vampires should explode in sunlight. I also feel that by taking away that weakness, you elevate vampires to a demi-god status.This is a romance set in a vampire backdrop. I didn't care for the romance style. Please don't hate me, Twilight fans. This is just an honest opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"twilight review","review":"Twilight the book is not a great book in my opinion. Thankfully I tried one more the next book in the series and it got better and I now am finishing up the rest.This book in the series is extremely childish and for a more seasoned reader it would probably be a complete bore.This is the perfect book for a teenager I guess, but I dont remember being that silly back then!Anyways, if you buy make sure to go ahead and try the second book - I like it alot better the heroine doesnt act so annoying and the hero is alot better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't care for it one bit","review":"As so many others I was eager to read this book, due to the big hype around it and its sequels. However this is just rubbish, and when I have a daughter I will not encourage her to read it. The heroine is so accident prone that she should live in a mental institution where all the cushioning will keep her safe. Then there is Edward, the vampire she loves. Though he sounds very dreamy he is just plain dumb. If I were a vampire I wouldn't reveal my secret after a month with the looney chick after keeping the secret for nearly a hundred years. All the laughing and questions are annoying, along with the remaining family of vampires accepting her with open arms, as if she were one of them instead of an appetizer as she should be. People out there, please don't give this book a minute of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can sum it up neatly","review":"Twlight is like reading a fanfiction.Lovers of Mary-Sues who don't like to think too hard will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foot in my mouth!","review":"I made fun of all my friends for liking the movies. They just seem so cheezy and high school-ish. My friends and I are grown women in our late 20s and early 30s so I never understood the obession with these movies............until I finally read the books. Wow was I blown away and I finallly \\"get it\\". This book is awesome. I've never been a reader but I breezed through the 1st two books in a matter of a few weeks and that's because I'm a mother of 2 toddlers! It is so easy to escape into these books regardless of your surroundings. So I had to discipline myself not to read while with my kids! lol! I only read at night after putting my kids down. These books became my Mommy time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite book series","review":"The 8th time I have read this series in 4 years, started reading on a whim the last time I was deployed without ever hearing about the books or movie.

Thanks Stephanie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe I even made it all the way through","review":"I was just hoping it would get better, but it did not. I can't believe that such poorly written rubbish became such a hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"150x better then the movie","review":"I personally had never heard of this book series until the 1st movie was released. My husband and I rented the movie and decided it was alittle lifeless and boring for our taste. So I never thought the book would be any good until recently when a close friend asked me if I ever read the series and then after explaining that I wasn't thrilled about the movie she convinced me that the book was 10 times better. Already skeptical I purchased the book via kindle and got hooked. Since finishing the 1st book I've re-watched the 4 current twilight movies (barrowed from friend) and started reading the 2nd book. What the movies lack are the attention to little but important details that the books capture, I will probably watch Breaking Dawn part 2 when it's released on dvd (and when friend buys it) just because I've seen the others but I will definately finish the book series that's well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must have better things to do with your time","review":"I had a suspicion, almost from the first page that I was reading rubbish but as you can see I have been kind and granted this novel 2 stars as the writing in places is just passable.I bought the book on the strength of the blurb on the back (when will I learn) - \\"An Amazon Best Book of the Decade... so Far\\". Shame on you Amazon. Anyway, I actually have just arrived at page 110 and don't intend to go further; I have better things to do with my time.Why this decision; well I checked out those \\"suspicions\\" on Amazon and when the one star reviews are written better than the five star reviews, then that's the time to give up.However, I can understand that this novel might have some appeal for less demanding readers, after all it's not as ghastly as Tuesday with Morrie, which was also a best seller and also reflects on the public's appalling lack of literary taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"It reminds me of any other teen love story i have ever read. Nothing different except vampires which does not save the story. I can understand why people love this but its just not for me.

I kept putting my book down and occupying myself with something less boring instead. It was with some relief that I turned the last mind numbingly dull page.Pluses? I can't think of any. The plot is highly derivative, in a world that has seen rather too much of Buffy the Vampire slayer and Angel (both of which are far more entertaining than this book). It is overwritten, with page after endless page of winging about the weather or some such pass time. There is little real connection between the characters nor any good reason why they should act how they act. When we get a bit of action, it is near the end of the book - but a point in the story that should probably have been near the end of chapter 1 in an interesting work.Some people like this book enough to buy the sequel. In my experience, these people are 12 year old girls. I presume they like it because it is their first real experience of a vampire tale. I doubt anyone else will be interested"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"It is amazing the way the that the book involves you. I couldn't stop reading it.

Fine. I am a sap. I did enjoy this book, and have read it twice. But NO WAY is this better than Harry Potter, or even as good as. Potter is an epic struggle between good and evil, whereas this is a love story. A well-written one, I'll admit, but most of the struggle between \\"good\\" and \\"evil\\" wouldn't have happened if Bella and Edward had never met.Bella's constant descriptions of Edward's good looks get irritating. And the grammatical errors! So distracting!Plus, Bella's view of herself is irrational. She thinks she's boring, while simultaneously FIVE guys like her! She needs to get a grip.A word to parents: I wouldn't let your kid read this till he or she is in high school, because they'll get addicted and want to read the others in a hurry. The first two are fine for whoever can handle a long read, but the last two have some mild issues that I'm glad I didn't read until now. (I'm in high school.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"Have to agree with the others....the book goes on and on page after page of the same ol thing.

Don't think I'll waste my money on the rest of the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Well I'm not much of a reader. I haven't read a book in over 4 years until Twilight.

I just want it to be done with. I knew it was young adult fiction. But, there was so much hype with the movie and the series of books that I thought I would read the first one. It's just not well written and very predictable.Moreover, the characters leave a lot to be desired. There is a mother who reviewed the book stating that she was concerned about young girls reading and falling in love with an overbearing, controlling man rather than a vampire. I agree with her review. I had the same thoughts about the male in this book. I would not want my daughter reading this as a love story.I would not recommend this book to any woman - young or old. I am truly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Stephenie Meyer's writing drew me into every word as Edward and Bella were drawn together.

I sincerly hope parents of young teenage girls read this and talk with thier daughters about how far from reality Bella's relationships are. This caracter is probably the stupidest girl i have read about in a long time. We all get upset after a break-up but lets get real. This girl has made ever one around her misserable and she could care less. Giving ultimatums to her fater, using Jackob, dumping her friends and the list goes on with many stupid things. I just want to reach in to this book and strangle the little twit. Dont get me started on Edward, com on \\"you cant go see Jackob, he is dangereous\\". How many times has he told Bella I might kill you? What makes him better for her then, at least Jackob has real feeling for her. Needless to say I disscourage any young women from reading thies series, it should have came out in the adult section for this girls stupidy alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"This book is not a good work by any means. It starts out well, but turns into a soggy teenage romance and never goes back. Very bad work.

In fact, I'm a little embarassed to be familiar with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"aweful poorly written book","review":"Bad Bad Bad. No meat to the story, just skip the book all together. Let's say the most interesting part of the book was the cover graphics and that says it all... For the life of me, I just can't see how this book could've been New York Times Best Seller. Common, America!! The author really doesn't know how to write PERIOD. Even I could've written more imaginative vampire story with better pros. jees.. Everything is super-contrived and stretched out to make a mere 50 pg story into 500 pg instead. Enough of Edward being beautiful!! We get it!! Nothing really happens in this book, extremely boring and pretentious. I bet the movie will be much more interesting and hopefully get to the point fast! Just get a cliffnote version of the book, and save your dollars during this economic hardship."},{"rating":"2","title":"more Bella and Edward","review":"Yes, Bella and Edward's story sucks you in. I love it and I lend my copy to everyone. It's addicting and leaves you craving more. You can find a bit more by visiting Stephenie Meyer's website for outtakes from both books.

It's a whole new perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a book that I couldn't put down!","review":"I am an avid reader and I have been very disappointed in the recent selection of books out there...until now.

I don't think that I can adequately tell you what an impact these stories have had on me and my reading list. How can anything be more purely romantic, tender, sensual...? How could anything be more unique, original...? I have to admit falling inlove with all the characters and waiting with great anticipation for the next installment--in fact, ANYTHING by such a fresh and unique voice as Stehenie's! I wish to thank her for sharing her dreams with us and I am forced to express my astonishment that anyone could find this story anything less than beautiful! In case anyone wonders: I am a 34 year old Science teacher with an extremely active imagination! :-) Thank you again, Stephenie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a book for Teens and it shows.","review":"I'm a 46 year old woman who was advised to read the 4 Vampire books by Stephanie Meyers, by my sister and two work friends. I am now on the second book and I must say that they are by no means anywhere near as good as Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. However, I take into consideration that these books are written for a much younger demographic (although, so was Harry Potter and I enjoyed those books immensly!). Nevertheless, I'm determined to finish reading all four books. I read for pleasure, so who cares if the books are juvenile romatic cheese-balls -- it's strictly escapist reading anyway. (P. S. If you enjoy morbid humor, try reading Christopher Moore's \\"YOU SUCK\\" and \\"BLOOD SUCKING FIENDS\\" -- both are also about vampires and absolutely hilarious!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"You weirdos taking five pages to rant are missing the fun. I'm a 23 yr old male with an MA in Lit/Creative Writing and even I liked it. Despite the overused verbage (there is, admittedly, lots of grimacing, glaring, and cringing) and the relatively slow start, the book is fun. I can't remember the last time I got through 500 pages in a few days. Meyer needs time to come into her own style and the plot has some kinks that need ironing, but the story and characters are sound and relatable. What Meyer does the best, however, is tap into romantic feeling (it could even be said there is as much romantic suspense as there is action suspence) via a normal character in an exceedingly extraordinary situation. This is why people like it. Take a chill pill, relax, remember what it felt like the first time you fell in love (or saw a vampire) and enjoy it. I know that's hard for some of you erudite ninnies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I am a high school teacher who noticed many of the students were reading this book so I decided to give it it a shot. I am a huge Buffy the Vampire Slayer fan so I was intrigued. It wasn't easy getting the book from the school library b/c it was always checked out but I finally I had some luck. I didn't touch it for 2 weeks but when I finally sat down to read it, I fell in love with all the characters. I finshed the book in 2 days and finished the 2 sequels 2 days later.

This book not only makes me feel younger but it made me thirsty (pun intended) for more. I bought the series and finished the 4 books in 5 days! Not only that, I read the 5th book online which is Twilight but from Edward's prospective. I also just held a woman's movie night at my house and you guessed it...Twilight was the feature.This short series is a very fast read (intended for a younger audience) but none-the-less fantastic.So, if you are like me, take the time to read it.

And Ms. Meyers DID sit down and write it, and even got it sold, THAT is something to be applauded and if other writers follow their dream and put their products out there, that can't be a bad thing.One-dimensional was a good description, neither Bella nor Edward were particularly interesting. It was pre-teen adolescent puppy-love and written as such. I won't be picking up any of the sequels, even after reading the teaser. I prefer sugar to saccharine.Have you ever eaten tripe?

I found that I could really relate to almost all of the characters. They all seemed very real, and I felt I had known them for years after finishing the book.

I thought that this book was good to some extent but it would have been better if it was written in a higher reading level.

It also seems that the boys in that town where rather desperate to get a girlfriend or Bella is perfect which is doubtful considering she can't last a day withoout causing trouble.

Well, in this case...a lot of people CAN do better than Twilight. Yes..everyone can write a better FANFIC!This is mediocre writing at best from a plot which has been use millions of times in previous paranormal romance novels. The only reason she was successful is because she managed to reach a group of young adults who normally never pick up a book unless forced by the school system. They virtually have no clue how to figure out if something is well written because for the first time they are readings something they enjoy (they could have picked up a lot other YA novels and enjoyed them).The characters are bland and the plot is nothing new.

From chapter one, I had to force myself to read it... only because I knew she'd want to discuss it and I hated to rain on her parade.The novel was rife with mistakes and seemed to drone on and on and on and on... you get the point. Bella is a whiny, primadona who only thinks of herself and seems to be depressed by things that would make most girls happy. Really? Really! Maybe I could have gotten into the novel a bit more if it wasn't for my extreme dislike of the main character. By the end of the book, I was actually rooting for James to kill her whiny ass!

A teenage girl (that really resembles a 7-year-old) falls in love with a vampire, which is the most overused plotline there is. How many books start with this type of introduction, I moved to a small town in the middle of nowhere? All you have to do is read the back and know the whole story. Spoiler: a girl moves to a town in the middle of nowhere, falls for the incredibly \\"beautiful\\" loner boy with the mysterious air about him (Meyer seems to forget that no man on the face of the earth wants to be called beautiful). Of course he is the vampire, falls for her, reveals that he is a vegetarian vamp, only drinkning aniimals blood, becomes overly protective and kills a vampire that wants to drink her blood. Then theu all live happily ever after the end.

When I was done with the series, (I had a friend that begged me to read the whole series so we could have something to talk about, and she is a REALLY good friend), I felt like I had read a poorly written romance novel that took the reader farther than a \\"normal\\", \\"clean\\", \\"wholesome\\" book would take the reader in describing a physical relationship between two people but just short of where a real romance novel would have gone. I believe this book appeals to a group of young teenage girls who really long for the excitement of reading a true romance novel, and who would become addicted to the genre given the chance, but who haven't read romance novels because they are not quite \\"bad\\" enough to do so.

I think that was the author's point. In the beginning of the book Bella points out that, \\" if she looked like a girl from Phoenix should, she could have worked it to her advantage. But physically, I'd never fit in anywhere. I should be tan, sporty, blond, - a volleyball player, or a cheerleader perhaps- all the things that go with living in the valley of the sun.\\"The author meant to make her somewhat normal I think. I mean Bella did not expect to be crowded around every day with boys asking her if she wanted to go to a dance. She was NORMAL. And that was what made it special. She didn't epect to fall in love with a NON NORMAL person, a vampire.I think that's the point.

What's wrong with this girl?? And why is she so lovesick over a guy who is constantly 'smirking','chuckling', and 'snickering'???

The Twilight Saga is fantastic and I love it as do many of the other people I know who have read it. It really puts a fantasy-twist on vampire myths: they don't get incinerated by the sun but instead sparkle. They don't have to drink human blood but can also live on animal blood instead.

Cant people just accept a good book and not ruin it for all the sane humans who dont cry over how beautiful edward is. Also, the movies are TERRIBLE. I think I might still like twlight to this day if people didnt make it an obsession. Its like Uggs. I loved them because I was one of the first to get them in my school and they were comfortable.

Its popularity says more about the quality of contemporary readership than about the quality of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagine reading the diary of a shallow 15 year old girl.","review":"I wanted to like this because I'm a huge Harry Potter fan and heard this was supposed to be as engaging, but it was way too much like a soap opera for me: Yes, there is a difference between drama and a soap opera and if you don't understand why you won't get anything out of my review.I couldn't help but think of All My Children on a teen scale when I read it. The pacing and depth of story was about what you would get from reading the diary of a somewhat shallow 15 year old girl. I probably would have liked this in my teen years, but I'm 47 now and it was actually painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see the appeal!","review":"I couldn't even finish this book I found it so predictable and boring. There were no new ideas (beautiful tortured lonely \\"monster\\" falls in love with pretty, misunderstood girl) and no action to speak of. I really can't understand why this series is so popular!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what!?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"Seriously, I dont get what the horny hype is for this book? Why do people like it so much? It's soooooooooooo bad; the writing is terrible, the story is terrible, the characters are undeveloped and flat--ZERO PERSONALITY. How in the world did it get published? Somehow NOTHING HAPPENS, but every single detail is described ad nauseum down to people's underwear--who cares get to the freaking point. The only reason people are rushing through this book is because nothing happens so they have to keep reading to see if anything does. And I don't get why these two are suposed to be in love? Because Edward's so beautiful? UGHAGHAHGHAGHAG this book makes me so mad. I felt like I just read some 13 year old girl's fanfiction that she sat down in one night and cranked out without any regard. BAD BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please make it stop","review":"first of all we does edward have to be soo perfect? this book is very shallow nobody is that perfect yes i know its just fantasy but it gives people the idea that there will always be a guy there who will be so deeply in love with you that there won be any problems wrong and maybe there is a guy out there but it may give pople who havent been in love to expect someone as perfect as edward, atleast that was the vibe i got. second of all sense when do vampires shine in the sun seriuosythe positves it did have a great story line and she did do her best and many seem to like it but for this reader it was just sadlastly i think that people who are so obsesed and in love with anything twilight need to find a new book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, repetitive, repetitive...","review":"Wow, Edward is such a god, he's beautiful. He glistens in the sun, and his stare is SO intense. Blah, blah, blah. This book could've been a lot shorter if it didn't repeat the same stuff over and over.

I don't understand why this is such a craze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys steer clear, definitily one for the girls","review":"I'd heard great things about this book and was expecting something really different to what I got.I've sort of come to think of the book in 3rds. The first third deals with the introduction to the story and lays a few snippets of information. The second third of the book is basically 100 or so pages of Bella describing how beautiful Edward is and how they are both so intoxicated by each others smell. The last part of the book picks up and gets really interesting with possibly the worst closing to a book I've read. Without giving too much away, we hear about how great these vampires are throughout the book and in their moment to shine when the star is in dire peril....it's suddenly a week later....then when it's asked about what happened there's a 1 sentence answer. Biggest Anti-climax ever...Girls, you might like the mills&boon; style romance and pursuit of the perfect boy.Guys, steer clear, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"This book is AMAZING!

There was no need to think about a complex plot. These books are easy reads that appeal to young girls who typically don't read for fun. If the people who idolize the Twilight series were to read better literature the series would have less fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"additive","review":"The book is so additive that I never can put it down because I always want to know what will happen next.

It was an interesting development but I feel anything would have been welcome at that point.Pages and pages (and pages) of Bella gasping over Edward's beauty, Edward warning Bella he is dangerous (huh - not in the bedroom department he isn't)and a depressing teen angst storyline that had me thinking it would end in joint suicide.Edward was vampire 'lite'. He was intriguing but just needed to be a little more lively, sexy, powerful etc for my liking.Bella didn't get why Edward wanted her. Frankly, neither did I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible writing","review":"This series is very redundant (even within each book).

I loved the movie, but as usual, the book is even better. I do not have much time to read, but I listen to plenty of audio books in the car, the shower, and bed. This one was really hard to turn off.

On a plane ride I finally decided to read it- and I couldnt put it down...in four days i read Twilight and New moon.. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this book..its not just for teenagers- I am 21 years old.

In all of the books I have ever read, I have NEVER felt so emotionally connected to any characters before. I didn't want to finish the book because I didn't want the feelings I was having to end.

I really loved the fast paced, clean and easy to read aspects of this book. I'm just amazed that it has become a \\"love it\\" or \\"hate it\\" fixation!

We both ended up loving it so much we have seen the movie over 4 times at the theater and both ended up reading all 4 books. This book has enough romance to keep a woman happy and enough action to keep a man happy. I normally read Christian fiction and was happy that there is minimal curse words in all 4 books, so teens could read. As I believe this series was geared towards. There is violence, but it is not grafic or grotesque. You know what happens, but she doesnt go into bllod gorry details about it. I would HIGHLY recommend. This #3 & #4 are probably tied in my vote for the best of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"WoW!","review":"Personally, I wasn't expecting much thinking it would freak me out, but reading it anyway.

I recommend this almost everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everybody has been reading this book...","review":"I picked this book up after the movie had come out. I remember seeing people of all ages everywhere reading it and it was on every talk show. I remember at the time being thoroughly engrossed in the story. BUT it doesn't leave a lasting impression. If you asked me what happened in the first book I honestly wouldn't be able to give you many specific details. It's a good read you will finish quickly but it is forgettable. If you want to read of romance and paranormal pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!","review":"I was excited to get this book because previously, I just had Twilight in paperbook.

I'm so glad though that I did. This book made me fall in love with reading all over again. Twilight captured my attention and I can't get the words and characters from the book out of my head. It is such a great read, and left me wanting more. I'm now on the third book and I have a hard time putting it down, but yet I have had to make myself slow down because I don't want these books to end. I have fallen in love with Bella, Edward, and the Cullens and will feel as if I have lost friends when the series ends. I wish that there were going to be more! I hope with all my heart that the author will continue writing Midnight Sun (Edward's version of Twilight). I can't get enough of the Twilight Saga!

I had heard so much about this book from every girl I know so I decided to read it. I was annoyed with Bella. She is so weak and foolish and fragile. Edward just struck me as arrogant. I had a really hard time liking any of the characters. The story was seriously lacking in depth and I just really felt like the romance part of the book was a little creepy. I love vampires and vampire stories but this was such a let down. I would have liked to have seen a stronger character in Bella's place. Someone with a little more depth and humility in Edward's place and some real reason why they \\"love each other\\". Now we are going to have a ton of teenage girls thinking that this is love instead of learning how to stand up for themselves and finding depth in another person.

Although hardly an original premise, the huge success of this series shows how appealing the idea of forbidden love is, especially for young girls.I must confess I was just as caught up as everybody else while reading it. Yet overall I found it deeply unsatisfying. Twilight glorifies a kind of romantic love that is not only unrealistic but sets the stage for abuse.Literary speaking, Twilight is like a huge marshmallow: fluffy and sweet and addictive, yet hardly nutritious and, eaten in excess, bad for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"here's the wind-up, and here's the pitch.","review":"Nothing happens.

I'm not going to go real in- depth with this review. The book was not well written at all, but you do need to take into consideration the age range it's channeled towards. I might have liked it more if i was 12 or 13. I just thought it was too cheesy. Edward and Bella are both pretty pitiful, and majorly lacking in the personality department. The book was basically a lot of banter back and forth, and the ending was not even a tiny bit satisfying. The only reason why I gave this two stars was because I did make it all the way through the book.I kept waiting for something amazing to happen (don't ask me why). Lesson learned- no more teenage vampire romance novels for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much ado about nothing","review":"If sitting in a high school lunchroom observing teenagers - and in this instance, uninteresting, love-sick teenagers - talking to and gazing at one another is on your list of \\"things I want to do today all day long,\\" then you'll love this book.

Ideal for teens that look for romance and want to meet their perfect, handsome, intelligent, and respectful vampire.Incredible love story that has motivated millions of teens to start reading and get lost in the pages of books that make their imagination flow free.The Twilight fandom is like a family, if you like the books, the movies or both you are welcomed.The movies are not exactly like the books, so if you didn't liked the movies give it a shot to the books, once you start reading them you can't stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic Read !!","review":"I enjoyed the book thoroughly but I honestly wished that I had read the book before I saw the movie because I kept comparing the two and visualizing the screen characters while I read the book .

How is this popular? Bella is whiney and annoying, the shiny vampire thing was silly, and the pace of the book is so slow! Nothing ever happens!

My brother-in-law gave the first book to my sister for Christmas. In early January she told m I HAD to borrow it because it was so wonderful. While I was half way through the book I had my husband order all three form Amazon! As soon as they arrived I started the second book on a Friday evening and finished the third by Sunday afternoon. I just couldn't put it down! I have a hard time reading a book I can't get lost in, I either become obsessive or never get through the second chapter, this one defiantly fits the bill. I am anxiously awaiting the 4th book, as well as the Host.

The Twilight series is the only series i have ever read more than once...actually more than a few times. I absolutely LOVE this series! Stephenie Meyer has miraculously been able make the perfect combination of adventure, love, fantasy, and even comedy. Her writing style is totally unique, and sucks you in from beginning to end. It makes you feel like you are actually there -- you are Bella.Sometimes i find myself fidgetting -- too excited to wait for Breaking Dawn as patiently as i should be capable.All i can say is: Go Stephenie Meyer! You ROCK!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I miss Buffy","review":"This book was suggested to me by someone who was very taken with the series.I do not understand just where the appeal lies.The characters are tedious, the writing is bland, the attempts at humor miss the mark and the plot is neither cleverly crafted nor interesting.Fortunately there are no pesky hard words to stumble over.I can only assume this book was written to appeal to romantically inclined 11-13 year old girls who want to fantasize about being big girls in high school.It makes Buffy the Vampire Slayer seem like Shakespeare."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read.","review":"This book is part Harlequin Romance and part Horror story. Most of the characters are poorly developed, and the 2 main characters aren't really believable for a number of reasons. The storyline is weak. The book bored me, and I had a hard time getting through it. I can only guess that this book has been so popular because it has sexual undertones which I imagine are somewhat titillating to teenage girls. There are some underlying messages in this book which I find abhorrent. As a parent I would not want my teenage (or any age)daughter(or son)reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"XP Twilight","review":"A simplistic book. It seems to capture readers, as it did me, when they start reading the series. But once done with it, when you step back and look at it as a whole, you see it could have been a one hundred page book and not interfere with the plot at all. I find it a bad book, simply because of the repetition. But I do like it because it actually encourages young adults to read. Unfortunately, after reading this book, they seem to become obsessed with it, and don't look beyond it to the wider range of literature by more experienced authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for audiences over the age of 18!","review":"I was really interested in reading this after hearing many positive things about the author and series. I like vampire tales and hoped this would be like an edgy Harry Potter, with fangs. Sadly, I got a 12 year old girl's diary which read like a cheesy romance novel for the tween set. Almost nothing happened and the most action happened off page. Not good. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"The watery vampires","review":"Bella Swan hates leaving sunny Phoenix for rainy, gloomy forks, where her estranged and not so much beloved father lives. Yet she does it, for reasons never adequately cleared. Maybe she's a masochist. She's rather dull, but all the kids in town love her, save the scion of a vampire family who happens to loathe her. Obviously, this is only the beginning of this soupy, soapy novel, better named \\"My boyfriend is a teenage vampire\\". Vegetarian, goody-goody vampires at that, who happily admit Bella in her midst, but beware of the evil vampires!Now, what amount of silliness can this story hold? All you can ever want, apparently. I'm not particularly fond of vampire stories, but if you are, read Burying the Shadow by Storm Constantine or the St Germain's-Victoria Clemens saga by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, not this watery drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm","review":"Is it just me or is this book written so simply it hurts. Bella the main character seems to obey and let Edward push her around, growl at her and such, and these two are meant to be so devastatingly in love that it is the greatest love story.... I'm reading New Moon now and am finding it even worse. It's ok .. but I don't know if its worthy of the obsession."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING, INCREDIBLE, ABSOLUTELY PRAISEWORTHY","review":"Twilight is the best book ever. How anyone could not like it is a mystery never to be solved. Edward is amazing. Bella is great, but she needs more depth. Actually, so does Edward. But, that doesn't matter at all. My friend wants to be Mrs. Edward Cullen. This book is absolutely astounding. I don't see how anyone can possibly write that well. Me and all my friends have fallen in love with this book and all its characters and adventures and twists and turns. We wait anxiously for the next books to come!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Content Sigh","review":"Twilight was one of the best books I've ever read.

I totally agree and thank them for telling me about it.I adore Stephenie Meyer and these are my favorite and only books I have read of hers. I am now reading Breakimg Dawn and I am about finished with it. I dont get why people give bad reviews for this great book.

Although, I have to warn you she never finished it. Which is such a shame because it was so great reading it from Edward's perspective. Reading it will leave you feeling sad that there was not more)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get past page 6.","review":"Wanted to like this book, as an old vampire fan from ages past, but was put off by Bella producing enough angst over her morning breakfast to submerge my basement.I like my vampires with that traditional Nosferatu edge sans sparkles.Wasn't my cuppa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I'm giving this two stars because it was a page turner. However, it lacked in every respect. Flimsy characters, MIA plot, substandard writing and there's no \\"there\\" there. You end this book with no additional insignts into the human condition, nothing learned, no thoughts provoked, just time wasted turning empty pages.If you want to read hundreds of pages describing how handsome sparkly vampires are, this is the book for you. Otherwise, it makes a good doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but too emo.","review":"I love paranormal books and romance doesn't bother me, but Bella was very unlikeable to me. I know people absolutely love the Twilight series, but I really wasn't very impressed. What I will say is, Meyer's view of Vampires is unique, and I did like the idea of good vampires. Although feeding on animals or criminals is not a unique concept, the whole glittering emo thing was different. I do enjoy when a writer develops the emotional aspect of the characters in the story, but I have to say, this series pretty much went over my limit. Of all the books in the series, this one was tolerable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I cannot stress how much I hated this book.

I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is everyone so impressed by this book?","review":"Don't get me wrong - she's a competent writer, her prose flows smoothly and she has a deft hand with description. But the plot? It offers nothing new to the vampire fantasy genre - fantasy and vampire lovers would be far better off reading Robin McKinley's Sunshine. And the conflict of whether or not to live forever? It's been done before, Tuck Everlasting would be an example, and Meyer's book has nothing new to say on the subject. The book is enjoyable, the main character sympathetic, but ultimately it failed to hold my interest or to say anything truly original. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't","review":"I'm begging you, don't read this drivel. There are many better YA options out there (try Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy). I read the entire saga and seriously wished I hadn't. I don't know how I can emphasize just how terrible and poorly written this series was. Even as a guilty pleasure, I wouldn't recommend it. How it managed to become so popular is beyond me.Don't do it. You'll regret it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inane. Sexist. Redundant.","review":"This book is written at the level of a 3rd grader. However, it is inappropriate for children so young, and therefore has no reasonable target audience. As an english teacher, I would grade each chapter an F for structure, grammar, and plot. Altogether an insult to modern literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"momsread","review":"My daughter expressed a deep interest in these books so I took one with me on a biz trip to preview. I would not say that I was disapointed, I knew it was TL in the first place, but I was really surprised at how week the main character was portrayed. She takes no responsibility for herself or her own emotions, relying instead on others to lift her up and to make her circumstances more bearable. She is further portrayed as klutzy, accident prone with low self-esteem and instead of the author developing Bella's strengths, it seems she focuses on developing her dependence on a boyfriend, again to solve her problems for her and save her from herself.I discussed a few of these topics with my daughter but urged her to read it for herself. She thought it would have been a brilliant story, had Bella become a stronger person too, instead of resigning herself to whatever fate (joy with boyfriend, doom without) doled out for her. Sparkly Vampires??? This one had us both in stitches....."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Ain't no Harry Potter","review":"When I originally heard about this series, I was like cool another Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But instead there is this insipid girl risking her life for so called love. The casual way she risk her life is misleading and dangerous, I was totally underwhelmed. I literally read the book out of stubborness and boredom but I was repulsed by the simpleness of Bella. To me it seems to encourage suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING and ANNOYING","review":"I don't think I can even finish this book. Bella could be the most boring main character. There is no basis for their \\"love.\\" All she cares about is how beautiful he is. Give me a break. The writing is even worse. The words that I must have found on every other page include sinuous, breath, and beautiful. It's like the writer took her thesaurus and wrote the same thing over and over again in different words. Do not buy this book. I wish I could give it zero stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love story, fine. Mediocre writing, not so fun.","review":"I bought this book, thinking, it must be good, look all that 5 star reviews and people obviously love it.The characters are just poorly established. I mean vampires, come on, I expect more than just being gorgeous, perfect, super-natured. I tried to hold on to the book with believes that this can't be it. But whatever other readers are excited about, I didn't get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"I found about about this series courtesy of an Amazon notice, and although I am well into my 40's, I took the plunge. The entire series ended up being well-worth the risk! Very, very well-developed story with characters you care about; action; mystery; humour; and romance. The relationship between Bella and Edward is one of the most beautiful I've ever read. I look forward to more volumes to come, the sooner the better!

A must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know it's bad but i still love it","review":"Listen i know that Twilight is not a well written or well thought out book. But i don't know what it is, the book just draws me in. i am a huge Harry Potter fan and those are probably the best young adult fiction that i have ever read. Rowling paints a picture of a fictional world so well that you fell like you must have been there some how. Meyer does not have that ability with her writing. Meyer puts you in the head of a 17 year old girl in love, and having been one of those i can say it is a pretty dull place. But the feelings you have are real and the way you feel for that person is very intense and really your life is pretty much consumed by them. However in Twilight it border lines on a sickness, especially in the second one. But it is you either love it or hate it just understand that those who love it, the book, are not stupid or shallow it just touches a special place that we can not explain. I know that book sucks but i love them deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A M A Z I N G!","review":"Very Addictive!

I thought for sure I'd have gotten bored with it because it's 500 pages long, but surprisingly I wasn't. It was an interesting, romantic, intense love story between Bella and Edward. The ending was a cliff-hanger, so it left me wanting more.Stephenie Meyer has got talent. She has a way of writing that just pulls and sucks you in to their world. The tension (sexual and otherwise) she creates between the two just adds so much to it. She is a GREAT writer. My new fave.I can't wait to read the sequel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book series I've ever read!","review":"Without a doubt-- the BEST book series I have read. This is the first book of the Twilight series (the second is New Moon, the third is Eclipse and the fourth is out in August and is called Breaking Dawn). I recommend this book to anyone and everyone. It's romance and heartbreak and friendship and real and of course vampires. :) It is breath-takingly and beautifully written. if I could give it a million stars- i would."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad behevior","review":"iv never read the and i just rated it whatever.but all i wanted to say was some of these people giving bad reports and saying or mimicking something from the bible... thats unexepecteble.i believe God should have His respect.im not joking.and if you think im like thirty your wrong... im only ten!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story.","review":"I enjoyed the movie Twilight so I went back to read the series. The first book started off very well. I enjoyed Bella's journey leaving her mother and moving in with her father adn of course, meeting handsome Edward. There was a lot of backstory that obviously didn't make the film but overall good read. Stephanie Meyer's rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"so boring vampires used to be cool go team wolf kid or what everthis is my grandpahave a nice day"},{"rating":"1","title":"what??","review":"The writing is awful. Bella is awful. Edward is awful.The book has too many boring conversations, too many long boring descriptions. I don't care how Bella is making dinner every night. I don't care if she's chopping chicken. Then she's simmering something. Then she's going to the fridge. Then she thinks about Edward. Then she goes back to the stove.... then she thinks about Edward - why doesn't he like me? Oh no, my roast is almost done!The characters have no personalities. Bella falls down every couple of pages. This book is like reading the rambling diary of a fourteen year old girl.And Edward? Apparently his eyes are so enthralling that they need to be mentioned several times per chapter.I'm not even half way through the book and the desire to return it to my neighbor is overwhelming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I'm a little late getting on the \\"Twilight Bandwagon\\" but I'm fineally there.It was maybe not quite Riviting but I did have trouble putting it down till it was finished. It's easy to get caught up in the tension and drama of the book. I liked it so much I'm hesitant to see the movie b/c sometimes the movie doesn't live up to your expectations...This is a Great Book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The surprise read","review":"I initially bought this book for my teenaged daughter to read. She consumed the entire novel in one night. Needless to say, I felt I needed to find out just what made the story so good as to stay up all night to finish it. After getting through the first third of the book, I was hooked. Meyers' ability to write convincing teenaged angst is remarkable, as is her skills in telling a tale of first love - even though the love is between a human and a vampire."},{"rating":"2","title":"An adult male perspective","review":"With over 5,000 other reviews here, I'll keep this very short.These books are very addictive, easy-to-read, and gripping. The storyline hooks you in and keeps you turning pages as quickly as you can until you hit the end. They are appropriately written for all ages - the language is clean, the violence is more implied than gory, and there are no sex scenes.On the down side, they lack the depth of character development of other books like Rowling's \\"Harry Potter\\" series and lack the depth of setting and history like Anne Rice's \\"Vampire\\" series. They are sort of like a PG rated Harlequin-style Horror romance. They're fun, gripping, and interesting. Highly recommended as a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"So addictive","review":"I could not put this book down. I can't tell you exactly why I was addicted, but I was!! I loved it all. It kept me turning pages all the way through and I can't wait to get my hands on book two. Way to go Stephenie Meyer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read so far...","review":"I watch the movie before reading the book. Even though I knew the story already; I still cannot stop reading it. The book has more details which movie didn't show (of course). And then, I went back to watch the movie one more time, and all I can say is, I become one of the vampire fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"USA gets all the good versions","review":"This version of the book was never released in Australia, so the only way for me to buy it was through Amazon. The cover art is better than the standard Edward/Bella combo we got, and this book includes a poster too. Always good to get something for free for no reason.I have fallen in love with this story, and have loved getting this book. Thanks to Amazon. :)This is a great story about an ordinary teenage girl who falls in love with a vampire. Stephenie Meyer has written the story in a way that draws the reader into her world, where vampires 'don't want to be monsters' and gives Edward and Bella a normal start to their relationship, except that he wants to drink her blood."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, enjoyable, easy read","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book. It is nothing spectacular, but it is greatly entertaining and the characters (the cullens) are easy to fall in love with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring and did I mention Boring!!!","review":"I read this book to see what all the hype is about. To be honest this book was very boring. The story line is too predictable. It is a story about a 17 year old girl in love. This book has about as much suspense as watching car rust. This book would have been a good read if you are a 15 year old girl. If you are anything more than a teen then read something written for an adult. The Anne Rice vampire books are a hundred times better and will keep you interested. It was all I could do to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This book is nothing but fluff. Bella's character takes the womens movement back 10 decades, with her constant damsel in ditress bit. Jane Austin wrote stronger female leads in the 19th century. Edward might as well have been made of stone. His one dimensional character is sooo boring, I could hardly keep my eyes open. As for the story itself...well, if you like to know every excrutiating detail of some boring girls life with some vampires thrown in the mix, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Brain is Melting","review":"How? Why? Yes yes vampires have flesh as hard as marble. How about an original thought? The constant mentioning of her hair was numbing. Any teenage girl that is not only the new kid, but also the best looking knows it - come on. Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!!","review":"I decided to read this book because of all of the hype it was getting - read it before any of the movies were even in production. At first I was skeptical, I thought, you've got to be kidding me. Then I kept reading, couldn't put it down. I am extremely picky about what I read, I thought Twilight was an excellent book, before I was even finished reading it I had to buy the next one. Give it a try, men & women of all ages love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So overrated","review":"This is truly one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The author uses incredibly basic sentence structures that really distracted me from the story. It really felt like it was written by a junior high kid, at best. The story itself is interesting, but the main character, Bella, I found immensely unlikeable. When I finished the book, I was actually upset with myself that I wasted so much time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing worse than vogan poetry...","review":"has officially been written.Cut the prologue. (You're just setting up a false climax that your heroine is unconscious for anyway).On page 5: \\"It ws to Forks that I now exiled myself--an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks.\\" Okay, first, you don't \\"exile yourself\\" you either \\"go\\" or you \\"are exiled by others.\\"Understand, the basic stupidity of this sentence, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I honestly cannot understand how this book became so popular. It is so boring and ridiculous! The story gets so fake at times that it is absolutely painful to continue reading. I definitely won't be reading the other books that follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written with an irresistable plot for teens","review":"It makes VC Andrews (if you are old enough to remember those books) read like high literary prose. I'm sure I would have loved these at 12 or 13 - what teenaged girl can resist this plot of an unearthly gorgeous 17 year old vampire (who is also wildly rich) in love with a mortal girl in high school? It is so badly written, so full of cliches and corny metaphors and forced events that I ended up scanning passages hoping for decent morsels to read. The Potter books at least had some decent writing and dealt with larger issues. Still, any girl 17 and under is going to devour these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story, writing not so great","review":"Don't get me wrong, I loved this book as much as the next crazed fan. My only grip with it is the writing. It's juvenile and boring. The structure of the sentences and descriptions are lethargic, there are tons of cliche descriptions(i.e. \\"he looked like a male model for raincoats.\\" and describing Edward as an angel.) Been there, done that. With that said, I'm amazed at how entranced I became with this book. I got it yesterday and finished it in 5 hours flat. I literally couldn't bear to put it down. It hurt to leave the book! And I, probably with his league of girls around the globe, have fallen in love with Edward. I'm just puzzled at how Meyer did that: bad writing yet had me fall helplessly in love with a fictional character. Bizarre. Must be some kind of magic there. I was DAZZLED! =)))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"In my study hall I saw this book lying on the ground. I read the back, and wasn't sure I'd like it. I read it, and read it again, and again, and, well you get the picture! I now own both books currenly out on the market! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"i read Twilight in about six hours it was the most captvating books i had every read Srephenie Meyer brought the world of Vampires and teengagers and merged them together i will be on my fifth time reading Twilight and still has the same impact on me as it did the first day i read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Fluff","review":"As fluff goes, this was an entertaining tale of teenage love/angst. This series was a guilty pleasure as I have read all four books. However, if you are looking for great writing with deep meaning, get something else. Really, this is a book for tweens, don't expect Shakespeare. I would have rated it a three star fluff book except for the author's disturbing decision to have her heroine constantly express her inferiority to the male leads. I am not pretty enough, I am not worthy, etc. Give me a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting.","review":"This was really interesting and intelligent book, aside from the many misnomers about my home state of Washington, and some issues that were not fully developed like Bella's attraction of danger and near death experiences hopefully the next two installments will explore these issues. I loved this book despite of those flaws and I am anxious to engage in one of the sequels. It's rare for a teen title to be so well crafted and the dialogue so adult and inviting. I think the size and subject matter will put off some teens but those that pick it up will not be able to put it down, nor will they be able to stop wondering what will be come of Bella in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It felt like I was reading a tween girl's diary.","review":"Considering all the hype surrounding this series, I thought I was in for a treat. I read The Host by S. Meyer and I thought it was tolerable and I presumed this would be a substantially better read. I was wrong.I found that I didn't care at all about the girl or the super cute boy who was mean to her. I'll admit to being a 30 year old man, and would suggest that other 30 year old men only read this if you want to understand the content of what your children are reading. But beware... your brain will hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a long time!!!","review":"I loved this book for the love. It's so innocent.

Her words are like music to my ears and she inspires me so much.All I have to say is: Go team Edward!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After viewing the movies, had to see how Twilight Book 1 set it up","review":"I'm one of the few fans of book adaptions to movies - how Grisham's The Firm translated, Angels and Demons, etc. With Twilight, which of course is already a global franchise, I had to go back to the beginning.My take is that the director, Catherine Hardwick, who directed the \\"Twilight\\" movie, really boiled the ocean here, creating tight characters, setting up the high school and town as best possible. I had to shake my head when she read the 'vampire softball' game scene though, as the implausibility or even rationale for ageless \\"teens\\" playing softball seemed very corny.I wonder if Hardwick hadn't directed \\"Twilight\\" if the series would have stayed as long. Again, interesting YA model of writing from Mormon author, but very lucky to have a strong female director own the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed!!!!","review":"i ordered the used copy of twilight part 1. i thought it was going to be ok looking since its supposed to be \\"like new\\". well it wasn't! the book is all torn and is in real bad shape. i hope pages aren't missing. i guess i'll find out as i read. very disppointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So much better than I expected!","review":"I held off for so long to read and watch the Twilight Saga, but after watching the 2nd movie I'm hooked. As is typical, this book is so much better than the corresponding movie. It starts off a little juvenile, but turns addicting very soon. I couldn't wait to get back to it every time I put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Audio Book","review":"Pretty much everyone knows the story of Twilight. Bella (weak human with good smelling blood) falls in love with Edward (strong vampire who wants Bellas blood) and problems follow.My gripe is the lady who reads Twilight on the audio book. The way she reads the book, enunciates the words and...pretty much everything....is horribly distracting and downright annoying.Save your money. The movie is easier to sit through then this lady reading the book. And thats definitely saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out Harry Potter, there is a new best seller!","review":"If you haven't read this book, you are missing out. At school I noticed alot of girls reading this book, so I decided that I wanted to read it if it is so good. I think it took me about 3 days to read because I couldn't put it down! If you saw the movie, It is exacty like the movie, but with more detail. I would recomend it to anyone who likes romance, action, and is over probably 12. I give it an A+!(I am actually the daughter of F. Allen \\"Aggie fan\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, but slow paced...","review":"I heard all about how poorly-written this book is supposed to be, but I didn't find it that way, and I'm particular about grammar and syntax. Stephenie Meyer has a degree in literature, and it shows, although the pacing could definitely be a little more concise. I enjoyed the book, but then I again I enjoy all those old gothic romances from the 1960's and 1970's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you don't think about what you're reading","review":"I first started reading the Twilight saga when I was about thirteen, and I loved it. A few months later, I realized my mistake.Bottom line? This book would be pretty good as a drinking game. Take a shot every time Bella describes Edward as \\"flawless\\" or \\"perfect\\" or some other fanciful something.

I watched the Twilight movie when it was on cable and was surprised that I didn't hate it. I liked the Washington scenery, the history of the tribes and people, the relateable-Bella (to me, anyway), but most of all, Edward made me fall in love with the story and not be able to put the book down.

The story is about a girl named Bella that falls for an attractive boy named Edward. What she didnt know was that Edward and his family were actually VAMPIRES!THe most interesting part was that when she found out it didnt really bother her and that was different from other storie ive read. The story was of course suspensful when a vampire tracker was in a challenge to hunt down Bella. My heart raced as Edward tried hard to protect her. I would be more detailed with this book but you seriously need to read this because I would probably give the story away with all the excitement i have after reading it. I really recommend this to teens my age and say BE READY FOR THIS AMAZING RIDE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great build up and atmosphere","review":"What I liked most about this book was the build up. There's Bella one end of the classroom and this strange group the other. The mystery of it draws you in and by then I was hooked. A bit like, you know, how we first used to look at Goths in a strange way at first in school. I can't help feeling that's been an influence here. The good thing was she didn't expect us to believe in vampires straight off.Some have mentioned the repetition and I did find it a bit long and slow at times. But then I was younger when I read it and did find the atmosphere wonderful overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Series","review":"My husband brought this book home knowing that I love to read vampire and paranormal books. I read the first one and thought it was well written. Then I took a trip to a book store and found out that it was written for teens. I was in shock. I didn't realize. Then I thought about the story line and thought it was a great fit. This series talks about not fitting into the crowd, feeling like and outsider, and the mystery of sex with a very nice twist of the guy wanting to make it right. I thoroughly enjoyed this series of books. I have read all three books. I was a little sad with the second one but thought about today's kids after I read it. I think this book hit the nail on the head when describing a teen of today. They are lost, feel outside the group, and not sure how to put that front up to find their place. I look forward to reading more by this author. The book group I belong to so far all agree with me in giving this series two thumbs up.Sincerely,Laurie"},{"rating":"2","title":"a vamiric love story","review":"Twilight a vamiric love storyIn this vampiric love story Bella a thin pale girl from phoenix Arizona, moves to forks to live with her father.

Hey, I don't hate on people for liking it, it's the rabid Twilight fans that continually feel the need to bash anyone who states an opinion opposite from their own, that really tick me off, even though they are clearly too unintelligable to see the MAJOR FLAWS in this sorry excuse for a novel.My advice: read the book anyway, but do not let cruel reviews like mine bias your reading, nor let the floods of gushing illiterates cloud your view of the book's true worth.Also, I'm sorry that I didn't elaborate much in this review. Many of the other low-raters were able to write eloquent diatribes that describe Twilight's flaws better than I ever could. Thanks for considering my opinion. =P"},{"rating":"1","title":"wow, this was dreadful reading...","review":"As many have already echoed, this book is very amateurish and leaves little to the imaginiation. I couldn't help but get irritated with the writing style, which was obviously aimed at teenagers. It also seemed like an homage to Anne Rice's Interview With A Vampire books, except written by a hack. If this is what it takes to get published then the literary world is in a lot of trouble. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mary Sue got published.","review":"To put it succinctly, I'm amazed this book got published in the first place. The copy editor must have been asleep when they read this one, because the book is very poorly written and could have been much better if someone had bothered to go through it with a red pen before it was published. I've read much better written Mary Sue fan fiction that had a better plot and better characterization than this novel, not to mention less saccharine melodrama.If, like me, you're going to read \\"Twilight\\" at the behest of friends, check it out of the local library and save your money and the wasted paper stock. If the sappy Mary Sue schtick winds up being your thing after all, then order the whole series and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for this story","review":"Alot of people are raving about this book that was the reason I bought it to see what it was all about especially since the movie is coming out. I was very disappointed with the story. Everything revolved around Bella and she was such a clutz. Also when she and Edward declare themselves it was just too unrealistic.Don't think I will continue the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenage-Vampire Romance For Teenagers Only","review":"I'm not sure if Stephanie Meyer is trying to be the new Anne Rice here, but she has created her own world - a world where vampires glow! The first 3rd of the book was boring, dealing with the daily life of insecure Bella. The novel only got interesting where Bella was introduced to the Cullens and the subsequent fight with another hunter vampire from another coven, who was hunting her.If you're into teenage romance and daily life events that are repeated over and over again or if you want to relive your high school days, this book is for you, otherwise, I don't think this novel is mature enough for adults to read, it just seems rather retarded in the romance and emotional department.A movie is in the making though, starring Robert Pattison (Cedric Diggory) & Kristen Stewart. I wonder if they will portray the female character Bella as weak, insecure and needy - that will be sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry to say this","review":"I wanted to like this book. I REALLY did. After all the hype it got, I thought I'd find at least something good in it, but I couldn't. The characters were flat and unoriginal. The story, predictable. And all that SAP! I'm sorry. I just don't see what all the fuss is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"just plain bad","review":"I really did not like this book. I picked it up because everyone said it is a must read, and that it was the best book ever. But when I actually read I figured out that it was a stupid book without a real plot.Now before you yell at me listen to this,Bella and Edward are in love right, but Stephanie Meyer doesn't show you that in the book. They are just all of a sudden together, I mean theres no falling in love they are kind of just wary of each other then proffesing undying love.And they both say practically the same sentence throughout the entire book. Bella says \\"I love you!\\" and thats about it. And Edward says \\"I love you. But Im a vampire\\" and \\"I want to eat you, you smell so good.\\" And thats pretty much the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dracula 90210","review":"Stephenie Meyers novel marks a steep decline for the vampire genre. No thanks. Give me real creatures of the night, and preferably ones who are at least adults. Twilight Twi-bites, and not in a good way. Recommended for tweens only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I just finished reading this book and it was godawful. I realize that maybe it's too much to ask for some actual character development in a book that is aimed at young teenagers, but still the author gave no reason to even *like* the characters. Bella is a completely boring, two-dimensional character; every time she wondered what Edward saw in her, I was thinking the exact same thing. And beyond the fact that he's pretty, I can't see any reason why she would love Edward. For the vast majority of the novel, he acted like a psycho jerk with worse mood swings than pregnant woman. And this book repeatedly violated one of the fundamentals of good writing: show, don't tell. We had to listen to Edward drone on and on and on about what a vampire is, and how he was changed, and how his family came to be, blah, blah, blah. So boring! I had to force myself to finish it. Needless to say, I will definitely not be reading the sequels."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could have given a zero, I would have.","review":"Absolutely terribly written and executed. I don't even know if a decent author could have saved this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just glad I didn't have to pay for it","review":"This book stinks. The fact that people are happy that this book is encouraging young people to read, while it promotes an abusive relationship as \\"true love\\", is reprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biggest waste of my life.","review":"Seriously, save your money and time and buy something else. This whole series (not just the first book) reads like bad fanfiction from a 13 year old girl who has never even HEARD of vampires. I'm sorry, but a person who sparkles in the sunlight, only eats animals and doesn't have fangs is not a vampire. It's a friggen PIXIE.You want a book with action, suspense, 3D/believable characters? Won't get it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Writing","review":"I don't understand the popularity of this book. There is no depth to the writing and the characters are one dimensional. Thank god I read a library copy of the book and did not spend my hard earned money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to enjoy it....but was unsuccessful","review":"I gave it a chance and read the first 150 pages. I finally had to end my pain and put it down. Not being a female, I was hoping that it would somehow give me an insight on the life of teenage girls and their time in high school. Unfortunately, it was at best shallow and often cringe inducing. Please spend your reading time on something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes, he's a handsome vampire","review":"Title says it all... and that's what 60% of the book is about.The vampire is handsome.And just in case we didn't mention it, the vampire is handsome.Oh... let's throw in some action at the end to kinda-sorta have a story...Please don't hate me, I read the book, I just didn't like it so much.In an ironic twist, the movie was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!","review":"Well. this book is just great! i don't think they made a word that can discribe this book. the bad thing is it makes other books look bad. it's that good. and i love how she kept with her religon when she wrote this. if you know what i mean... it's great for 12+. i even know a guy who read this. he liked it. and every girl will love it garenteed. and if a guy is willing to read romance he will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"sooooo Amazing!","review":"I absolutely love love loved this!! I literally could not put it down until it was finished as soon as I started it - the story completely sucks you in. I like that Bella is a clumsy and accident prone girl who isn't amazingly beautiful because it makes her seems so relatable & Meyer's introduction of Edward's character makes you not only involve yourself in their romance in the most wonderful way, but understand it. I also love her interpretation of vampires, it was so nice to go beyond all the lame \\"buffy\\"esq vampire cliches.I ammmmm so obsessed with Bella and Edward & cannot wait for the movie or to begin reading New Moon!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling, sexy, can't-put-it-down kind of read","review":"I of course bought this book in anticipation for the movie coming out in December. I had heard of it and thought now would be the perfect time to read it. I never imagined zipping through it in two days! I could not put it down and barely got any sleep the days I read it. It is an amazing story of unconventional love. I believe it is targeted to high school girls, but even as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it.Twilight made me believe in fairy tale-style love again."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a rip off","review":"I have not received this book, I have contacted both the seller and Amazon and let you know I did not receive this book, I would like a refund!!!!!Sincerely,Theresa Guiver"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I finished reading Twilight over the weekend after seeing the movie. I thought it was a great read. This is one instance where the book is WAY better than the movie. The story is interesting and captivating. I am 30 years old and not normally a fan of this genre of book, but this is a love story that makes you feel the characters hearts beating (well the one's of them that have beating hearts) through the pages. I couldn't put it down and bought New Moon before I finished the last pages of Twilight.I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried!","review":"I tried to enjoy this book, I really did. When I didn't, I read the second book to see if the story would get a little more involved and in-depth. It doesn't. How much ridiculous teen angst can be packed into one story? \\"Oh, I love you but I can't be with you!\\" Oh, I think I may vomit.While Meyers adds some new ideas to vampire mythology, she isn't doing anything for the teenage brains this book is targeted at. A laundry list of an average teenage life is not going to captivate many readers, and the constant pull and tug of the protagonist's relationship with Edward (the weirdly obsessed vampire) is frankly annoying. If I was a friend of Bella Swan's I would have to slap her to her senses."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"this book and the entire saga that follows is truely amazing. after reading the books i was at a loss to fid something new to read after because it seemed that nothing could be as good. this series really is the best ive read in quite some time. go stephanie meyers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book that I read on my iPhone!","review":"Everyone had told me to read the Twilight series, but I didn't want tospend the money on the books.......was going to wait until I found someone who was finished with them. Then I saw that it was available on Kindle & I could read it on my iPhone. I had my doubts, but decided to try it....I made the font larger so I didn't have to wear my glasses, surprisingly finished it in a few hours, loved it so much I downloaded all of them & read them all in a few days. I'm sure I \\"turned\\" the page thousands of times, but it was seamless & easy, never annoyed me. It was awesome!!!!!

I have read this book 4 times and I continue to never get tired of it. I highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Biting Into","review":"Twilight is as bad as my cliche title to this review. I found myself skipping pages in hopes of finding something interesting written by Stephanie Meyer. I only started reading it to see what all the hype is about and now I am realizing the power groups of 12 year old girls have over the media. Almost as much power as Edward Cullens mesmerizing gaze - the one thing I think that really gives him appeal - and merely because you have no choice in the matter. If this is what a \\"good read\\" has come to, I am not sure how I will survive the rest of my life. Please, mass media, you've already came and imposed your uneducated, uncultured, uninteresting self upon the theatre, don't ruin literature too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me summarize the negative reviews.","review":"I hate novels that do not follow the storyline that I like. How dare the author share her story with us in the way she sees it. She should definitely - in the future - ask me in what direction to take her story. Twilight - being fiction - should have characters that are COMPLETELY believable. How dare she create a fictional story, with fictional characters that do not act the way I believe they should - in a fictional manner. (All of this sounds rediculous? I agree.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight (need I say more?)","review":"This book is a great modern story. Thsi is the story of Isabella Swan and how her average life was turned upside down when she decided to go live with her dad in the small town of Forks. She did not expect to find danger and near death experiences. She also did not expect to find Edward Cullen. They develop their tentative romance only to find that they might not hve long together.

The vampire(Edward Cullen) wants to drink(no pun intended) the human's (Bella Swan) blood. The Cullen family is different than other's of there kind; they only drink animal blood. Edward and Bella must go though challenges while they fall in love. I am afraid that i will spoil the WHOLE SERIES if i keep talking. SO READ THE BOOK!!!!!!!!!!! GO TEAM EDWARD"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - so dreamy, so gripping...","review":"I've read a few vampire books in my day and this is up there with the best. I had no idea what to expect.

Let's make sure we (& most especially the author) understand that \\"Bestseller\\" just means \\"Most popular\\" & really doesn't have much to do with quality. I thought the writing was pretty shabby. Dust \\"moats?\\" Come on. It was as if they were all in such a hurry to get it to press so they could start raking in the big bucks, they didn't even bother to edit the thing. If I ever see the word \\"shattered\\" again before I die it will be way too soon.The best purpose it could possibly serve for young people would be as a stepping-stone to Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do people see in this?","review":"Twilight is officially one of the top 5 WORST books I've ever read.

This book is the tortuous result of a Mormon housewife's erotic dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agonizing","review":"The main reason I was able to finish this book was because I had to read it for a young adult novels class I took in college. The narrator, Bella, drove me crazy! The way she gushes, goes weak in the knees, and obsesses over Edward almost made me nauseous. The writing is average at best, and the overplayed drama sometimes made me want to throw the book across the room. The only reason I'm not giving it one star is because she tried a new spin on vampires, albeit a weak one. I cannot believe the fascination with this book, although I can see how a thirteen-year-old girl might find this entertaining. If you're not a thirteen-year-old girl, don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't have time to read... and yet...","review":"So... here's the deal. I'm in college and it's actually my last term. I don't have time to read. However, I bought this book with wishful thinking. ... I read the whole novel in a day! I, simply, could NOT put it down. Bella is so easy to relate to. She's so cynical and sarcastic and yet so full of emotion... and Edward is to die for! In my mind he is simply amazing. I have never written a review before. In fact I should be doing homework right now, but I fell in love with this book and I can almost guarantee you will too. If anything, its SO much better than homework! I highly, HIGHLY, recommend this book. It's just beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly disappointed","review":"This book really upset me because I have a 14 year old daughter and I would never want her to be like Bella. She is so dependent on Edward. If he isn't at school she is depressed. She is willing to go out with him even though he might harm her. She would be willing to do anything just to be with him.

The book made me appreciate their relationship more. I could read/feel how much he cared for her. I'm jealous of Bella Swan. She has Edward! :)I'm a proud Twilight fan.

It has endless pointless dialogue, sappy love scenes, and very little suspense or plot at all!!! It's not much different than a sappy romance novel. It feels like she is trying to spin out the story so that it has 500 plus pages, with a very thin plot. The characters are not beleiveable, or likable, even!! Too bad there's only one JK Rowling!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"Even though I'm a 27-year-old male and not quite the core demographic for this book, I decided to give it a try. The trailer for the upcoming film version looked quite action-packed. Of course, trailers are often misleading, and this is the case for Twilight. Most of the book deals with the protagonist's thoughts and feelings as she moves to the small town of Forks, WA and adjusts to life in the countryside. Only in the final one-fifth of the book does the pace really pick up, putting the heroine in significant danger. I felt that the book was quite slow until this part, but this last section of the book did make reading the book worthwhile. Therefore, I recommend this book to fans of the vampire genre, as well as the following books in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"In all fairness I am not a teenage girl...","review":"In all fairness I am not a teenage girl... Reading this book reminds me how grateful I am to have survived that swift and painful passage. The concept of the book , a \\"human girl\\" falling in love with a \\"vampire boy\\" was mildly interesting beyond that this book was poorly written and uninspiring. The identical conversation between the two main characters, \\"Bella\\" and\\"Edward\\" repeated itself over and over throughout the entire book until I found myself wanting to beat my own head against the wall. The concept of 2 selfless teenagers is of course a stretch, add the trite idea of the new girl in town who never wears mascara yet all the local boys fall instantly in love with her to the fascination of the daily life of a teenager described in minute detail over and over and you too will be wanting to beat your head against the wall. Unless of course you are a teenage girl..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan!","review":"I know I'm in the minority, but did not care for this one. Finished it in two days, but just so I could quickly move on to something better. I think that one of the main reasons for my disliking it, is that so many \\"mature\\" women are over-the-top in love with it. I just don't get it. I felt that the writing and dialogue were downright juvenile. I know it's a young adult book, but I have read others in that category that I love (ie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series). And call me a traditionalist, but I want my literary vampires to be scary, not romantic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I read this book because all the girls in the office were raving avout it and i am an avid reader, so i just had to get my hands on it. What utter rubbish.... The story is extremely predictable and Bella couldn't feel more sorry for herself if she tried. For the \\"herione\\" she is extRemely obtuse. This book apprears to be the retarded offspring of a dimestore romance novel and a cheesy vampire tv series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I kind of get the hype","review":"I read this book not expecting too much. It was just one of those books I thought I should read because of all the hype around it. For the first third of the book my first impressions were justified - it was what you would expect of any pulp fiction. However I must admit I became addicted as the relationship between Bella and Edward progressed and then found it hard to put down. While the writing is ordinary, the plot keeps you enthralled."},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the love?","review":"This is not a romance or a love story. Plain and simple. He is attracted to the scent of her blood and is driven by his blood-lust of her and she is attracted to him physically. The book doesn't offer us enough reasons as to why they fell in love with eachother. Which if it was true, unadulterated love, they would have fell for eachother's character and inner person. The book doesn't offer enough depth of character for either one of them to actually be in love. They fall \\"in love\\" too quickly for to be sincere. He stalks her. She is co-dependant of him. Nothing about this story is genuine. I think i have mentioned the word love enough so i am going to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I have read all the Twilight books and this was the worst.

But, this first book, in my opinion is not really very well written. I'm halfway thru the 3rd book right now. Her descriptive writing is really not very good and I found myself skipping over words and knowing I didn't miss a thing. Did I feel like a lot was missing from the movie? Not at all. Quite frankly, being on the 3rd book, my feeling is that her writing is much better on screen than in type. I always had a problem with the 90-year-old and a 16 or 17-year-old. At least this 1st book gives an explanation for both their behaviors that makes sense to me. However, it paints a picture of Bella that totally makes no sense and does not jibe with the movie character I remember. Anyways, I was a big Interview With a Vampire et al. fan, but not really here. This is fun and very quick reading. Two stars because I don't think you should expect a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Good as Eclipse","review":"Stephenie Meyers just didn't cut my satisfaction with this book and Edward sounds like a creepy boyfriend to be honest. Bella is a stubborn bitch that takes life too seriously meanwhile keeping a lot of things a secret which sounds dangerous. Jacob's the jerk who tries to control Bella's life and make fun of Edward's lifestyle. Charlie is the lazy dad that should be trying to sound fun or even considerate rather than being the \\"Whatever, it's your choice!\\". Alice sounds like she's taken too many painkillers. Plus there's not a lot of humour here so I'm definitely sorry to buy this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT READ","review":"Twilight is a very suspenseful, witty, hard-to-put-down novel. The characters come to life so easily and you can actually see not only the characters but where the action takes place because of the excellent descriptions that are not tedious but fluid.A great read and hopefully the movie has stuck to the novel and not made too many \\"poetic license\\" changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight (Twilight, Book 1)","review":"I absolutely love this book...the whole series in fact.

However, from the start the book captured my interest. If you are concerned about the vampire aspect of the book, or don't want to read it because of it, ignore that and read it anyway. It's about people and the choices they make and how you can ignore what others think and go with your heart. It really was a fun read and riviting throughout. I couldn't put it down. I loved it. I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book","review":"I must be frank and say that this is not the best written book ever, because the plot and lines are cliched and very predictable.

Stephenie Meyer has this unique talent of making the readers happy after reading her book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a gift to my wife, and she loves it.","review":"I bought this as a gift for my wife and she cannot finish talking about this book...AFter she finished reading the entire book, she commented on how great and entertaining this book is...I had to then buy her another two books that belong to this same series...one titled \\"New Moon\\", and the other titled \\"Eclipse\\" both by the same author...So far she is reading New Moon and so far she has had the same reaction as with Twilight...(I'm not much of a novel reader...but, based on my wife's reaction, this is a great buy...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved by Edward","review":"If not for Edward, I would have given this book 2 stars. But as it is, I read Twilight and enjoyed because of him.I found Bella terribly annoying. I got so frustrated with her because she did such stupid things, like following the boys who she even thought looked dangerous and up to no good. Just silly.I liked the push and pull attraction between Bella and Edward. It was what one of the things done well in a book that could stand to lose about 150 pages of narrative that did nothing for the story.Will I read on? From what I can tell from the movies -- of which I've only seen the first one -- I truly doubt it. While I enjoyed and finished this one, one book is about all I can take of two characters and their romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Stephanie Meyer thinking ???","review":"I'd really love to know what a mother of small children is thinking when she's writing a 3-part story that glorifies a predatory relationship. Was she thinking at all? I honestly believe it's hard for parents to put this story into perspective for young girls so that they DON'T fall into controlling relationships. Far from helping the conversation we have with our kids Meyer has romanticized predation beyond all measure and with no real consequences since Bella bounces back quickly from any setback and right back into the arms of her predator. We need far better young reader fiction than this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please make it all just go away! AWFUL!","review":"I finally gave in and decided to listen to the book while I drive back and forth to work (35 minutes both ways). This has been an efficient way to remember that there was a reason I didn't want to read the series in the first place - it stinks - terrible writing, terrible message!If ever there was a weakling, fainting, accident-prone, jellyfish character who relies on men to save her from her own stupidity and lack of physical coordination, Bella wins the prize. Is this the message that young ladies should embrace? I love Jane Austin and the Bronte sisters - their characters were wilting violets whose stories were resolved within a few hundered pages of wonderful writing. Meyer is no Bronte sister, and the writing in the book is awful.Good thing I didn't waste my money to buy the books - and some sucker will by the used version of the CD to get my money back!Even worse, the reader's \\"character\\" voices are irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"It read like a second grader wrote it.

After reading it, I still don't know. Of course, I'm not into vampires so that is no doubt part of my reaction. The other is that it is just way too juvenile for my taste. If it hadn't been adults that were reading it I wouldn't have bothered. I'll definitely take a pass on the others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading is not narration","review":"I have not read the book yet as I often prefer to listen in my car. The reading of this book is horrendous, Ilyana Kadushin has no business calling herself a narrator. I have heard better cadence, rythm and melody in high school valedictorian addresses. It is incredibly distracting. The story is compelling enough but I can only listen in five minute increments due to the below amateurish voice stylings of Ilyana Kadushin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Question for the lovers of the Twilight series","review":"Twilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1)I really like the way Stephenie Meyer's writes.

There are so many great books to read, why pick up this vapid one? Disturbing and disgusting. Is it marketing or fashion? Does the author really like Orson Card and Jane Austen? It is an insult to them both to even be mentioned in connection with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never knew vampires could be so boring.","review":"I think my biggest gripe about this book is that the protagnist has NOTHING going for her outside of the fact that she catches a vampire's eye. She has no hopes, no apirations, no dreams, no hobbies. She cooks for her loser father and placates her shallow mother, and that's IT. And I suppose it aggravates me that the vampire falls for her, because I can't figure out what's so interesting about her. For someone who has been around for 100 years, one would think they'd go for the bizarre or truly unique, instead of shoes that any faint-hearted strumpet could fill. But perhaps that's the book's rather vapid appeal.The rules of the vampires are somewhat original, but I think if they glowed like solar diamonds in the sun they'd be a lot more obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I was very surprised and disappointed by this book. It has so much \\"good hype\\" flying around that I thought I would enjoy it. Completely the opposite.The morals of the characters are non-exisistant. I can't believe it's touted as LDS fiction and sold in LDS (Deseret Book) bookstores. Not to mention that it is slow, boring, completely predictable, silly and down-right stupid. I barely made it 1/4 of the way through.

That to me was interesting and refreshing. However, the story in general was a bit to \\"mary sue\\" for my taste. The main character, Bella is entirely too typical a heroine: she is clutsy and always in need of rescuing, beautiful but doesn't realize it... even though every guy in school decides to ask her out to a girl's choice dance... *roll of eyes*, and the dramatics when she is with Edward grew more and more on my nerves as the book went on. I don't see how it is possible to have a real relationship with a guy who has such power over her that she faints when he kisses her.This book reminds me of a naive 13 year old's fantasy of a real romance.

New Moon comes out, that sucks too. Eclipse, Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2, they all suck. However, when I say this people are quick to shout that the books are better than the movies. I unlike most, had seen the movies after I read the books, and the books, now that I have read it over within the last four years, are surprising not that much better than the movies. Bella is equally annoying in the books. And sadly I didn't notice until I read it over. She is so codependent upon Edward that you forget she had a life of her own without him. She is compulsive and seems like she has no way of controlling herself, which is probably another reason why I stopped liking her. She is just not the type of person I once envisioned her to be when I read the book back in 08'."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to finish","review":"This book was really poorly written and hard to finish. I don't understand all the hype. For a much better book, with werewolves, but without vampires, I recommend Wuthering Heights and a Werewolf.

My daughter can't get enough of this book or the others in the series. She had no desire to read anything much until now. I watched the movie first with her and read ahead all the books. I was very concerned about suggestive content and moral values. Although there is a little bit of reference it is a healthy dose and the overall feel of the adventure is so imaginative and good that I am not concerned.Let your daughter become involved with these great characters and she'll be much more caring and on the right track to womanhood.

Just recently I became a dieheart reader and knew that everyone said the books are better...finally I'm now reading the books.I feel that there are more in depth scenes in the book some better than others.

I really didn't know anything about the book or series, but I will tell you that I read all 4 books in two weeks, juggling a family and a full time job to boot! I didn't know that these were vampire books and was a bit miffed with my friend when that came out but I kept on reading because I was fixated with the characters by then. I am impressed with how clearly and vividly the author describes her characters and how quickly you become immersed in Bella and Edwards life. I really enjoyed these and think that it is a great read. I can't remeber the last time I stayed up until 1:30 to read-college I guess, but that was not for pleasure. I would not suggest this for children under 12, and even then possibly a more mature 12 year old.

Sad because it has become such a pop culture phenomenon, part of a larger phenomenon of vampire-themed shows and movies. That we fetishize shallow, selfish people and unhealthy relationships and reward - idolize even - amateurish writing. I'm sorry to be so harsh about someone who put in so much hard work. At least Stephanie Meyer's hard work has been rewarded, but I am not a fan of the Twilight Series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Read...","review":"I belong to a few book clubs and have read more than 400 books in my 31 years but rarely does a book come along that truely captivates me and captures my undivided attention. I bought the book yesterday afternoon and read the entire book in less than 5 hours.Stephenie Meyer has a wonderful way of keeping you mesmerized by these intriguing characters. I grew up with Buffy & Angel and I can honestly say that Bella and Edward put Buffy & Angels epic love story to shame.Beautifully composed and an absolutely delightful read. I can't wait to read the next book in the Twilight saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impulse buy that definatly paid off","review":"I bought this book on complete impulse. I was buying another book and saw a huge display behind the cash counter. I'd heard some buzz from the movie (I remembered that this was the movie that had taken the place of the next Harry Potter movie) and asked the cashier about the book. She glowed and told me I had to try it.I was hooked after the second chapter. Meyer's has a way of hypnotizing you and completely hooking you on the story. I became so invested in the characters and LOVE how slightly tragic Edward is and how despite everything, Bella simply loves him. For a book that does not have a lot of action, I couldn't wait to turn the page. I finished the book in less than 24 hours and right away, bought the rest of the books in the series. I even got my mother and a co-worker hooked on the series too. They also agree, Meyer's draws you into the story and you are helpless against the pull once you start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampire Review","review":"I saw Twilight the movie b/4 I read the book.

If you are looking for a romance novel that is actually about romance instead of just page after page of meaningless sex scenes TRY THIS! Think of it as Romeo & Juliet, Pride & Prejudice or A Walk to Remember with a sci-fi/ fantasy twist. I feel that the book does a great job exploring the characters and developing the relationships, but keep in mind it is only the first book in a series and much comes later. This book is more like an introduction into the world of Vampires and the relationship of Edward and Bella. I am an adult and I love this book. For anyone who dreams about or remembers their first love this book is a great read. PS. For anyone familiar with literary terms, Edward is the perfect Byronic hero."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me fall in love again!","review":"This book awakened my long stilled heart and reminded me of the joy of falling helplessly in love. Even though I am in my 50's, I could clearly relate to the characters. I once again felt passion by falling in love with Edward. I think the mass hysteria preceding the movie's release says volumes about the book and its affect on the hearts of women around the world. Millions of women around the world fell in love again through Bella's eyes. What a powerful wonderful emotion to feel again!

Yes, the series was a quick read. Yes, it is very engaging & the characters are engrossing. Yes, it is YA, BUT that was neither here nor there as far as good reads are concerned.

I love Stephenie for writing them! You are amazing, and please don't let all the negativity over BD and the illegal release of Midnight Sun get you down. Their are still loyal fans that would never disrespect you. I eagerly anticipate Midnight Sun!!Anyways, Stephenie Meyer has this ability to bring her characters to life, and I actually feel like I am Bella when I am reading Twilight.

It took almost 400 pages of reading for anything of significance to happen. The author goes into painstaking detail about every little thing. If all the dribble were edited out, the book probably could have been 150 pages. The characters were not interesting. The story drags. There is very little vampire activity overall.Just not entertaining or enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Story and No Command of the English Language","review":"I found this novel very frustrating. The story starts out promisingly enough but it quickly turns into something boring and lame. And, to add insult to injury, it is not even written in English, but in some kind of pseudo-English slang in which the rules of grammar have been tossed out the window. For example, Stephenie Meyer has an irritating habit of using \\"who\\" instead of \\"whom\\", even in places where the missing \\"m\\" is not only grammatically incorrect but also rhythmically jarring, as in the case of \\"who I would have hated anyway\\". Maybe somebody should give she English lessons so that her could learn the difference between subjects and objects."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a bloody soap opera!","review":"The series of which this book is a part reads as a twisted soap opera. The heroine likes cuddling up to a stone hard, un-dead, icy-skinned, but somehow attractive guy that no one, including her father and the population of the town where they live, seems to notice is just a bit unusual. The story probably appeals to pre-teen/early teen girls who are intrigued by the bad boys in their crowd. The author passes on the opportunity to address the several analogous social issues that could give interesting depth to the novel, for instance: to accept (or not) the outcasts among us, moral justification for morally unacceptable acts, or the attraction to danger suffered by many of our young people. This book does not share insight, nor is it of a quality to warrant purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Love Story Twist","review":"Twilight is really a love story, not a novel about vampires. The author mixes the two worlds so effectively, it's hard to distinguish the difference. Instead of distracting the reader from a traditional love saga, the overarching vampire storylines and mysteries adds depth to the intensity shared between the two main characters. Looking forward to reading the other books in this series.

Twilight is my favorite book out of the four because thats were the whole saga began and the following books are just as amazing. Just waiting for the movie --December 12,2008.

I was so excited when it was touted as the new \\"Harry Potter\\". Ummm...I wonder if the people that said that actually read the book.First off, the plot is rather flimsy. Meyer takes up a good chunk of the book to write an extremely sappy love story between Edward and Bella and throws in some bad vamps in the end to further emphasize how much Edward and Bella love each other. It's more teen romance than it is vampire fiction. There wasn't even a fight scene between the bad vamp and Edward.Additionally, it irks me that Bella is so stupid and helpless. She's also very insensitive and selfish. If this is supposed to be geared towards a younger audience, what type of message is Meyer sending?Ugh, this novel was indeed an easy read since there was absolutely no meat to it.

This is unfortunate, but I can see traits shared by my fifteen year old daughter and some of her friends. Second, I cannot stand the sparkly vampire thing. The author appears to have did very little research on vampire lore. In my opinion if she wanted to make an undead creature sparkle in the sunlight, she should not have called it a vampire.If vampires are your thing, I suggest finding a diffrent book.

If Ms. Meyer had wanted something that sparkled, she could have made Edward and his family fairies, or some other kind of magical creature. And you can't have vampires without fangs. Period.Bella Swan is nothing more than a Mary Sue. She is a cardboard character with no spine, and to have guys falling over one another for her is something that anyone can see in a bad Mary Sue fanfiction. And Edward... oh god, how many times can he be described? Meyer/Bella goes on and on and on and ON AND ON AND ON about how handsome/beautiful Edward is.Of course, Edward himself is also a flat character. All he has going for him is his looks. That's all. His behavior and speech is nonsense. he keeps telling Bella to stay away from him yet he won't leave her alone.Doesn't anyone wonder why a group of vampires is in highschool?After I read about Edward's arms being described as 'scintillating', I couldn't take it any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's like bad fanfiction","review":"This book was absolutely deplorable.

But honestly im more of a fan of soft cover because i find them more comfortable to read but this was such a good book that i wanted it to be as durable as possible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST READ!!!","review":"This is undoubtedly one of the best books I have ever read--it started a passion for reading all over again, I hadn't read anything better than the Harry Potter books until I read this. It is a MUST READ for anyone who is a teenager or still feels young!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good as everyone told me it was","review":"I really like this book. It was about the desire to be with each other without the sex involved. I kept wanting to read on and ordered the next book. Hope it comes today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book - Excellent Series","review":"This book is excellent, the only problem is that once you read this one, you have to get the other three to find out what happens next; and it still leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"I was kind of hesitant to buy the book due to all the fuss, and having been a reader of the Anne Rice's Vamire Chronicles I was afraid I would be disappointed. I was not. This is young adult fiction to be sure but it was fun, and was not just a rehash of the same old vampire myths. It is first love but with a vampire. It does lack the richness of Anne Rice's writing but it was fun and entertaing which is why I read fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A series worth the read","review":"I think this is my new favortie book. I was a skeptic when it was recommended to me by a friend who said she was the new JK Rowling. I am also a big Anne Rice fan, but I found Twilight more enjoyable since Stephenie Meyer is a more direct author. Anne Rice sometimes gets carried away in her descriptions. Ms. Meyer put a lot of emotion into Bella in this book and the read is absolutely worth it. It is a more of a romance than anything else though, so people who do not like the mush may want to look elsewhere for their next read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Twilight Series","review":"I am a late-blooming fan of the Twilight series. I happened to catch the first movie on satellite about six months ago and became very interested in the storyline. Meyer definitely writes in a linear, story-telling fashion, which is perfect for the overall story. Her descriptions of teen love and angst, along with the whole vampire motif, made me truly feel what was going on for both Bella and Edward. And I'm not even close to being a teenager anymore. If you like vampire stories and just enjoy a good read that takes you out of your own life for a while, I would highly recommend this book. And that goes for any age group."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful for a not-YA reader","review":"My son was reading this in his 8th grade English AP class and thought I would like it... and boy, did I! I read it in one sitting basically, and completely devoured it.We care about Bella and Edward, we want them to be happy, yet circumstances are at an impasse as to whether they CAN be together.DOn't miss it, totally engrossing even for adults!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I cannot put into words how awesome this book including the entire series was. I have not read a book in over 10 years and when my sister suggested I bring it along on my cruise to read on the airplane, ship etc. I laughed telling her I was not into the vampire thing, but took the book to humor her more less. Well let's just say I finished the book by day 2 of my 7-day trip and became a mad women in search of book 2. It was quite frightening my cruise mates might add on my behavior every time we pulled into port and the book could not be found. I was reading to bite someone myself LOL! This series has inspired me to start reading again.PS would you believe I finally found the second book in the airport for my trip home. Finished the series in 2 weeks time -- read it you won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"I started reading this book recently on a trip to Portland, Oregon and I could not put it down. I know it was written for young teens, but I think adults will enjoy it as well. The main characters, Edward and Bella, are mature beyond their years and their love story is heartwrenching and sweet all at the same time. The storyline is well written and a nice twist on the vampire genre. I was so intrigued by the setting where the story takes place (Forks, Washington) that after I read the book, I looked online and was amazed to discover that Forks is a real place and Ms. Meyer's vivid descriptions couldn't have been any better than what I had imagined it to look like. The storyline will keep you hooked from beginning to end. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read in a long, long time.","review":"I was extremely hesitant to read this, since I'm 21 and thought it was a teenage thing, but my friends literally dragged me to the bookstore, and I read the whole book in a few hours. Yes, there is a werewolf and vampire love triangle. Sounds kind-of farfetched, I'll agree. Yes, Bella is whiny and sometimes nauseatingly infatuated with Edward. All in all though, kudos to Stephenie Meyer for getting me to read again! This is the best book of the three. Can't wait for August 2nd."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing in SO many ways","review":"I honestly don't know how this novel (hah) got such a high rating when the \\"most helpful\\" reviews are the one-star ones. Read those, I agree with every single one of them.I read it, and after finishing it I was hoping with all my heart that it was a Young Adult novel instead of one targeted at those with a more mature palette. HOWEVER. I think the author should give our younger readers more credit than she gives, and give them a real story, real characters, real anything. Imagination would be nice. Even the end \\"climax\\" fight was such a cop-out, I mean, come ON. If you must read it, then do so. Just borrow it though. Save your money for a latte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible and disappointing","review":"This has to be the worst book I have ever read. I picked it up because so many people were raving about it. Now I see that it is nothing more then a mary-sue fanfiction published to make emo, sexually repressed, immature girls orgasm. It really is nothing more then this authors wet dream gone wild. If you are a parent looking for a good book for your child this is not it. If you are someone looking for a bit of light reading, this is not it. If you are someone wanting to read a book with amazing characters, good story line, and an awesome twist!!!!...this is not it. This book is to juvenal for adults and to adult for the target reading group. If I could, I would have geven this book zero stars.I returned the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh - not worthy of the attention it's received","review":"My daughter recommended this book and I did read it. It seems ridiculous to me that this book is so popular. I ended up skipping all the staring, glaring, growling and generally unimaginative text, as it became repetitive and dull. I found neither character to be likeable or sympathetic and kept hoping Bella would get eaten. There might have been some interesting moments, for instance when Edward told how he became a vampire. I wished there was more about that part, but vampires seem to conveniently forget their human past. Also, I couldn't figure out how Bella could love a cold dead \\"thing\\" and why Edward loved Bella, a selfish, vapid, dull teenager 90 years or so younger than himself except that to him she smelled like a pork chop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping.","review":"Gripping. Stephanie Myers has managed to put a whole new twist in the vampire-mortal love story. Fast-paced, surprising, and enthralling, Myers has created an addicting story set in a completely real world. The heroine is spunky but oh-so likeable (and easy to identify with) while the hero is devastatingly alluring yet tormented. What other ingredients could you possibly need? I highly recommend this book (and its sequel--as if you'll be able to help yourself after reading Twilight) to any fans of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, paranormal romance, vampire stories, or romance fans in general. Trust me, you're in for a delicious treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage. And I don't mean the band.","review":"This book was simply unenjoyable. Bella faints constantly, judges people based entirely upon appearance, and whines like there's no tomorrow, yet everyone in the book loves her anyway.Now, I'm not going to type up page after page after page of why this book is \\"sooo awful!\\", so instead I'm just going to recommend a website, a certain TwilightSucks.com? It's a critique site that offers some calm and rational discussion of the negative points of the book.Basically, though, this book is just bad. Not \\"Silk and Steel\\"-level bad, but pretty bad all the same.And if you don't know what \\"Silk and Steel\\" is, consider yourself blessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Adult Readers","review":"I want to start this review by saying my neice loves this book.I often enjoy YA fiction myself so I picked up a copy to read. It was dreadful and I enjoyed Harry Potter.The plot drags on forever without anything happening.The color of his eyes are repeated so many times I want poke out my own.I got tired of reading 'he said, she said, she mumbled'. Does the writer have to tell who says every moment of dialogue?What saves the book is that it has a certain wistfulness in the characters that appeals to the teen set.The movie doesn't hurt either.However, for a book lover or a writer, this book is just a stinker.I think with some re-writing and some vamping up of the plot, it could have been great for readers of all ages. Right now, I can't imagine anyone over 19 dragging themselves through the boredom of reading it.It's okay but not spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"This got published?","review":"Let's say that you can ignore the rampant sexism in this book. That you can further ignore Meyer writing in all the Mormon crackpottery officially condemned by the church. That you can let slide the painfully childish plot and unlikeable main characters. There still remains one simple fact: this is one of the most painfully badly-written pieces of published writing I have ever had the misfortune of coming across.I've scored 9th-grade essays that tortured the English language significantly less. Her editor should be shot; maybe then he'd do a better job.It makes me shudder to think about what the manuscripts must have looked like before editing. I can only conclude that Meyer has the IQ of a leek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why does Bella have to be SOOOO pathetic?","review":"Seriously? What is all the fuss about? Her writing is mediocre at best and the story is as old as time. Why not write Bella as strong and independent instead of sniveling little girl who can't walk without a man swooping in to protect her?Stephanie Meyer should be ashamed as woman to write such a pathetic female character and have the nerve to call her a heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm mystified by the hype ...","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews before I wasted money downloading this \\"book.\\" After hearing rave reviews from, literally, women of all ages, I downloaded Twilight onto my Kindle and eagerly started to read it. Sad to say, I'm nearly done, and it hasn't gotten any better. But I'm stubborn and I'll finish it. The characters make no sense: Bella is shy and clumsy but she attracts this hot male vampire guy, who's been around for over 100 years, because of her SMELL? Come on! I was so so disappointed because I was looking forward to reading a series that would keep me hooked. I've waded through Lord of the Rings over 20 times. There is absolutely no way that I will finish the series. Don't read this book. It's awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Combined review - daughters...","review":"I just thought I'd summarize my daughters' reviews of this series for other Dad's out there. Having not read the book, I'll just submit their comments which I just heard recently when they told me the movie was coming out as this is apparently a popular book series.In a nutshell, my 15 year old thought the main girl character was \\"stupid\\" and \\"useless\\". She thought the story was \\"OK\\". On the other hand she hopes the movie is good and will see it because her friends will, and she would like to at least participate in coversations about the movie.My 13 year old thought the books were slightly better then just OK, but also thought the lead girl was \\"stupid\\" and \\"weak\\". She liked the movie well enough, but thought the girl, again, had nothing to say.Hey, I'm a guy and father and I'll never see the movie or read the books, so I'm just passing on my kids' reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to Literature","review":"And that's really all I have to say. This book was a huge disappointment for all I heard about it, completely with dismal one dimensional characters and a loose plot and complete sexism. Belle is a complete moron and I figured if I read one more word about how 'perfect' Edward Cullen is, I was going to just set the book on fire.A mockery of literature. I can't believe this got published and became popular when there are millions of better things that could've been in it's place that didn't absolutely suck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"Blah! One of the worst things I've ever read. Vampires should not sparkle! Fluffy and trite. Sad that this will be the way most young people will be introduced to vampire literature. They will think that this is the norm, while ignoring true great vampire novels like \\"Interview With The Vampire,\\" \\"Depraved Blood: The Young Blood Suckers Series\\" and Poppy Z Brite's \\"Lost Souls.\\" I do enjoy the shirtless wolf boy in the movies :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!","review":"I couldn't even finish got tired of nothing happening,but Bella complaing.Bella is a completely unlikable character and Edward isn't any better.

Again, not in a good way. This book is so bad that its funny, very, very funny. Bella Swan is the most useless, whiny, unhelpful loser that I have ever had the misfortune to read about and I don't even know why this is called a young adult fantasy novel, because A. I really doubt that this classifies as a novel and B. I seriously doubt that a toddler would believe this dribble! I found myself in stitches in some parts of this book; its so unbelievably bad! I mean Edward is such an brooding weirdo that I cannot believe tha Bella, or the rest of the Cullen troupe, is still around! Personally I say forgo this book and read the reviews instead; they are hilarious, so true and beliavable! So unlike the actual book!P.S. This review was probably more expressive than the entire series.

All the hype but a no go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cade B","review":"If you are tired of the old fashion love story and are ready to read something that will genuinely spark your interest, then this book is for you! Twilight takes you through a roller coaster of emotions, especially since this love story is like none you have ever heard of. Being in love with a vampire is something that you don't always see in what people define as a romantic. However, after reading this book you too will reconsider what you define as \\"love\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Love Story","review":"So after many years of prodding from my friends, I finally have decided to read the Twilight Series. I just finished book 1 and I am hooked! I didn't think I would be into the vampire thing at all...but Edward Cullen's character is so sweet and so in love that by the time you find out he's a vampire, it doesn't even matter. If you've waited too long to dive into this saga like I did, don't put it off any more. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"I heard about this series by Stephanie Meyers from a friend so I ordered Twilight and New Moon just to see if they were as good as my friend said they were. I was not disappointed!! I read the first two books in in a matter of days - they were that great! I ordered the last two books in the series before I finished New Moon and I couldn't wait for them to arrive. These books are thick but they are an easy read that you will not be able to put down. I think I'm in love with Edward & I'll bet I'm not the only one - Bella would not be happy to hear this, I'm sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of a romance novel, but still good.","review":"This book was pretty good. I finished it in two days. However, I did feel it was more of a romance novel than a vampire story. I haven't read a vampire book in years, but a friend recommended this book to me. She claimed it was incredible. I don't know if I would agree with her now that I read it, but it was still good. It starts off really slow, but it picks up after Bella and Edward finally speak to each other. It's not the best vampire book I ever read. Edward is your typical novel vampire. He's drop dead gorgeous, doesn't want to be a vampire, and falls madly in love with a human. It's nothing I haven't read before, but it interested me enough to read the next book in the series. The vampire aspect of this book was just ok for me. I wasn't blown away, but Edward and Bella as a couple were captivating enough to make me want to read more."},{"rating":"2","title":"It captured me and would not let go","review":"I'm just shy of age 30 and I wasn't sure if I would actually like this book.Quite Simply - I could not put it down. The characters reached in and grabbed me and would not let go. I read this book in about two days and longed for book two to know what would happen.I really don't think a book has captured me quite like this one ... and I've read a lot of books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Series!!","review":"This book and the subsequent 2 books were an amazing series. Very quick reads - I read them all within a week and a half. I can't wait for the next one to come out. It's a very different perception of vampires and werewolves, I highly recommend the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"Twlight: An amazing love story about a girl who loves a boy, not knowing what he really is. This story is a coming of age imaginative love story about what it is like to be in love with someone who isn't quite human but not exactly a beast. Bella moves to the small town of Forks Washington from the big town of Phoenix Arizona, she does this so her mom can go with her new husband on tour. When Bella moved to Forks she never knew what she would meet the love of her life, and become involved with a coven of \\"vegetarian\\" Vampires.

ARE YOU SERIOUS WOMAN?How could anyone think these books are good?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Best Vampire Tale!","review":"Let me start by saying I love horror movies, but I'm not a huge paranormal romance/vampire novel fan. The only reason I bought this book was because I am a big reader and after having seen this book on the shelf where all the top picks sit for well over half a year, and I figured that it might be worth a gamble. I was astounded at how well I loved this book and immediately set out to purchase the other 2; I finished all three in less than a week and am now out of luck until the 4th one comes out sometime this fall. I am also eagerly awaiting the Twilight film set to hit theatre in the fall as well. This book is a must read for anyone who likes to read at all! I never knew I could enjoy a vampire teen novel sooo much, I surrender to Stephanie Meyer's superior writing skill-she is a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"why aren't there more stars??","review":"I would give this novel 10 stars if I could. I was walking through my local B&N; store when the cover caught my eye. I read the frist sentence on the back cover and purchased it on a whim. I sat it aside and didn't think of it again for a few weeks. Then after picking it up and turning the first page I was captured in the story of Bella Swan. Upon finishing it I was saddened that I didn't have the next installment in this series.Stephenie Meyer's writing has a smoothness and flow that completely wraps you in the lives of those on the pages.I recomend this book for both teens and adults. You will be captured by Bella, Edward and the rest of the Cullens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight, book1","review":"A modern-day romance with the theme of Romeo and Juliet.

How is it possible for anyone to give in to this horrible level of abuse to the English language. The whole thing may as well be written in 133tspeak. How often can we change tenses?

The whole saga sucks you in and doesn't let go!","review":"I have read the entire series and loved each and every book. I have to be honest, before this book I've never read an entire book in my life(I'm 22), not even in school or college for a book report. I hated to read, but I LOVE STEPHENIE MEYERS work! It's so REAL and you get to know the characters as if they were real. I recommend this book, I recommend the entire series. Even if you don't like the paranormal aspect you will still love the adventure and the love story. I cried, laughed and carried them everywhere I went so if I had a free minute I could read some more. Read them, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is absolutely abhorred.

The dialogue is drawn out, redundant, and quite boring. i suppose there is an interesting twist to the story but it wasn't enough to get me to finish the book. I tried to plod on given all the hype but began to dread reading more of it, so couldn't make it past the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly written","review":"After all the hype I decided to read the book before seeing the movie, following many recommendations. It was so badly written I stopped after Chapter 6. Perhaps some tween just learning about love and obsession might enjoy it, but anyone older will see it's written worse than that tween's own attempt.The movie, at least, had gorgeous actors, and unrealized physicality, so skip the book and see the movie if you're one of the few who have not, but don't waste your time with the book. (Read one chapter of any Harry Potter to see how good young adult writing sounds.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"144 positive reviews - and they're right!","review":"This time the readers got it right. This is a book well worth reading and an absolute MUST for fans of themes revolving around vampires. Buffy fans should be delighted by this one as well.By the way, don't be put off by the fact that it was written for the Young Adult crowd. It has plenty to engage any adult reader as well, from romance, bittersweet moments and, of course, the dilemna of vampire meets human, including romance and danger.THere are also two competing vampire \\"clans\\" leading to moments of great suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":":D","review":":D BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!!!!!

I did finish it but regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"adult review","review":"Twilight is 300 pages of foreplay, and 100 pages of vampire chase mystery. Meyers is very good at writing about sexual tension, and there is no objectionable sexual content (for young readers) because they never get past first base. Bella is a hero because she is willing to make sacrifices to save those she loves. Unfortunately, her view of love is not as mature. This is more of a problem in book 2 than book 1, where infatuation is still the theme, rather than the sharing of common interests which should be the basis of commitment. It's a good, simple, read. It is enjoyable fiction. I wish Meyer had more to teach about infatuation vs love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute crap","review":"I tried to listen to this on audio book, and had to give up less than halfway through. It is very, _very_ poorly written. There is no plot at all. Nothing ever happens, there is no tension to pull the reader through the book, and one could drown with the amount of pointless angst the book has. In addition, the main character is made utterly unsympathetic by her lack of morals (e.g., her manipulation of Jacob), whining and selfishness. Wikipedia's four paragraph summary writes the \\"plot\\" of this book better than Stephanie Meyer does, and that's sad. Saying that the book is meant for young adults is no savior for this book; even as a teenager, I would have recognized its lack of merit.Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It only gets better.","review":"You definitely have to read this one first. Once you have let me know if you agree with the casting of the movie. My guess is NOT. Edward is downright ugly, and the wigs and dye jobs .... I scoff and vomit simultaneously. But the book is great. I dare you NOT to get hooked. It only gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best I have ever read","review":"This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. I found it to be entertaining on top of well written. I was hooked almost from the get go. I did have a problem with the instant love that happened between Edward and Bella. I thought that it was a bit rushed. The plot was a little thin in some areas, but it was hardly noticable. There was also a little too much in depth conversation and high school chit chat but this is a Young Adult book so I guess I have to take it for what it is.I found the characters to be well developed and decribed. The good thing about the book is that all the other supporting characters had good descriptions as well.This was a fantastic book I recommend it to people of every age."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped reading on page 23 ...","review":"This is the sentence that made me give up on the book: \\"When we entered the classroom, Angela went to sit at a black-topped lab table exactly like the ones I was used to.\\"For the love of God. *That* is the making of a bestseller? That sentence would get torn apart in any fiction-writing class.I recognize that I am not part of this book's target audience, but nor was I the target audience for the Harry Potter series or A Series of Unfortunate Events, and I loved ever volume in each of them.Kudos to the marketing team behind this book and all that came after it. But I wish kids were reading - and aspiring to - better writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish someone would've told me...","review":"That this is primarily a romance novel for young women more than anything else. Sure, there's vampires, but they're not the main focus of the book; the \\"doomed\\" relationship is. I read the book on a recommendation from a female friend thinking it was mainly a vampire book. I wish she would've told me it wasn't. Guys, do not read this book. It will take me weeks to recover the testerone lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for good vampire fiction (as if there existed nonfiction)","review":"I will not bore you with complaining about the plot or lack there of. In fact that isn't even the largest gripe I have with this novel. Simply put, the writing is absolute dribble, in fact I'm sure that a real 17 year old in love with a vampire could have told her tale better. The entire book read like a really long (and especially poorly written) teen magazine article.I'm glad that so many people find this novel readable, but I recommend Mary Downing Hahn -I originally wrote Mary Higgins Clark, two many middle named marys- (Look for me by Moonlight), Bram Stoker's Dracula, or Nabokov's Lolita if you are looking for the forbidden love fantasy.I apologize for being such a lit snob, but I just was so disappointed with this book after loving the vampire romance genre as a teen and I want others to enjoy the good this genre has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A simple and overrated book.","review":"I was skeptical about reading Twilight because of all of they hype, but the book itself was an easy read. It was interesting, yes. However, Bella is a poorly developed protagonist, with what I felt was somewhat of an odd personality change towards the end of the novel, not caused by any of the events leading up to it.Edward and the Cullens family, however, are interesting characters, with much more depth than Bella, but as they are not the characters who's point of view is being used, the book was a bit frusterating.As I said before, the book was an easy read, but this could've been because of the way the plot seemed to be rushed.All in all, the topic of vampires has been done to death, and there is no reason that this book is considered so great in comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I read the first part of this novel 4 days ago and I've already forgotten the plot and storyline for most of the book. That just gives you an idea of how awful I thought it was. And then I remembered who the intended audience for this book was - young teens and so I gave this book 2 stars instead of one. The characters, from Bella to Edward are shallow and empty. They lack the richness of some other similarly themed books I've read. Don't expect to find anything on the level of Anne Rice here, because her writing in this book is very generic and formulaic as far as vampire romance novels go and I feel Twilight has been done in similar fashion zillions of times over. I was looking for fresh perspective on vampire romances and would have been satisfied with just a great set of characters but instead I just came up bored and yawning after a few hours of reading. I really did feel like everything i read was predictable. I really don't understand why so many people like this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"twilight","review":"this novel grips its readers and takes them to another world. once you pick it up/ you wont be able to put it down until youve read it multiple times. fantastic trilogy! must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very readable and rereadable","review":"I bought this about what, a year or two ago. My niece has read it and she's a fan, as am I. I mean, it's simple, but like Ringo Starr's drumming, beneath the simplicity lies something deep and profound. Meaning, it's not as simple as it looks. Jimmy Page said the roots of Led Zeppelin's music are all in the first album. Although I very much prefer Led Zeppelin II, I have to agree that the roots of New Moon and Eclipse - from Jacob Black's legends to Rosalie Hale's origin, they are all there in Twilight. Simple yet heavy, romantic but not perverse, and the occasional gore served with conscience and wit...if I may say so. ****. Top rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 1 is more than enough","review":"Too sappy & sensual - leave out the middle 200 pages and my criticism might be lessened. Shallow character development to the point that I had to press through the boredom. (Adolescent literature doesn't have to be shallow to be at the targeted reading level.) Of all the wonderful pieces of literature out there - classics, and modern - I can't help but feel sad that young ladies across the world (observed first-hand at my middle school) are so enamored by a story with such repetition in word usage, such an inconsequential story line, and such unnecessary sensuality. Somehow, I get the feeling that Meyers is capable of better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack. . .","review":"I wanted to know what all the hype was about . . . the idea of Vampire Romance intrigues me, but this is so much Romance that the Vampire becomes an after-thought. Yes, Edward is perfect and Bella is smitten, but we can have a little adventure here, can't we? About page 350 the adventure heats up - excitement! A rival, evil vampire! And then Bella gets knocked out of the action so we don't even get to see the climactic battle. Fine for romance novel lovers who are too timid for the vampire/fantasy genre, but if you like vampires and werewolves, I'd suggest Patricia Briggs instead. . . or the TV series \\"Moonlight.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Millenium Snow revisited, but badly","review":"Check out the manga \\"Millenium Snow\\" written by Bisco Hatori. You might notice some similarities to \\"Twilight\\".Similarities such as; the heroine has both a vampire and a werewolf after her, the vampire saves her life near the beginning of the story, and the vampire sparkles like diamonds. The plot premise is pretty much the same. The heroine ends up choosing the vampire over the werewolf, maybe because this vampire is also choosy about his diet.One way in which the books are different is that \\"Millenium Snow\\" was published much earlier than \\"Twilight\\". Is it possible Ms. Meyer's now-famous dream of vampires in a shojo-sparkle infested meadow was inspired by a japanese graphic novel? Nah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing needs more verve","review":"I'l admit the cover attracted me, because it looked like a retold fairy tale. But after reading the first boring, purely utillitarian sentence, I wanted to but the book down. My sister insisted I read on. I got halfway before I couldn't take any more of the asinine dialogue tags. Forks must be full of grimacing, smirking people. Though the dialogue itself was not bad, sometimes even funny, the heroine, for being styled 'smart', was, in fact dumb, dumb, dumb, clueless, etc. In short, the Ms. Meyers should write screenplays, not books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"This book is flat. Flat boring!There is nothing wrong with a simple teen romance plot (and it is a very simple plot) if the author has the characters to support it. Twilight does not. The characters are one dimensional and sexist. Appearently Meyer's believes that if the Herion (who is 15!) doesn't inspire lust in every male creature she encounters then she's not interesting enough to be the lead. Also, that all males who are not beautiful \\"like diamonds\\" than its ok to treat them like lesser beings and those who are beautiful should be forgiven of all sins. Same for the girls. All characters seem very vain and shallow, but mostly boring.I have read a lot of books and can honestly say this one is the worst I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horriblely written fanfiction that somehow got published.","review":"After 500 pages of the main character, Bella, whining about how unperfect she is (she is beautiful and smart by the way) and how absolutely perfect her love interest is, Edward, I was relieved to finally close the book for good and trash the thing. From sparkly vampires to whiney Mary-Sues this crappy somehow-got-published-fanfiction is a definately must-skip.

Just a whole lot of pretty sparkly vampires (Since when did they sparkle?) who angst a lot, and a shallow self-obsessed teenager who angsts even more, and a relationship that is based solely on physical characteristics, which is not what true love is about.It makes a good beach read, but it's nothing more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has many practical uses!","review":"1.Paper airplanes2.Toilet paper3.Kindling4.Origami5.Booster seat6.Spit-wad ammo7.Confetti8.Weapon for inflicting paper cuts9.Paper snowflakes10.Papier macheThat's just to name a few!

The plot is a clear rip from the Sookie Stackhouse books, extremely clich�� ending, and very dry characters.

This is a book that is nothing more than literary trash from a talentless writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand what the fuss is all about!","review":"I'm writing under my husband's name as this is his account. I bought this book because a few of my girl friends who are all over the age of 30 were talking about it. After reading it I felt like I wasted the $8 I spent on it. In my opinion it was just a silly vampire teen love story and I cannot imagine why anyone over the age of 21 would even like it. I can understand teenagers liking it but not older girls/women. For vampire tales I would much rather read and recommend Anne Rice whose writing is definitely more intelligent and less predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"So I see how everyone can love this book. I mean there's just so much going on, and it keeps you reading. I wanted to see what the big deal was so I read it. So as a Christian I was trying to see this book by others prospective and It was not happening. why would someone want to be in love with something so dark and evil? Why would she torture herself like that. Their love isn't even real. It's all sexual. They don't even have things in common. Why would you choose to live in a world like this. I know that this is the time where evil will look good, and good will look evil but yuck. People wrap themselves and get so deep into something that can take you to another place.

There are no redeeming qualities in this book, other than that the pseudo-author, I can't force myself to type \\"writer,\\" somehow stumbled blindly into something that a certain segment of the population wanted. I guess it was heavy unconsumated teenage panting with vampires. The settings are not well described, nor are the characters filled out.

No, I don't say this out of some sort of sadistic urge to bring down everyone who loves this book. I'm saying this because I feel physically compelled to: this is, by far, the worst book I've ever read. This is a terrible example of \\"love\\" for teenage girls and I am legitimately afraid of how it could influence a preteen reader in regards to the ways in which men should treat women. Edward is a misogynistic, loathsome monster. Bella is subordinate, refuses to think for herself, and completely dependent on his happiness. Sorry, this isn't true love. This is abuse. Essentially, if you choose to read Twilight, you're choosing to read a middle-aged woman's badly written wet dream. If you want a real romance, read Jane Eyre. Read Les Miserables. They're misogynistic because of the era, but at least the women think for themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUK","review":"Better and more positive fiction out there....parents should act responsiblly and investigate for themselves the message that this book REALLY sends to your daughters.

I could not put it down. The characters Bella and Edward seem realistic and the problems they face lifelike in a mythical arena. The main conflict is how do you deal with your first love and still balance your obligations to family and friends. The love story is well developed and with the right director, the story could be a wonderful movie or even a TV series.

In less than a week's time I am now enjoying book 3 of the Twilight series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After all the hype related to this book, I was anxious to read it. But what a disappointment. Without much interaction, the main character falls madly in love with a vampire---never mind that he could be dangerous, or the fact that she hardly knows him. I found no suspense in the story, nor truth to the characters--they were flat and lifeless. It's not a good mystery and it's not a good love story. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My extra special Collector's Edition","review":"First off I only read the paperback when I had seen the movie.

The entire story \\"ALL\\" the pages are upside down and backwards!! Yes you have to flip the book to the back and then turn it over!

After sacrificing her comfortable life with Mom and Mom's new hubby, Bella finds herself in dreaded Forks with her single dad, Chief Swan. She hates the cold. She hates the rain. But she find something she does like in the form of beautiful, brooding, and ever mysterious Edward Cullen. Problem is, he has a dire thirst for her blood. I love the tension this premise creates. I love how it allows Edward's strength, self-restraint, and sheer tenderness to come through in those pages. I was left thinking of this book and it's wonderful world for days, and dying to get my hands on the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyed it!","review":"I am a vampire fan. And its increasingly hard to find books of that sort that still have the old world vampire....the ancient ones. I'm not a fan of the sci-fi-super-hero-karate-jump-in-the-air-and-kick the bad guy to death type. So when I started this book I was relieved to find the sort of centuries old, romantic, vampire of the Anne Rice sort. And although it may be written in more of a light hearted manner that a teen could get into, I really enjoyed the characters and story. I found that also made it easier to just pick up and read anytime I had a few minutes. I didnt have to reacquaint myself with the whole story again to read. High school is hard enough when you go thru it yourself...and having two daughters who just completed that journey...I could relate to all the drama that goes on with the kids in the story. I just plain liked the book.....my only complaint was...that it ended. I went thru it so fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitley the BEST BOOK EVER!","review":"I initally borrowed this book from a friend of mine, and fell in love with it. I was (and still am not) a huge vampire fan, so I wan't sure if I would like it. I found myself rereading it... 5 times! I then bought New Moon and Twilight so I could enjoy them forever. It's one of the books I NEVER get tired of!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story With Bite","review":"I am sure by now you have heard of the Twilight craze. I read this book last Christmas from the recommendation of a friend and found myself loving this book. To truly enjoy this book, unplug yourself from everything you have ever heard. Pretend that there are no teenage girls obsessing over it. Heck, do not even tell anyone you are reading it if you must. That's how it happened for me. I had no idea that any craze had ever existed while I was reading. If I would have been as aware of the craze last year, I might have not read it, but I sure am glad I did.This book is a story of a forbidden love. Forbidden loves are all the better though. Bella Swan meets the man of everyone's dreams, Edward Cullen. Edward is a powerful vampire who is very reluctant to let himself love her. The tale of these two is something you should give a try. Again, disregard everything you have ever heard. Walk into reading this with a fresh, open mind and see how you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read! But before I get tons of backlash, let me add that I really like the four books in general. The writing and the plot of Book 1 was so juvenile! However as you go on through each book it does get better. I was so sick of Bella and Edward telling each other \\"I love you\\" every few pages.I continued to read the other books in the series under pressure of my friends and was surprised that I actually liked the 3rd and 4rth book. Those two were actually worth laboring through this one and the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe next time...","review":"I will admit I did enjoy this book, to an extent. It was the only book of the series that I enjoyed because it focused on their relationship. However she loses that focus and takes no risks in the series.

My comments go much more in depth in the following book reviews because they get worse and worse in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expcted more","review":"Every one told me to read this book . What a waste of my time. It was sooooooo boring and flat.After many good comments. I thought it was a romance I mean a vampire almost killing her .

Very well written and hard to put down once you start!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful start to an interesting new series!","review":"I don't read first person books, they just bore me too easily and I'm never able to get into the story, but Twilight was different. Everyone around me was reading this book and raving about it, so i thought 'what the heck, i'll give it a shot' and i'm glad i did.I was pulled into the story right from the beginning and found i couldn't put it down until i was done. It had a different twist than the average vampire novel and i liked that it wasn't typical (typical is just plain boring).If you enjoy a good romance, or just want something interesting to read that will grab your attention and hold it until the end, read Twilight, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining for all ages","review":"This is a great read for many ages.

However, from the moment I started reading it, hours would pass before I was even able to look up from it! This book is a beautifully written story that provokes the danger and secretive beauty of forbidden love. The writing is so vivid that even within the first few pages, you will connect with the characters and find yourself trembling with anticipation of what will happen next. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who loves intriguing tales with a little twist. Wonderful...please give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Wow pretty much sums up the whole book. A very good wow. Easily one of the best series I've ever read. I am in love with anything vampire related...if its good. There are SO many horrible vampire stories and movies out there, it's hard to find decent ones, nevertheless one that is AMAZING! Please, if you like love stories or vampire stories, please read this series. Both books are incredibly touching and edgy. Everything an excellent vampire novel should be. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"I was given the book to read by a friend with similar reading taste. I have never been more disappointed. In a nut shell the book is a bland one dimensional story. It is a high school junior's story and has all the self focus of that age. Where is the background and detail for the supporting characters? Everything beyond Bella's immediate focus remain no more than card board cut outs, forgetable. When Bella has to go on the run no mention is made of what Edward, Emmet and Carlise are going through, or what Rosalie and Esme have to do to evade Charlotte? And how self serving is her whining about wanting to be a vampire with Edward since after all her mother has her own life and her dad is used to being alone? I have read short stories with more detail to paint a vivid picture in my mind, stories that I am still wrapping around in my thoughts days later. Days later all I think about with Twilight is that I wasted my time that could have been better used on the next book in my reading stack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes","review":"I appreciate a good story without worrying about what my teenage daughter is reading. Kudos to Stephanie Meyer, and thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series until you get to book 3!","review":"Parts 1 and 2 to this series were very addicting and I finished both in 4 days. However,once I got to book 3, I started becoming very annoyed with Bella. It gets a little old hearing how much Edward adores her and would \\"protect\\" her. Please. And she thinks she's so cool. I really like Jacob and I hope she ends up with him and not Edward. I did like both Bella and Edward a lot until I reached Book 3. I suppose they just started getting on my nerves after awhile. I'm sick of them both. Regardless, the series is still entertaining and even though I find myself rolling my eyes every now and then, I would recommend this series to anyone. I am halfway through with Book 3 now and look forward to Breaking Dawn. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in every way a book could lack","review":"At the risk of bodily harm and being disowned by a friend of mine who is fan I'm going to say that to compare this with Harry Potter series is an insult to J.K. Rowling to say the least. I tried to give this book a chance and it failed miserably. It was page after page boring narration and over description. The character development was poor to say the least and the story went nowhere. Bella's character was worse than a Mary Sue as she lack any substance or qualities fitting a main character/heroine. Edward is a parody of a vampire at best as I felt he either just moped or brooded around half the time or stalked Bella the other half. After fifteen pages I just wanted the book to end already. And to twilight fans, no I am not jealous of Stephanie Meyer and I don't think Stephen King is either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written, but I had a few issues","review":"I was drawn in at the beginning of the book with the way Meyer makes everyday tasks seem interesting. That was all that was interesting though. Bella and Edward weren't very pleasant characters. Bella is insecure and overly obsessive, Edward is brooding and not very friendly. If he is in love with Bella he certainly doesn't act like it. There didn't some to be much plot, girl falls in love with boy, boy says he is in love with girl, but it doesn't seem like it, then, all of the sudden there is danger and drama. It seemed a little contrived. I read through the entire book quickly because it was an easy read and it was well written, but the plot isn't really that special, it can be summed up in one or two sentences. There was no mystery, the action in it seemed to come out of no where for no reason. I will probably continue to read the series to see what happens, but if it continues to be so dry, I may quit."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give a negative star rating","review":"My ability to suspend my disbelief ended in the middle of this book. Usually I can finish any book, regardless of how bad it is, needless to say that did not happen here. If you are considering buying this book, borrow it from the library.If you know a girl who has read, or wants to read this book, have a discussion with her about abusive relationships. Find a Mercedes Lackey book and talk about the heroine in that book, compared with Bella. How they handle adversity differently, how they expect to be treated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the Hype","review":"I bought this book because of a recommendation by a local radio personality. The book went to #1 locally following her mention of it on the radio so I took the bait. BIG disappointment! This thing is soooo boring. I can't imagine why so many people love it so much. The characters have no depth and apparently nothing much going on in their lives, since so far, we've gone to school, gone shopping, gone to school, gone to the beach and daydreamed about how gorgeous the local vampire dude is and how great he smells. Hmmm...could have been the local football jock or any other \\"untouchable\\" popular, dangerous-type boy I guess, and it still would not have been interesting. I guess I could be too old for this book (over 40), or maybe I was hoping it would compare to the Anne Rice vampire novels (not even close) but I will not buy the other three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight - A Modern Day Fairy-Tale Romance","review":"I can understand why so many individuals don't like this book. It's hard to get into, I understand that. Romance novels aren't for everyone. However, I strongly suggest that readers give this book a chance. With or without its fellow brethren (there are three other books in the series), this book entices readers to follow along page after page. Any reader could follow the story line of, and be content with, only the first Twilight Saga book, though I highly suggest picking up the remaining three. And while the story may be written with an audience of teenage girls in mind, it delivers to both teenage and adult readers alike. I realize that this isn't the first novel of its kind on the market, but it does bring a fresh breath to the sub-genre of vampire romance novels, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it or hate it, you'll probably still read it.","review":"I've read many glorious reviews for this book and some pretty bad ones as well.

However, I am all for romance novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"eye - yi - eye!","review":"Here's the best way to get through this flaccid tale of young love: every time the word \\"eyes\\" appears, take a shot.

Take out all the teen introspection and endless descriptions of eyes, hair, faces, and hands, it would be half as long -- and that's a good thing! Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed","review":"I decided upon seeing the August release for the final book of the series, that maybe I should try this book. I was actually disappointed and not wholly pleased with the main character Bella. I thought she was whiny and angsty at the beginning. Yes I know she's a teenager but still I thought Stephanie Meyer would eventually have the character develop and become something more.I read the next book New Moon as well hoping well maybe Bella would develop in this one. Not really.Bottom line: If you enjoy paranormal fiction, its overall entertaining but you might feel like the author should kill the main character off"},{"rating":"2","title":"what can i say?","review":"this is the most AMAZING book! A lovestruck vampire? What more could you want? I didn't like Bella in the beginning because, to me, she spontaneously liked a mysterious guy for reason. What makes this book worthwhile is its ROMANCE! Its sweet, innocent, and death-defying love! Read it! I highly recommended for all teenage girls especially.

And the vampires aren't very scary","review":"I know this is a popular book, but I thought it was missing all the important elements of a vampire romance. The first 350 pages were all about who sits next to whom in the school cafeteria, and how to politely say no if you don't want to go to a dance.The last 150 pages were spent running away from a vampire fight that never really happened. Okay, it did happen, but it happened somewhere else, while the heroine was unconscious.My biggest complaint? Lack of angst. Nobody suffered. They talked about how some of them suffered in the past, but you didn't really feel it. The only feeling you got was of a bunch of overly calm high schoolers handling cafeteria politics.I wonder why such a bland book is getting such rave reviews, when there are so many more exciting ones available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not live up to the hype!","review":"I thought I would final read the series after hearing all the great reviews.

I'm just wondering what horrible thing is next that will come after twilight dies off (probably sooner then they think)its not too hard to see that Mrs. Meyer didn't have to think that hard to write the book..young innocent girl -> vampire falls in love with girl-> girl gets in trouble -> vampire saves girl -> all is well againI mean WOW.. really i read this same plot when i was 12 from internet stories.

I heard it was good, and decided to borrow one to check it out.It feels like I am the ONLY teenage girl that not only does not like the book/series, but absolutely hates it. There are many well-written reviews about this book here, and they can get more in-depth than I care to.Keeping it short:- Cliche and boring- Insult to human intelligence- Essentially an allusion to Mormonism (I can provide links to anyone who would like to read up on this)- Horrible plot holesJust a filler for the female Harry Potter fans that don't know what good fiction is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"This book was not only well written, the characters were relatable. In a weird way. Not the vampire thing obviously. But there personalities. The whole high school experience. Almost everything. It all starts when Bella moves to Forks WA to live with her dad. She hasn't spent much time with him over the years seeing how she lived in Phoenix with her mom. But during the summer she and her dad would spend some time together. When she arrives in Forks she almost instantly sees Edward Cullen. A very handsome stranger who she can't stop thinking about. As she slowly starts to get to know him, she just seems to like him even more. And at the same time, have more questions than she gets answers. The book is great.

(Some of them had read it in only one day!) I'm usually skeptical of books that are wildly popular, but I picked up a copy to read for myself. I was quickly drawn into the story; the characters were relatable, the setting was vivid, and Edward was irresistable. I especially liked the chapters that focused on the progression of Edward and Bella's unique and dangerous relationship. When the book moved toward its climax, I wished it could have stayed focused on them, but alas! A book (no matter how good and interesting the characters may be) must have a plot:) I found myself wishing that the people in the story were real.

I couldn't even finish it. The other 1-star (intelligent) reviewers here said enough about what was so wrong with this piece of crap (no plot, one-dimensional characters, the message it was sending to its young fans, etc.) but I still wanted to vent because I can't for the life of me understand how this was a NYT bestseller. Maybe I can try to understand how this appeals to those pre-teens whose heads are filled with girlish notions of romance and little else (because I'm hoping as they get older they'll grow out of it), but when I see those mothers who scream/rant/faint/drool alongside their 13-year old daughters like deranged lunatics at the young actors at these premieres and actually join fan clubs and are part of this craze that really makes me sick and sad. Meyer has no talent for writing but is a disturbed demented woman who should have these books shredded and crammed down her throat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book EVER","review":"I bought Twilight because almost everyone in my school is reading it and I thought if it's so popular then I should read it too. I was horribly mistaken, though, to think that it's as great as everyone says it is. The story was horrible, the characters, especially Bella, weren't well developed at all and very boring, and there were many parts in the book that didn't make sense. The fight scene was the most exciting part of the story, which is sad because it was the worst I've ever read in my life (there actually was no fighting, now that I think about it). I'm not even sure that I want to read the next three books if they're as horrible as the first one. It's very obvious what's going to happen in the end, anyways. I don't understand why the author kept the story going for so long and didn't just cut to the chase in the first or second book. The book had no plot or moral and oftentimes was advocating negetive things.

I read it to preview it for my own child. The themes of this book are not approproate for this age group, in my opinion.

To write a \\"saga\\" suggesting that a young woman's worth, importance, and uniqueness is solely based on the attention and obsession of an adoring male is horribly irresponsible and reprehensible.To suggest that the human will to survive is curbed by this tragic and abusive \\"love\\" isn't great fiction, it's a dangerous recreation of Shakespeare (which you most certainly are not Mrs. Meyer) for the viewing pleasure of an emotionally unsophisticated audience.You should be ashamed Stephanie Meyer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Admittedly this isn't the first time I read this.

The story fits in the genre of romance because it clearly shows that Bella Swan falls for a beautiful loving vampire, Edward. She ends up becoming really close to the vampire family and she is the only human who knows their secret. One example that shows that this is a romance novel for instance, is that Edward says \\"I love you\\" to Bella right after she gets bitten from another evil vampire. I think this story is an amazing love story between two different \\"people\\" whom we could never imagine being together. They both understand each other and are willing to do anything for one another even if it risks their lives. I totally recommend this book for romance fans.11th grade TJHS English student"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"This is one of the best books I have read recently. It tells the tale of Bella, who has recently changed schools, and Edward who never really showed any interest in anyone until she catches his eye. Very star crossed and angsty as you find out Edward is a vampire (been age 17 since the early 1900s) and really has to fight off his feelings for Bella. Tables are turned when a rogue vampire gets the same feelings for Bella and starts tracking her, Ed is forced to stay by her side. Although the characters are 17, the book will appeal to everyone. Ms Meyer really understands the age of her characters well, making them their age, but mature, perhaps this is why her readers span all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the read","review":"I'll keep this brief and simple. I've read Twilight and New Moon.I've read all the Harry Potter books and really enjoyed them. I'm WELL past my teen years but I thought I'd give the Twilight books a try. The stay-at-home moms in my neighborhood in their 30s and 40s loved them.I found the characters one dimensional and underdeveloped. I could not empathize with Bella. I thought her character was insipid. I could not imagine falling in love with Edward - Bella describes his breath and touch as icy.

When I first heard about this book and the author, I was very excited, but when I realized what it was about, I resisted reading it. Vampires? Ick. This was my first 'fantasy' read. The hype overcame me, however, and I relented. I finished the book in a matter of 48 hours! I stayed spellbound and thoroughly enthralled throughout the entire book, down to the very last page. It was a very good story with excellent character developments and visual descriptions. This was definitely not the old Bela Lugosi type of vampire story--it was very contemporary and intriguing. As for the fact that it is directed to young adults, I have to say that I never thought of it in that way, despite the characters being in high school. It was a suspenseful, entertaining book, with refreshingly little (maybe one) curse words or graphic sexual situations.

She begins as a teenager with all the self-consciousness, weaknesses, and foibles of a teen.

Back to main point-the book was great. It had everything necessary for a suspense filled, romantic tale. Edward was a little too possessive, Bella a little too mundane at times and some secondary characters, somewhat annoying. But I do admire Edward and Bella's devotion and love for one another.

Figured I'd give it a read before seeing it at the cinema. Unfortunately I think I need to be 20 years younger to appreciate this book fully. *sigh*The characters have no depth and are predictable. The writing style is not challenging at all... even for the intended age range. While some of the vampire lore concepts are an interested departure from the norm, it's not intriguing enough to save this book.In addition, some of the book club thought provoking questions at the end of the book mentioned that 'Twilight' was inspired by 'Pride & Prejudice'.

Twilight is a story of a high school girl who moves to a small town (from Phoenix) to live with her father. While at the new school she falls for a very pale gorgeous boy.

It was a horrible experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kayla's book review","review":"TWILIGHTStephenie Myers's Twilight is a romance with a twist. Bella Swan is just your average seventeen year old girl, who moves to the town of Forks, Washington with her father. She meets many friends including the mysterious Edward Cullen. She finds herself falling madly in love with him, but she also finds out a big secret: Edward Cullen is a vampire. She gets dragged into Edward's world of mythical creatures and danger. Bella's life will never be the same again.Twilight is a story with romance, action, adventure, and a little bit of horror. Twilight is just one out of four amazing books; there are also New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn. Stephenie Myers puts so much personality in her characters it's like Edward and Bella are telling you the story for themselves. I recommend this book to any body eleven and up especially if you like romance...and vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance novel with training wheels","review":"Apologies for the negative review, but this book simply isn't very good. Two main reasons:First, genre. I had heard this series called \\"the next Harry Potter\\", but about vampires. I was expecting any of action, adventure, fantasy, horror. It's none of those things: it's a bodice-ripping romance novel written for 13 year olds. What a boring genre. Bodice-rippers are useful for their titillation, but when written for young teens, only the dull exposition remains. It's Danielle Steele with training wheels, interesting only to girls who aren't quite ready for the books with Fabio covers.Second, characters. Every character in the book is perfect and without depth. Perfection is boring. Uncovering major character flaws and seeing how those flaws are dealt with allows characters to develop and grow over time. None of that here.I won't be reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book about vampires, how is that possible?","review":"I am only reviewing because I feel obligated to bring the average rating of this book down.

I'm ashamed for this book's editor.Oh, and did I mention that this book reads exactly like fanfiction written by fifteen year olds? It needs to be said."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is terrible","review":"This book is terrible. I truly regret purchasing this book. Stephenie Meyer's writing is amateur, mediocre at best. If you like plots with a lot of twists and surprises, then this book isn't for you. The plot here is very linear and boring. There's nothing really more to the story than \\"a girl and vampire falls in love\\". If you've read more than one vampire novel before \\"Twilight\\", then you'll understand how redundant and boring the plot is. The female protagonist, Bella, is a weak and shallow character. Besides loving Edward, there's seemingly nothing else to her. (By the way, her characteristic clumsiness is not charming but instead irritating) Furthermore, the intense and passionate love between Bella and Edward is hardly believable. All in all, save yourself the time and read something else. If you're very curious about this book, then wait for it at the library or borrow it from the friend. It is definitely not worth purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Step Back for Women Everywhere","review":"I suppose it's not Twilight that is such the step back. It's just a mediocre (at best) novel afterall. But its enormous success is disturbing to say the least. Could it be possible that women are still trapped by inequality in prisons of their own design? Fantasies that merging with a man, a God on earth, and trading freedom for security will result in a fully-lived and satisfying life?Anyone who reads Twilight and enjoys it should also read The Cinderella Complex by Colette Dowling. It's almost 30 years old and boy do I wish I could say it doesn't still hold true but the success of Twilight proves otherwise.Women must want to be saved and are apparently ready to give themselves up entirely at the prospect of protection from their own development.I'm so disappointed in us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edward is a silly cave man","review":"I don't like books about boyfriends that grab their girlfriends like rag dolls and put them in danger all the time.

I have reread the series multiple times and will continue to do so. I love these books! It is an easy read, but a consuming one. Once I start the book I become too engrossed to stop. This book is amazing dispite the at times choppy writing and wordy pages. If you have yet to read Stephanie Meyer I would recommend that you pick up Twilight."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is for Preteens.","review":"This book is for PreTeens. I did not realize that before I started reading. I read halfway through the book, and was bored to death. They talked more about high school chemistry class than vampires. The characters were made of cardboard. I finally gave up on it. If you have a preteen girl at home, she will love it, and the story is very PG so you do not have to worry about the content."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife's absession","review":"After my wife read this book, she continued to read the whole saga. She became obsessed. I came home to posters hung up on our walls, cardboard cut outs standing next to our bed, and cats named Edward and Bella. She went as far as buying a Volvo, without my consent. She changed her wardrobe and our home, then she went as far as trying to change me. She wanted me to become buff, memorize poetry, read minds, stay out of the sun, and be there to catch her when she fell. I tried my best to go along with this, but it was coming between us. I am a middle aged man with a beer belly, I am not a buff, pale young man. Once my wife realized I wasn't her Edward, she left me to go find an Edward for herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom fan","review":"Just like many other teens and moms, I enjoyed Bella and Edward's romance, that first love that always will linger with you. Edward is the perfect guy, 17, will never age, the maturity of a 100 yr old, and vampire handsome. What's not to love. It's fantasy and not reality, but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't help myself I loved it","review":"Ok yes it's cheesy and mushy. But it's a fun way to kill sometime with a melodramatic teen romance. As an adult woman, the only thing that is missing for me is actual sex...But then I guess it wouldn't be teen, rightSo listen don't kid yourself it's not the next American classic but it's fun sappy romance and we can all use allitle of that now and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Female Main charater ever.","review":"Bella takes the qualities about teenage girls that most of us dislike to the extreame. She is so comsumed by Edward that it is crippling, not a role modle for my daughter at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenominal!","review":"This book was absolutely phenominal. I enjoyed every single page. I recomend it to anyone who is a true fan of Vanpire stories. The only reason why I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, was because of the name. I feel that it should have been something different. But that takes nothing away from the story. I loved every chapter, and every page. I look forward to more great writing from this Author."},{"rating":"2","title":"For people that have seen the movie and are considering reading the books","review":"I am a 28 year old woman. I saw the movie when it came out and thought it was ok, there was something missing. However, I was intrigued by Edward and Bella's relationship. Like a fairy tale I would want to be a part of. Everyone kept telling me to read the books, they were much better than the movie. I gave in and loved the book! The movie is nothing in comparison to the book. The book is much more detailed, exspecially in describing the personal feelings of Bella toward Edward. There are \\"extended scenes\\" in the book not shown in the movie. The book has more \\"filling\\"! I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oddly compelling...","review":"This book is oddly compelling. I'm not a young adult, but I do read YA literature because I enjoy it, and so I can recommend books to my children (we're all voracious readers). Other reviewers have given enough details of the plot, so I won't go into that in this review. I just wanted to share that although I agree with other reviewers that this isn't the most well-written book I've ever read, and that it does tend to be a little too repetitive and \\"angsty\\", it still drew me into the story enough to care about the characters and read it to the end. I enjoyed it enough to immediately download New Moon as soon as I finished this one (I have a Kindle). My teens did the same - read through it in a day or two, and immediately asked for the second book in the series. I don't know what it is about these books - it just is. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Series","review":"I would like to start of by saying that the Twilight Series are the best books I've read in all my life. To most it might sound childish or what ever, but I can honestly say that this book has absolutely everything I am interested in as well as how I see certain things. Even though it is a fiction novel, the books has plenty of great points to it. I just wanted to give, you know, a high five, on this book. Its amazing. I recommend this book to 'anyone' who is looking to get away from what ever it is you do each day and into another world of mysteries, romance, action, comedy (in my opinion.), and much much more. GOOD JOB!! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"on the topic of restraint","review":"Better reviewers have identified problems with characterization, plot development and etc that I won't rehash here.I just wanted to comment on the theme of restraint. I may be reading into this too much, but I wonder if I am the only one who interpreted how SM uses the vampires' restraint from drinking human blood despite their inherent nature in craving it, as an analogy for advocating restraint of homosexual behavior? Obviously she is also advocating sexual restraint (before marriage) in general, but I feel like SM also alludes to homosexuality in the way that vampires have no choice that they crave human blood, but that they ultimately have a choice in whether or not to drink human blood despite their inclincations because it is the \\"moral\\" thing to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book....had concerns","review":"Yes, as you can read from the other reviews, Meyers style is not the greatest and a little amateurish but my concern was more so the message it gives young girls. At the risk of sounding preachy or on a soapbox, my concern was the main message in this book. Bella was a beautiful, intelligent, albeit sullen girl but she was willing to GIVE IT ALL UP...even her LIFE for a BOY! I know if I had a teenage girl, I would not want her to have that message! I did enjoy the book, but I am an adult with adult experiences but a young girl who may be without any guidance in her life, could possibly be influenced by Bella's choices. Parents: have a heart to heart with your daughters BEFORE and AFTER reading this book. It was so romantic that your daughters could try to seek their own Edward (hopefully not a bloodsucker who is constantly thinking about killing her). And yes, I do live in the same small town as Stephenie Meyer and have never run into her but would like to one day ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"...ugh another hype","review":"Well to start this out from the beginning i didn't like the idea of twilight but i thought i would read it and give it the benefit of the doubt. well i read it and i have to say i have an even worse opinion on the book. The book was so stereotypical with stuff that can set it apart BUT the things that set apart make it worse such as, \\"twinkling\\" when did vampires ever twinkle what are they tinker bell now? or the whole \\"vampire bad boy falls for the average popular girl\\". Bella Swan is another vapid female, she has no passion in anything all she does is get herself into to trouble and fall into a dangerouse crowd and her so called \\"love\\" is just a intense lust for the handsome guy. The male lead Edward Cullens is the stereotypical bad boy but thats not the problem with him it is that he is CREAPY!!! he stalks her, he is abusive, all he wants is her blood and mistakes that as love. I do not recommend to anyone unless they want a good laugh and a waste of a day or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even one intelligent sentence!","review":"This \`'book'' is worst then any harlequin you could ever imagine! Only sentence like \\" my Angel, my Romeo. I jump from rocks only to hear your voice\\". It is just awful and ... mostly boring. . It's the most ridiculous book I ever read. Poor Shakespeare he must turn in his grave after comparing obsessive school girl like Bella and vampire- superman like Edgar with Romeo and Julia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS BOOK!","review":"This is the best book I have ever read! I read it about a year and two months ago! And in three days. It's not surprising for me to read a book so fast but I let my bff read it and she didn't think she was going to finish it. she read it and LOVED it. then we got two of our other friends to read and they also loved it! We all have I love Edward cullen nacklaces and are OBSESSED. I'm sure all of the Twilight fans are obsessive. Some people are concerned that it isn't appropriate. It is completely appropriate! I read this book when I was 11 and didn't think it was innapropriate at all. This book is really sweet and keeps you wanting more. The sequel is also VERY good. but . . . let's just say it's kinda . . . shocking. (^^,)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Ever Read","review":"I generally don't like to read, but I LOVED this book and this whole series!!! Stephanie Meyer has such a great imagination and I felt like I could relate in one way or another with every character. I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not the average vampire","review":"I really liked these books.I have always enjoyed sci-fi and fantasy fiction but it's hard to find ones that don't have twisted sex, gushing blood and lots of evil people. This is actually romantic. Edward had no control over what happened to him, but wants to control and over come the the the dark side of him. He truly wants to become a better and moral being, to not react with rage, hate, and vindictiveness. The two main characters actually wait to be married before sex because it is more about real love than physical urges. Abstinence and self control, still a good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thriller Reader Tries Romance","review":"I've never read \\"romance\\" before (I know, I know, what kind of female am I?) so reading TWILIGHT was an education for me. I love a good star-crossed lovers plot (like Jaime and Yani in a thriller such asChasing Eden), and I did enjoy the whole vampire/human conundrum, but I have to admit it pretty much felt to me like a cool thriller without the plot. Instead of the protagonist and the dangerous love interest racing to do something, they get looooong periods of time to just sit around staring at how beautiful the other one is. Interesting.Enjoyed TWILIGHT very much, will probably read on. But have to admit I like my star-crossed lovers BUSY, as in the aforementioned Eden Thrillers. Well, best wishes to the TWILIGHTers, and try out a good thriller when you get the chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the hubbub, bub?","review":"I don't know what all the hubbub is about, really.The book took a neat idea that vampires are so beautiful they must shun the sun or be found out and then moved into a generic tale of romance that I never fully believed. I kept thinking that Bella got angry far too often over things that really would be mildly annoying.However, this is a YA novel, and I applaud the author for knowing her audience and writing with them in mind. This is every young girl's romance ideal: a strong man who finds a plain girl more beautiful and entrancing than anything he has seen. he's ready to die for her.How many romance readers are looking for exactly that kind of escape.It was a quick read despite it's breadth, which says a lot for the writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"YA romance with vampires...is anyone surprised?","review":"I'm well aware that I'm not the target audience for this book. But after repeated requests by friends to give it a shot, I acquiesced. I wish I could say this was something other than a YA romance novel with pretty vampires, but then I'd be lying to you. Filled with 100's of pages of teenage angst, (The back and forth between Edward and Bella in a scene that takes place in a diner is particularly insipid. He's how old?) Occasionally interspersed with Meyer's own peculiar additions to vampire mythology, (They sparkle in sunlight, they like baseball?) this novel safely defangs one of horrors truly evil creatures and transforms them into superheroes with \\"life\\" issues. Yes, there are bad vampires too, but I'm sure they'll be vanquished at some point as this book has as much tension as overcooked pasta. I am assured that the next two books improve the series significantly, but to be honest I'll never find out as getting through this one was painful enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy...","review":"(written by my daughter)If you found out that a glittery guy broke into your house and was watching you sleep, what would you say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight","review":"A whiny little girl falls in love with someone who sparkles and is tortured by his \\"vampire\\" existence.

If I finished it I would have lost too much. I would have ended up loving a vampire and looking at him in a strange way. Nah, couldn't do it. However, this author is nothing compared to J.K. Rowling. Stephanie doesn't have the element of surprise and sense that J.K. Rowling have in her books. Meyer only knows about disturbing irrational love. I know twilight fans will hate me after this, but I really don't care. I got Harry Potter fans having my back. And they are a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"This is a sad attempt at literature and basically nothing more then lame Young Adult abstinence porn. I have read Harlequin romance novels with better character development, plot, and overall writing style. Bella MarySue! is boring, does not develop as a character, and whines constantly throughout the entire series. She relies on men to save her and defines herself based on the value that CreepyStalker! Edward places on her.Oh, and girls, as a side note...any man that sneaks into your house to watch you sleep is not a romantic guy. Just imagine waking up to see a set of strange eyes grazing over your body. Yikes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight AUDIO CD","review":"This is regarding the Audio CDs, NOT THE TEXT. The narrator is so annoying and grating I literally couldn't listen past the first chapter. Complete waste of money. The way she reads the text makes it sound geared for an 11 year-old, or even younger. It makes you feel like you are listening in on a superficial little girl's diary. It is obvious they recorded it before Twilight became such a big hit, or they would have put more thought and value into the CDs. Such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"I'm not kidding. I've never considered returning a book I've read before, but I'm considering it. This was the worst book I've ever read and I can't believe 1.someone published it 2.people like it and 3.that I paid money and wasted a few hours of my life reading it. Seriously, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: waste of time and money","review":"I bought this book because I heard many great things about it, but when I read it I was disappointed. This book does NOT have a plot, the characters are superficial, and there are grammar mistakes. It is long and nothing interesting happens in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like, snore.....","review":"What a snoozer!! The characters in this book were truly bland and insipid. The story had plenty of holes in it, and while I do understand this book is a \\"romantic fantasy\\" it is so painfully immature. There was nothing unique or special about Bella (unless you find being a putz charming) in neither her looks nor her thoughts (Oh, she didn't WANT to go to prom, what an outsider! Whatever.) I can't believe in 90 years the guy couldn't find anyone better than that to be in love with. So stupid. This book was just hard to endure. Bad writing (grammar, holes), bad story ( the \\"bad guy\\" gives away his motives before he makes his move, always a bad mistake), bad characters (boring), but not necessarily a bad concept. All in all, awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really love the characters","review":"I may be in my mid 20's, but Twilight has become one of my new favorite books. To date, I have read it 3 times and it's only been 5 months since I got it.I don't want to spoil the story, so I'll just say what makes it so fabbity fab in my opinion: The author was able to make characters and situations that are supernatural (vampires) as well as a bit contrived (Bella's maturity) yet I was still able to suspend disbelief. I never once said to myself that the events of the story couldn't take place in any reality...even the author's.I am not much for romance in books as it tends to make me uncomfortable with it's insincerity but I found myself giggling with delight and had stars in my eyes after finishing Twilight.Oh...even my husband liked it and he doesn't like anything but the Dune books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR SERVICE","review":"THIS BOOK HAS BEEN OUT ON SHELFS FOR SALE FOR ALMOST 5 WEEKS NOW, BUT DO I HAVE MY COPY YET?

I like having a rough and tumble copy of a book I can't put down, and one to put with my other priceless volumes. This story belongs along side the great classics for it's ability to draw you in, make you feel connected to the characters, long for an outcome, and be dizzy with passion and intensity in the process. A definate read for all! Stephenies Meyers opening novel for the series paints a vivid picture of small town life where nothing is as normal as it seems. The utter obliviousness of some characters to the amazingly obvious deviations of others make it even better. The trials and tribulations of being 'the new kid' confound this dilema and then true love found makes it painful, and amazing at the same time for everyone.

For all others, avoid like the plague. Unfortunately, the author is a poor writer and although her ideas for a vampire story are fine, it is delivered in a very drawn out and overly angst-ridden way.The new movie very well mirrors the book. So much so, there is no need to read the book if you watch the film-you'll certainly be able to avoid the atrocious sentence structure and lack of editing (the two primary reasons why this isn't a 4 star book) and get the same take on Meyer's view of love and vampires."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like I have been drained of my blood, and my ten bucks.","review":"I felt I should read this because I will soon be a high school English teacher. I expected a decent piece of literature because it has become so popular.

Yes, Bella and Edward are not even saving themselves for vampire marriage. Edward will never ever be able to \\"do that\\" with Bella. So sad. I would think more about the messages it is sending to young girls. The \\"beautiful boy always saving poor Bella\\" is about as sickening as it gets. It is really disgusting how he carries her around, poor helpless, stupid little thing.Stephanie Meyers, your no J.K. Rowling.

But then I checked out the Amazon reviews, and they did make a few good points I'd sort-of noticed:For instance, yeah, Bella doesn't talk or really act like a teenager. There's a difference between sounding mature and sounding forty.Also, there was a little too much purple prose. As an avid reader of fancition, I immediately noticed the constant descriptions of eyes. Ocher, liquid topaz eyes? Porcelain, marble skin? Yeah. It was a bit redundant.Finally, some of the themes of the book were somewhat trite.Still, I fell in love with it--so points to the author for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got stalker?","review":"I know people are going to show up at my house with pitch forks, but I really wasn't into this book.

I kept reading it, waiting for it to get better. Waiting for the googly-eyed teenagers to come back to the real world and for the story to start. Unfortunately, it doesn't happen until the very last few chapters. And even then, it's just not that good. Even the romance had no real chemistry. This book was recommended to be by one of my favorite Youtubers, but I have to disagree. I don't see how any independent, intelligent female could possibly like Bella Swan. I kept waiting for her to grow a spine and wake up. I really wanted to slap her! if this is the kind of book that modern teenagers are dying to read, I really fear for the future of this country.

Belle is so pathetic and weak. The first 8 chapters (300+ pages) are so incredibly boring and they all revolve around Belle being enamored by Edward (in which he hardly makes any appearances). Not only do these events occur, but it gets old reading about Belle talking about the stupid rain CONSTANTLY. The rest of the book involves Belle being rescued over and over again. The characters in this novel lack so much character.Just the idea of a vampire in high school makes me want to laugh up my insides. THIS IS NOT A BOOK FOR VAMPIRE LOVERS!!!!

Oooh, look how romantic it is to be completely helpless with zero self esteem, and to fall inexplicably and instantaneously in love with a possessive, dangerous, tempermental MAN, not a teenage boy, but a man WHO WATCHES YOU SLEEP.

I am glad I did not notice that when I bought it. I am 41 and I might not have purchased it. I am so glad I did. I have not had a book pull me in like this one did in a very long time. I became completely immersed in the characters and read all three books in a week. I will definitely be reading them again. The last time I remember becomming so enthralled with characters from a book was Anne Rice years and years ago. I would anxiously await the next book in the series and then devour it when I finally got it...reading all through the night unable to put it down. The Twilight series is like that. I could not put it down. It is one of those stories where you become so immersed in the book that you forget what is going on around you. I hope this series keeps going and I cant read to read more by this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my gosh, I love this book!!!","review":"I just finished Twilight by Stephenie Meyer's. Like many of the other reviewers I have never read a vampire story. It is a story that will appeal to both vampire and non-vampire fans alike. This book, in my opinion, could be read by a mature junior high student up to adult. Bella and Edward are very passionate, but the book is clean, and therefore suitable for younger teens. I can't wait to read New Moon and am very excited to hear that there will be a third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"It's always been hard for me to answer when I get asked the question \\"What's your favorite book?\\" Well at least it was hard for me until I read this. Now I always automatically answer \\"Twilight\\".I'm big on romance, vampire fiction, and thrills- and this book has it all. I related to the characters and felt like Bella myself- just without an Edward.After telling everyone about it; my mom, my friends, and my friend's moms all wanted to read it and enjoyed it just as well.I compare almost every book I've read after reading this, and absolutely NONE of them can compare with this book's brilliancy.New Moon was just as good, and I can't wait for Eclipse to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID and BORING","review":"Kinda trashy. There are things left to be desired.I gave up 1/3 in. That's how bad it was. If I heard her talk about his face like an angel or smell I would gag"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Judge The Books By The Movies","review":"5 stars in 2011: The books are realy good!!!! the movies give them a bad name the story makes you want to keep reading and reading. Its an Awsome story !!!****UPDATE**** 1 star in 2013:I forgot I even wrote this review, I read Twilight when I was first starting to get into reading. After I've now read so many other books, I take back what I said. I think that the story could have been really good if it was more well written. I still think the movies are trash, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Despite the Vampire-ness","review":"I'll admit it-- I am NOT a fan of vampires, so when my sister recommended this book to me, it's safe to say I had more than a few doubts. However, the POV of Bella, as well as the intense character development of the two star-crossed lovers, captured my attention. I read all 500 pages in one sitting-- it was AMAZING!All this to say, even if you have doubts about books with vampires in them, this one is fantastic, and doesn't resort to the usual cliches generally overused in most vampire stories. 5 out of 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"I read this book, and it was truely amazing. I've already read it two times, and i'm reading the sequel to it for the second time also. It is so amazing, I can't even put it into words. The sequel, New Moon, is excellent. Not quite as good as Twilight, but still a-ma-zing.I didn't even think it was possible for there to be a book as good as this.The emotions draw you in, and you fall in love with the characters instantly (Especially Edward and Alice.)All I can say is, you MUST read it. If you don't, you don't know what a good book is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I like a good Vampire romance. They are light and good way to wind down before bed. I don't even mind decent fiction for young adults as there are good stories to be had; so I bought this book because of the reviews. Well, it's awful. Is this really what our teen aged girls are like? I wasn't and my daughter wasn't. This is just plain pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"First of a great series","review":"You'll be hooked. This is the first book of a great series. Interesting main characters and deep plot line. Won't disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had so many friends that raved about this book, that I finally read it myself. I was greatly disappointed. I thought the writing was very juvenile and the characters were very shallow. I don't like weak feminine roles, which the main character, Bella, is. She is pretty, but doesn't know it- please! How stupid is that? She faints/trips/injures herself all the time. She falls for Edward based purely on his looks. They soon develop a very dependent relationship- their relationship is not based on common interests or values. They just instantly fall in love and cannot be separated. I do not want my daughters to read this and think that true love means to be infatuated with someone and that they should hold our for the \\"perfect\\" person. I just thought the book was very childish and lacked depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Dreck","review":"This book is an insult to the intelligence of any reader that is not completely stupid. I cannot believe the success of a book that nothing really happens in. A Mormon Vampire. Not interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm in love!","review":"After reading this story, you will never look at your own love life the same ever again. Every woman needs an Edward!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier","review":"I love reading and I especially love reading about vampires. Though I enjoy many books, I have never quite gotten into them as I had gotten into Twilight! I was hooked since the cafeteria scene where the Cullens and the Hales were introduced and couldn't put the book down until I was finished. Its a great read. Hands down this goes on top of my favorite books list. Its more romance than vampire or anything else. Typical love impossible story. Girl sees boy. Boy sees girl. Add vamp to the equation and you get Twilight. Who wouldn't want to be in Bella's place? I definitely suggest reading this book for an amazing experience. I'm sure you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight = Awesome","review":"I origanlly heard about this series through the internet but when I heard what it was about I was put off it (vampires - not something that would normally catch my attention). I finally caved after watching the trailer for the film adaption.. best decision ever! Twilight is now one of my all time favourite series and I recommend it to everyone. I haven't come across anyone who doesn't love it; it's a book with awesome, loveable characters and and a great plot - a read in one sitting then re read (and re read and re read) type of book. Go buy it already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"i thought this book was amazing i couldnt stop reading it this book only took me 2 dayz to read so i cant wait until i read the next one i think anybody whos anybody would love this book cuz i loved it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad writing","review":"I should have expected to be disappointed by this...But, after being told how much I would like the Harry Potter books, and being too stubborn to read them until after the biggest craze had past, and then liking them....I thought maybe there waould be something to this series as well..Well, in my opinion there isnt. I wont go into long rants about it. I will just say if you arent a 12 year old girl, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is horrible.","review":"I cannot believe the hype that surrounds these books or the associated franchise. These novels are written at a [...] reading level - the vocabulary is poor, the sentence structure is completely dull and monotonous, and there is no literary flourish.While Edward does the occasional chivalrous, heroic act, his behavior seems overall overprotective, condescending, and stalker-ish. Ask yourself this: would you think it romantic if after your next first date you found the guy hiding in your bedroom to watch you sleep? Or would you call the police...? I certainly hope my future daughter/son does not think Edward's behavior is endearing or acceptable.That being said, Twilight is a very quick read and the story itself is somewhat creative. One-third through I completely altered my expectations which then made its inanity rather amusing. Read with a grain, or shaker, of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I guess you have to like romance, vampire themes, and extremely poor writing to like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not literature","review":"This book, and the entire series for that matter, is a pathetic excuse for literature. It is poorly written and lacks any special qualities. This book and the series are among the other books of today that sell extremely well for no reason except that the book itself is formulated for nothing else but that."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this book","review":"wow this book is great if you love romance and vampires wow ypu will live this book you won't be able to put it down trust me i had to read it really"},{"rating":"2","title":"must read","review":"I can't get enough of Meyer's book I have read it at least three time all the way through and read countless times my favorite chapters (13&14). Counting down the days for the third book. If you like vampire books and love stories with-out the porn (cough-cough-anne-rice-cough-cough) this is the series for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"I think it took me eight hours to finish this book.

I was even dreaming about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome book","review":"This book is awsome. the auther makes you feel like you are bella. the way she descibes edward is remarkable, you pictuer him your head. You never want to put the book down and when you're finally done you want to race to the next book. I highly recamend this book to anyone that likes vampires and love stories. you will really fall in live with book and it's characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have to force myself to stop reading it","review":"I read books everyday before I go to bed. when I was reading this book, I have to force myself to stop reading it, save for tomorrow so that I won't wake up late for work tomorrow.I really love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I found Twilight and the subsequent books a wonderful read. It had romance, drama, and action. Who cares if it wasn't based in reality. IT IS A NOVEL. THAT IS WHY IT IS CALLED FICTION. What a wonderful way to relax, get away from the real world for a little while, and live in a fantasy where a very human girl, and a strong, protective vampire fall in love and take care of one another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised","review":"A friend of mine who usally enjoys reading the same books as I do, suggested I read this book. I knew her book suggestions were always good...but, a book about vampires did not even interest me. WHile sitting at a friend's house I noticed the book and read the first 10 pages and I was hooked. I downloaded the book on my Kindle as soon as I got home. I enjoyed reading the book. I actually had a very difficult time putting thr book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"PG but still worth reading.","review":"OK SPOILER! For all of you out there who either haven't seen the movie, read the book or seen anything on TV about Twilight, or spoken to anyone that has read it.I couldn't put it down but was a little disappointed that it was so PG! I hurried to read book 2 and was annoyed that Bella still doesn't get to be a vampire! Maybe finally in book 4. Who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight - AWESOME","review":"All three books in the series are just as great as the other. Cannot wait until the 4th book comes out in August!! This is a recommended read for anyone, young or old. Once you get past the first few pages, you are hooked and cannot wait for more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"Everyone kept telling me to buy the book it was better than the movie. I strongly disagree the movie is so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.K. Rowling could of made it a masterpiece","review":"Twilight had a great idea of a story line. Stephanie Meyer is not ment to write books for anyone over the age of 13. Now if Twilight was written by someone with more talent such as J. K. Rowling I think it could have been an amazing book. I'll admit once I started reading I had to finish all of the books! Then again it's not like it took long considering there was no creativity in the writing or any challenge what so ever. I agree with Stephen King that she is nothing compared to J.K. Rowling who would have come up with something better then vampires who \\"sparkle\\"...seriously? SPARKLE? ummm no vampires are not ment to sparkle...Overall if you want an easy read that doesnt take more then 5 hours and make yourself feel like a bubbly 13 year old girl for reading it go ahead. You'll be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, Blah, Snore, etc.","review":"I know a lot of the reviews her have focused on the plot (or lack there of) and poor character development of this book, so I'd like to focus on the writing style. I'll also make it quick. This book is simply (dare I say poorly) written. It uses way too many cliches, is boring, and repetitive. It's probably good enough for its target audience - young teenage girls. It reminds me of the original V.C. Andrews books (Flowers in the Attic). Blah and bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big five stars","review":"I have to say, I really liked Bella's character. I know some people blame her for being too head over heels in love with Edward and being shallow for focusing so much on his looks. Still, I think she was an interesting character, and I found her very brave and self-sacrificing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Great book, awesome story. It is an easy read and very intense. Great for all ages. Great gift for teen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight book 1","review":"Love every minute of the book. Looking forward to the other books too. Excellent read. enjoyed the story very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst thing I've ever read","review":"I am 22 and I have heard many great things about this book so I decided to read it myself. After finishing the first I have concluded that you either have to be a) in your early teens or b) an adult who is not well read to enjoy these books. I have been reading since I was a small child and I felt like I was far too grown up for this. So if you are between the ages of 12 and 15 read it and love it, but if you are older than 15 pick up a Jane Austen or a Bronte and start reading, it is about time you read something intelligent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Great read. Better than the movie for sure. Can't wait to start the next one. Kinda glad I didn't read the book before the movie. I would've walked out of the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my valuable time!","review":"I truly only suffered through the reading of this book because I paid for it. I wouldn't say it was the WORST read of my life but it is pretty darn close. The character development is weak and the theme lacking and repetitive to a nauseating degree. I'd suggest waiting for it to come out in its movie form (yes, I've heard they are making a movie of this book) and THEN wait for it to come out as a rental - or even better - free on HBO, Showtime, Starz - or whatever other premium channel you have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise but too melodramatic and not a healthy love relationship","review":"You know, I really wanted to like this book. I work at a high school and noticed lots of girls reading it so I borrowed a copy and settled down, hoping to discover an author that I could be excited about. It started, I thought, rather slowly, and while I admit it held my attention enough to keep me reading (I have no problem putting a book down that doesn't hold my attention) I never felt a real desire to stop doing things and read it. And the love story is so immature and juvenile! Of course I realize that might be the intent of the author and that might be why it appeals especially to young girls but after a while I found it to be one dimensional and just not interesting.So this reader will not be following the corny and melodromatic saga of Bella Swan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This over-rated and over-hyped book lacks depth and substance. Despite my intentions of wanting to like it, it's quite boring filled with cheesy and corny dialogues. My advice for everyone is to avoid as well as the rest of the series and find something else worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Live Up To The Hype","review":"I simply could not get through this book. Bella's mindless adoration of Edward is a complete turn-off. Is physical attractiveness so supremely important? Characters lack depth. Waiting for the plot to develop is like watching paint dry. I've encountered better writing and characterizations in the much-maligned romance genre than in this book. Unlike J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, which I feel truly appeal to kids, teens, adults alike, \\"Twilight\\" ought to come with a warning to adults to not waste their time ... and a warning to parents that it teaches entirely wrong values to impressionable young teenage girls. I am truly amazed by the immense popularity of this series, given the superficiality of the main characters and the insipid dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied.","review":"I was rather disappointed in this book. I didn't find Bella (the lead) engaging and wasn't convincing as a teen. Edward, on the other hand, was the very definition a masculinity, but he too, was rather shallow. I'm not sure why this series is so raved but it left me with an empty, unsatisfied feeling...and that is too bad, since this book had huge potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"best mythical saga I've read","review":"The author of this book does an amazing job portraying a real life very believable story about mythical \\"monsters\\" By the time I finished just the first book of this saga, I was so entrigued. I think it is meant for young/teenage girl readers, but I am 23 and found it to be one of the most captivating stories I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing First Novel!!!!!","review":"Twilight follows seventeen year old Bella who moves from Phoenix to Forks Oregon. Her father lives in Forks, while her mother lives in Phoenix. While there Bella had a hard time fitting into crowds, though most accepted her right away. Her first day at school in her biology class the man sitting next to her acted very strangely, his name was Edward. Bella couldn't figure out why he acted so weird towards her, they talked, and then they didn't for many months. Until Bella starts questioning who or in better words, what, Edward and his family really are.I truly enjoyed Meyer's work. Even though it is her first book she has extraordinary talent. Each character is unique and their actions and emotions are in tune with one another. She combined a great love story, with the action of the supernatural, that most writers have a hard time doing. This book was wonderful and I personally cannot wait for the sequel to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight is AWESOME!!","review":"This is the best book I've EVER read! I recommend this book to people who LOVE vampires and have seen the movie. This book is AWESOME!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great great great!!!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed all four books. Stephanie Meyer is a great writer. YOu don't need the steamy hot love scenes to make these books. There is a lot left to the imagination and that is wonderful. Even the way the series ends is fantastic!!! Great Great Series!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it seemed to be","review":"I did not date in high school, so this book was extremely difficult to relate to. In fact, I didn't get a good handle on Bella at all. She was such a whiner. The vampires were cool, as were the werewolves, but after I finished this book, I have not continued with the other three. No need to. Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter are fine for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern day Romeo & Juliet","review":"With Twilight, you either love it or hate it. Sort of like Lada Gaga. I happened to love it. Did I love it for it's brilliant writing? No. It's not going to win any literary awards. However, what Stephanie Meyers DOES do is tell a great story that constantly leaves you hanging. She knows how to hook you. And sometimes that's all we need. That little reason to escape from doldrums of the day to day. In the end, Twilight isn't about Vampires and Werewolves. It's about a tale as old as time: forbidden love. And for those romance addicts, these books are a welcome addition to our libraries.Danielle Bannister, Author ofPulled"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh yes!","review":"Twilight is a wonderful book, I wasn't into reading about Vampires until I read this after it first came out then bought the 2nd book then the 3rd then the 4th now all I read is Vampire books. The movie did not bring the book to justice I thought but they are getting better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Number 1","review":"How can I rate this book??? Wonderful! The main character was put into different situations and came out on top. There is the normal drama of a typical teenager's life and then added drama of being in a world were fanatical monsters are real. The action and love story in this series is not a typical story but a tale all it's own! It is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosie the Riveter would be ashamed","review":"Women all over the world should be ashamed of the way we are depicted as silly, love-struck, unthinking beings who would sacrifice ourselves, our integrity, our honor for just an iota of a boy's attention. Such drivel only regresses young, impressionable women to shallower depths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Must Have","review":"For a true hardcore fan of the Twilight books. Beautifully put together, lovely little extras with the rough cut pages, ribbon and artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what the hype is about","review":"I am a young adult lit fan as well as vampire storylines...but I quit reading this book less than half way through, and I almost never quit a book, even if I'm not thrilled with it. I kept waiting for it to go somewhere, but it never did. I slowly realized this was a kid's book and wouldn't have the vivid storylines I was used to. Then, I started thinking about the fact that Harry Potter, technically YA lit, was full of plot.I'm not exactly sure what the hype is all about with this series, but the freshman effort left me cold and I'm not willing to give the other books my time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting","review":"This book makes you want to read the next book, and the next, and the next, and the next! Then you scream for her to make the 5th."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparkly vampires..Made of diamond?","review":"Well,this is a romance fantasy series based upon vampires.Sparkly vampires with diamond skin..Bella is a self insert of the author. She is also a typical, every day, \\"Mary Sue\\". Edward is her stalker, obsessive, somewhat manipulative boyfriend.This book has necrophilia, pedophilia, sexism, bad writing, among other issues..However, this book is a poorly written fantasy, literally. The author had a dream, or so she says, and she took one scene and made it into a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read!!","review":"From the moment I started reading the first book to the last page of the fourth book, I could not put the books down.These books take you away to another place with people and vampires that seems real.The love story between Bella and Edward is beautiful.The books describes suspense, love and struggles between good and evil.A must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book - even for adults","review":"This was the first vampire book I had read. It was after the movie was playing and all the hype about it that I decided to order the book and see. I hadn't seen the movie yet and thought, if the movie is getting this much attention the book must be great. So, I ordered the first two and absolutely was hooked. This is a very good read for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, easy read","review":"This is a great story for young adults.

If you like love stories, then you have to read Twilight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"This book is a very good romantic story about a girl who falls in love with a vampire. Once you start reading it, you can;t put it down. But, the guys might think that this is more of a girl boook because it is very romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twilight","review":"This must be by far the worst book I ever laid hands on! I took so much effort to finish this book, when I just wanted to toss it in the fire. The characters are absolutely depthless, and the relationship between Edward and Bella is appalling. I do not know why Stephanie Meyer, being a woman would create such a weak, whiny, insecure and utterly dependent lead female character. And on top of that she created a psychotic/stalker boyfriend for Bella. I do not know about you, but this doesn't look like the healthiest of relationships to me. The dialogue of this book makes me want to shoot someone. If all the \\"I love you/I cannot live without you\\" nonsense was taken off, I bet there wouldn't be a book. Anyway, do not waste your money on this ghastly piece of literature (What has happened to literature nowadays??)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Stephen King Had To Say","review":"I flipped through a few pages in a store and saw what Stephen King said in a recent interview when he said Meyer was the WORST WRITER he had ever read. Ouch!After reading reviews I'm going to buy a (used) copy (Meyer's making $ hand over fist) and study how NOT to write.I found the one-star reviews to be so hilarious most of you ought to be comedy writers! You all exhibit more talent than Meyer. Life just ain't fair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder what all of the hype is about?","review":"After all of the hype surrounding this book I must say that I expected more. This book was so bad that I couldn't even finish it, and I've read probably every vamprie book out there, good or bad. It's rare that something is so bad that I don't finish it, so that says something about this book. It was unoriginal, the main character was little more than a Mary Sue, and the writing was amateurish at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining...","review":"I have enjoyed reading the Twilight series. It is definitely written for teenage girls, which makes sections of the book difficult to read. As a whole, however, it is an entertaining story. The book is written in a way that makes it very easy to read. I managed to finish the series in just over two weeks. If you enjoy the first book, be sure to push through the second. It is kind of boring for an adult male, but the thrid and fourth books are entertaining as well, making it worthwhile to read book two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book, gripping series.","review":"I just finished Breaking Dawn---the last book in the series---and I must say that each book truly built upon the one before.In Twilight---the first book in the series---all the main characters are introduced: the Cullen family, Jacob, and Bella. The book is written from the perspective of the heroine, Bella Swan. Though Bella is a teenager in high school, I never felt like I was reading a book for children. This book had the breadth, depth, and imagination to keep me---a married 35 year-old woman---enthralled. I don't normally purchase books about vampires and such, but because there are so many other facets to this book---love, good vs. evil, desire, action, and adventure---I never felt like this book was solely a vampire book.I highly recommend this book, and the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST STORY I'VE EVER READ","review":"I initially saw the trailer to the movie and heard it was based off of a novel. As I did with other movies, I bought the book so I can read it before the movie is released. I bought the book in Sept and didn't start reading until November. Once I started the story, I couldn't stop. I read one after the other non-stop. I even sped off the the store twice to pick up the next story/book in the saga. I ended up reading all four books in the Twilight Saga within a week. Once I finished them, I was still left wanting more of the story. It was a story I didn't want to end. I do hope that the author will decide to pick up where she left off and continue the story in some way. I recommend this book as well as the complete series to everyone of all ages. THANK YOU STEPHENIE MEYER FOR THE BEST STORY I'VE EVER READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden Love Story","review":"Excellent start to the series! I'm glad I am going back and reading the books AFTER seeing the movie. SO many more details in the book AND explanations for things I was curious about in the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This is the most ridiculous series I've ever read. The characters are unrealistic and hopelessly annoying. The plot holes are huge enough to encompass the entire universe, and the little plot there is drags.The main character, Bella, is a whiny, selfish girl with no personality and a stalker boyfriend, as well as someone who left 20 people to die just so she could stare at said boyfriend's face. The other characters seem pretty much the same, making the series almost impossible to get through - you just want to scream at the characters and maybe give them a little bit of sense.If you want to know the plot of this series, read all of the blogs from this link: [...]. It is absolutely hilarious, while it gives you a great picture of how purely inane this series is. These blogs are a far better use of your time than RIDICULOUS book/series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooo Sooooo Overrated and Sooooo Soooo Disappointing","review":"I don't get it either. Seriously?

It's nauseating. I'm only a few chapters in but it's just endless description of boring things. The writing actually reminds me of some of my teenage diaries (full of angst, metaphor and not particularly interesting to anyone but me). I've heard that there is some kind of conflict later in the book that at least moves the plot along but I'm about 200 pages in and I'm suffering. The writing is terrible, not much plot, not much reason to really care about any of the characters. Ugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"I understand how this is popular amongst young teens but the fact that it was voted best book of the year/decade as claimed on the back cover is completely beyond me. The story is semi interesting but the characters are incredibly dull, the dialogue is repetitive and cheesy and the protagonist REALLY annoying.Also the most exciting climactic action occurs off page, what a cop out!! I love vampire stories but this was incredibly disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"its just hype ...no good","review":"The story is unoriginal and predictable. The story line was much like that teenage drama show \\"Rosewell\\" except she replaced the aliens with vampires. The novel focuses on the romantic connection between her narrator, bella, and her vampire boyfriend Edward. which is a pity because she had an array of characters that would of potentially be very interesting but instead she wrote mainly about Bella and Edward which is ok, except there wasn't much to say. She basically kept repeating the same conversation over and over again. \\"I'm dangerous, I might Kill you\\" \\"I don't really care. I love you\\" talking about repetition she couldn't stop talking how good looking Edward was. She didn't really give a good description but liked to say through out a book that was was \\"an Adonis\\" or \\"a male model\\" I got so sick of reading it I wished he was ugly so she would need to make more effort in writing. Lame book waste of trees."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAG GAG GAG!","review":"This is possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I read it because my daughters have read the books. Neither of my daughters love these books, but they both have read the complete series and laugh about the books often. I like to keep current with what they are reading, listening to and viewing so I thought I would check this out. They are right to laugh, this book is terrible! Poorly written (I'm actually being kind here) This story is a bout a controlling, manipulative manic depressive \\"hero\\" and a self obessesed, selfish \\"heroine\\" The story is supposedly about love, but it gives young girls the wrong idea about love- I'm glad I read it so that I could discuss this with my girls and help them see how ridiculous the \\"plot\\" is and we could discuss what love really is. The book ends with what could easliy be the most moronic \\"climax\\" ever set to papaer. Save your money- more important SAVE YOUR TIME!!! DO NOT READ THIS GARBAGE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overall read!","review":"Not as much action as in the movie and I'm sort of an action buff! Lol but I love how Bella was so much more likeable than she was in the movie I found myself laughing at her crazy independence and quirky attitude, like I said, great overall book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight--book 1","review":"A must read!!! My daughter and I fell in love with Edward from the first pages! This was the first book in the Saga purchased as a \\"trial\\" you know..you never know if you'll like a book?....we now have the entire collection!! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Reading","review":"Very light reading and a wonderful love story. The book will keep your interest and has many fun characters. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I really enjoyed reading Twilight and went to see the movie not too long ago. I can't wait to read the rest of the saga. The book kept me interested and was an awesome page turner. I couldn't put it down. It's one of the first books that I really got into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book. Couldn't even finish it","review":"I saw this movie for a dollar a while back in Birmingham. It was so bad that I left the theater early. Twilight hatred became a big hobby of mine, but some fans got mad at me and said I couldn't say anything against the series unless I read the book. So I decided to try to read this book. And beyond my wildest nightmares, it was WORSE than the movie. At least the movie ends after 2 hours. This book is so poorly written, with uninteresting characters and a sluggish pace to it all. At page 195 with the 3 things Bella was most certain of, I gave up. Save your money and check this out of the library if you must read it, but I'd suggest just ignoring this, maybe get The Host, I haven't gotten into that book yet, but I've read a little bit and it has interesting characters and looks really good and probably proves that Meyer is a good writer, this dribble is just not worth the time it takes to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for young adult readers!","review":"This book was selected by one of our book club members as our selection for October. We will discuss it on Halloween. Overall, I am hearing from all the members as to how much they enjoyed the book and how they plan on reading the others in the series. The book is a easy, quick read (even with 500 some pages). I would highly recommend this book to anyone for a quick escape from the world for a weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"Didn't think I would enjoy a book written about teenagers and vampires but I enjoyed the first book so much I purchased all four and was sad when I came to the end. She is a writer that uses words to bring you into the story and make you feel as if you were there on the sidelines checking it out as it happended. I recommend all four books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight by Stephanie Meyer","review":"Excellant saga..If she would only write more in addition to the current four. I would buy and read them all. Thank you for having them stocked and ready to mail."},{"rating":"1","title":"stimulated my gag reflex","review":"I was told this would be a good \\"mental break\\" for me. Instead, I found myself criticizing everything from Edward's ridiculous perfection to Bella's constant whining. Where is the story? Why did it take 400 pages to describe Edward's beauty, and his angst-ridden relationship with Bella? Did Meyer ever study a plot line in highschool literature class? And I can't seem to find any depth in these characters, either. They just exist, matter of factly, like Meyer doesn't even care that we don't know them. These are HER imaginary friends, and I have to say I agree with her that I can't see why anyone other than her likes this story.All in all I found the love story in Twilight to be so ridiculous that I could hardly enjoy it. A story has to be somewhat grounded in reality to be good, and this just... wasn't. I actually found it rather insulting as a woman to have been expected to swoon over this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Steel meets Harry Potter","review":"I am a person who has been missing Harry Potter deeply... and Twilight is the first book that made we want to read non-stop since! I read all 4 books in no time at all - and am rather sad that it I didn't drag it out a little longer - but once I started I could not put them down! With the main focus of the book being a love story - I would compare it to Daniel Steel meets Harry Potter. These books became my obsession and opened a up a whole new realm of books that I never thought I would be interested in - the supernatural. I WANT MORE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"Good book to read, well-paced. Only complaint is that the love parts kinda get overly sappy/corny but other than that, you should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucked","review":"A complete and total waste of time. A complete distruction of all good things about vapires, books, ect. I died a litle inside when I read this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping story","review":"This first book was wonderful I could not put it down in fact I finished all three of the Twilight Series in a week! The story that comes to life with Bella and Edward is gripping and amazing. One thing I wished is there was a bit more on the prom it jumped from one scene to the next. Despite that I would recommend this series to everyone and I cannot waite until the 4th book comes out \\"Breaking Dawn\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written","review":"I got this book thinking it was going to be one of those short in between fill-your-time kind of books. I was definitely wrong. This book was so good, I couldn't put it down. I finished it in a day and couldn't wait to read the next one. If you enjoy romance with a little bit of fantasy at the same time, this book is for you. Stephenie Meyer has a way of keeping her readers captivated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"I felt so silly when I bought this book. Then I couldn't put it down. I've read all three so far at lease 4 times in the past few months, and I love them.Just great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first book...","review":"...however I can really only say that for the first book of the series. When I read Twilight I was very excited to read the rest of the series. Let's just say Stephenie Meyer should have spent more time writing the way she did for Twilight (especially on New Moon and Breaking Dawn) and less time thinking about how to make her characters incredibly whiny and not at all enjoyable to read (Bella in New Moon and Edward/Jacob in Breaking Dawn).Twilight however was irresistible. I finished this book in about 5 hours one night, and I skipped dinner to do so. I just couldn't put it down! I think every girl wants to find a love like what Bella and Edward have, which is probably why so many young teenage girls like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe if I was 12","review":"Hearing all the hype, I was hoping for another series like Harry Potter. I was immensely disappointed. The writing doesn't compare. This book does not seem to be for all age groups nor does it cross the male/female gender gap. If you are a pre-teen girl its for you- but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addison's Review","review":"Twilight is a good novel if you enjoy a highschool romance which is twisted only by the sci-fi fantasy of the 'mysterious' vampire world. It, over all, is a simple read, though Stephenie Meyer has created a nice story line. Since this series has come out, I have seen far more teenagers around my age reading, which is pleasant to see.However, if you are looking for a challenge, oir characters with realistic depth and personality, this is not what you are looking for. Twilight is very simple to read and comprehend, and Meyer's characters all are described in a lovely fashion, Bella being an honours student who falls inlove with Edward cullen and his secret vampire life, but she is not consistant in some features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen King was right....","review":"Ms. Meyer can't write worth a darn...I suppose I can see the appeal to some teenage girls, but I wonder what any adult who is literate can get out of this book. A hot guy who doesn't want to have sex with you? I heard that was the appeal to some, who knows. I read this because a teen girl I mentor pushed the issue. I gave it the good old girl scout try, but I just couldn't get into it. It was drudgery. At this point I think people read it because it has just reached a \\"pop\\" phenomenon and people are curious to find out what the hype is all about. But dear heavens, Meyer is a lucky woman...this book would probably fail fiction writing 101. Sad, there are so many wonderful YA novels out there, and this is the one that becomes a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get what all the fuss is about","review":"After hearing so much hype and excitement about the twilight series I decided to give it a go. I tried to approach the book with an open mind and not bee too critical. However, no matter how much I tried I just couldn't get into it or enjoy it. If I could rate this book a zero I would.Firstly it is extremely badly written and I don't know how it was even published. It takes a long time for any real action to take place, especially given it's a book about vampires. Edward Cullen, who is supposed to be this great sex symbol is a very creepy, narcissistic stalker. He treats Bella as though she is a stupid girl and he's her father. I just don't see how this is meant to be a great romance.What bothers me most about this book is that so many young women are embracing the series. Bella is the worst role model a teenage girl could possibly have. If you want vampire action with real strong female characters watch Buffy instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight by Stephenie Meyers","review":"A heart soaring romantic novel. This story is the beginning of obsession for many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good love story - problematic vampire story","review":"In order to rate this book fairly, I will keep in mind that it was written for teens. From that perspective, it was a good love story riddled with the infectious but immature themes of unconsummated love and all-consuming passion that the young find so compelling. Of course, I would worry about any adult woman who would find this sort of love anything but creepy and suffocating.It would be nice if Meyer and other authors of vampire stories could agree upon some \\"rules\\" governing vampire behavior. These days, authors arbitrarily reinvent vampires to suit their own narcissistic story telling, causing these already mythical creatures to become simultaneously everything and nothing at all. Vampires need a clear identity for the legend to remain interesting. Let's decide on a definition for vampires and stick with it, shall we? It seems lazy to do otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, So-So writing","review":"Clearly people love this book. Overall, I thought that the story was good for the age group that it is written for, but I am glad that I didn't buy it (I'm in my 20s). The writing leaves ALOT to be desired.If you have a young adult in mind, read this book. Otherwise, the more mature reader would likely enjoy Jim Butcher, Charlaine Harris, or Tanya Huff more. I know that I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Teens","review":"I initially read this book to see what the hoopla was all about. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I believe that any woman could appreciate the story of a young girl (17) and her first love. Sure, our first loves were not vampires, but that doesn't make it any less nostalgic. Stephenie Meyer did a great job of writing this story in a way that grips you in and makes you truely feel for the characters. As I was reading, I could feel the inner torment Edward felt towards his relationship with Bella. I could understand why this was a such a difficult relationship for both of them, but why they couldn't fathom the idea of being apart. This is the first book of a remarkable series! Overall, I would tell you not to dwell on the fact that it is located in the Teen Fiction section. Pick it up and give it a try, you'll be pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book!!","review":"I heard about this book from a friend and wasn't sure I would like it because it is about vampires... however, I came on Amazon and saw that I could get a really cheap copy so I just ordered it and crossed my fingers. Well I LOVED this book so much! I finished it in about 1 1/2 days and read the rest of the series in a total of 20 days. I would definitely recommend this or any of the other books from the twilight series to everyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, Entertaining, and Fast Read.","review":"As many have said, this is not a horror story, it is a love story. However, the story reaches bridges the gap of young adult to mature audiences. I would feel comfortable reading this book to my 10 year old daughter. The 500+ pages go by extremely fast, and leave the reader wanting more. In fact I just finished book 4 which is 753pages in one day. The novels are gripping, dramatic and emotional. I highly recommend them to anyone ages 10-100 male or female and PLEASE don't be discouraged by the size of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the first book, forget the rest","review":"After all the hype, I was surprised to discover that Twilight was actually a pleasant read.The book is not without its problems - character development is somewhat weak, the writing is haphazard and often sloppy, and the climax of the book is ill-timed and somewhat unconvincing. I actually enjoyed the moive characterisation female protagonist, Bella, better than the book.But, overall, I nonetheless quite enjoyed Twilight's depiction of the angst and excitement of a first teenage romance.A word of warning, however - as the Twilight series continues, the writing degenerates. The characters become annoyingly one-dimensional and inconsistent, the writing becomes sloppier and the plot becomes simply ludicrous to the point that it becomes almost physically painful to read.Enjoy Twilight for what it is - a light-weight teen romance - but save yourself the agony of reading the following 3 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good love story, with a childs grammar","review":"The story of Twilight is a good one, it is a modern day comparison to \\"Romero and Juliet\\", but the author uses weak sentence structure and uses poor grammar. Among other authors, Meyer used a very poor choice in wording to the point that you wondered if an adult wrote the book. If Meyer used better grammar, the book would have felt more like an adult fiction versus a teen fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just OK","review":"After seeing all the hype for this I decided to check it out. The story was ok, nothing gripping about it. The first 2/3 of the book was mostly about the new gal in school and the kids that no one talks to because they are so mysterious. Towards the end it picked up a bit. I'm glad I read it but it is not one of my favorite reads. I can see young teenaged girls getting excited about this but that's about it. Much better vamp books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"30 Year Old Loved it....so much better than the movie","review":"I am so glad I read the book before seeing the movie. I loved loved the book. Couldn't put it down. Now the movie on the other hand...eh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I'm a Thirty-Something Who Loves Twilight","review":"Great characters. Great plot. Great writing. If you're an adult woman who has noticed the media circus, give in to your curiosity. You won't be disappointed. I'm currently on the 3rd book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY COOL!","review":"Plain and simple...I'm a writer, I loved it, and I will own the whole series. I'm also 40 years old and not ashamed to say I really like Edward Cullen along with the rest of his family, even Rosalie who can't stand Bella. There were a few things Stephanie did repeatedly that drove me nuts being I'm a writer myself, but otherwise she made a good story and changed my perception of vampires. Mind you...I still love BLADE and the whole concept to him ridding the world of \\"bad\\" vamps, but I really appreciate what Stephanie did with the Cullens and them being \\"vegetarians\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Teens!","review":"This book was assigned for our book club. I was skeptical about reading a teen's book about vampires. But, wow was I impressed. Stephenie Meyer does an incredible job making you believe in the unbelievable characters. This book spans the age groups and will definitely become a must-read once the movie comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"First off I would like to say I am a extreamly busy mom of two crazy wild boys who never has time to read. I read this book on the weekend and smiled the whole time! the house got trashed the kids ran amuk but I had to finish this book! luckaly my husband was home to entertain the kids, as well as dads do. :)Twilight is well thought out with real issues a lot of young kids deal with. I loved how the book had multible problems that were not black and white, good or bad the world in general has alot of grey arrea and so does the book.I can't believe there is anyone in the world who couldn't love this book. everyone I have talked to about it loves it *shrug* to each there own I guess.PS. I read the whole serries in 6 days! loved them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah...Pretty much the best book ever!","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! The whole series is amazing I don't care what anyone says! It has romance and action and not to fake mythological stuff! READ IT...that is all. (So excited for Midnight Sun!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, why not...","review":"I'll give it 4 stars. The book, after all, is written for high school kids! I bought the book due to movie hype. I do love reading first time authors, I find they are often an authors best books. I do plan to buy the next book, and have hopes that the author expands.Bottom line, I thought Stephanie Meyer caught the angst of high school romance, as if she graduated last June. I was transported back (was it really 40 years!), and was impressed with her ability to stir the memory of high school crushes. (Of course, this may be a down side, as an 'elder' reader I know the reality of high school loves, but I was reminded that at the time...) I also, must admit, I love a good vampire story. I've yet to find a decent vampire since Anne Rices' Interview With The Vampire & Vampire Lestat books, and the movie Dracula with Gary Oldman. This series has potential. Maybe I should reread Interview, but I have hope that Meyer will join the others as a good vampire story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight is BEST book I have read in years!!!","review":"I could not put this book down. I was captivated by Edward, and addicted to finding out every detail about what was going to happen next. The mystery and true love was brilliantly written and weaved through the whole story. I am dying for Stephenie Meyer to finish writing \\"Midnight Sun\\" which is \\"twilight\\" from Edwards perspective. I think it will push this saga over the top and I will read this book and the other sequels over and over!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book With Real Bite","review":"I am sitting here stunned by some of the rotten reviews that this book is getting. Twilight is a wonderful story. I am 35 years old, and it has been a long time since I found something that my 14 year old wanted to read so badly that I had to fight her for the book so I could finish it. Stephanie did a great job of writing this book and the series is amazing. With plot twists and fantastically fascinating characters, it hooks you right from the start. Yes, it is a Vampire romance, but honestly the book is about the love that Bella and Edward have for each other. Really, two misfits in their own right, falling for one another when all seems lost. I loved it and the entire series, I would HIGHLY recommend them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was worth the two days!","review":"I think this book was well worth the two days I spent reading it. I am excited to move on to the next. Stephenie Meyer has a real talent for painting a picture with her words. I feel she is a great writer. The story may be a little on the corny side, but then again I am not a young adult. I did thoroughly enjoy the book and didn't want to put it down. For those who complain of wasting their money, get a library card. It's free! Great job Stephenie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"The first in a multi-book series, this is what got me started, I lvoe the story, and Stephenie Meyers couldn't have written it any better. You, as the reader, take the position of Bella Swan and fall in love with the other characters including Edward Cullen, the quiet and exotic vampire. I can't wait until Breaking Dawn comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book.","review":"This is awful writing. This is an awful message to send to young girls: you are worthless until the person you love will love you back. Only then can you be happy / fulfilled. Gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are older than 13 - this will not do!!!","review":"This book is terrible. I can't see why it's so popular!A. There is nothing truly creative about it. Everything was already done before. Just a mix of other classical stories with a teenagers life.B. It's so repetitive with how handsome Edward is, that without it, the book would be HALF the size!Go see the movie...less waste of your time :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW READING","review":"I HAVEN'T FINISHED THE BOOK YET BUT IT KIND OF SLOW READING.IT'S LIKE READING SOMEONE'S DIARY.

THERE IS NOTHING GOINGON IN THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"I feel like I'm missing the Twilight gene, because I just don't get it. Several women in my book club really like this book and are on to the fourth in the series, but just seems like teen lit to me. Simplistic and unrealistic and a bit silly. Whatever. I don't have a burning desire to read the 2nd one or any more after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"After all the hype I had decided that I was never going to read this series (must be the rebel in me). However I was in the airport without anything to read on the flight and it was on the shelf so I decided to give in and read it. I should have stuck with my gut. The writing was juvenile at best and the story's pace was like being in a car with someone who is learning how to drive a stick alot of start, stop, start ,stop.A friend best summed this book up as \\"a trashy romance novel, without the trash\\". I have no doubt there is an audience for this book, but it is not something I would ever recommend to anyone and when I brought it into the office to try to give it away like I usually do with my airplane books I got absolutely no takers.There are lots better vampire and romance novels out there so don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's with all the hype?","review":"I wanted to really love this book because I love vampires and romance novels...but this is incredibly boring and dragged out. The premise of the book could make a really mind numbing experience but the author doesn't seem to put much thought into a main focus of the story. The characters are very typical and have no personality. The book just repeats itself until the last couple of chapters when they meet the random vampires. It's almost like the editor said \\"insert plot here\\" it seemed so disconnected. Ages ago I read Christopher Pikes Last Vampire series and even though that was aimed a little younger it was sooo much better and actually had real twists with consequences. If you want to somewhat enjoy this book skip the first half of filler. you won't miss much, all you need to know is Edward is hot and Bella is physically attracted him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guys, save yourself--chick-litt. lite!!!","review":"This book is basically a dime store teenage romance novel written in somewhat better than average style. The cover should feature a picture of teenage Fabio with fangs! Pure Drek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.....and not in a good way","review":"Okay, I finally caved and bought this book because it was apparently supposed to be good enough for a movie and it's one of the bestsellers these days. YAWNNNNNNN.....A boring book that is so repetitive with a rather trite and useless teenage heroine. The author does a great job of telling us that the vampires are super hot over and over and over and over again but we never really get more than that. The majority of the characters, including the first person narrator, Bella, are one-dimensional bores. Hell, I don't even think I'll sacrifice 2 hours of my life for the movie, this book sucked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight","review":"I enjoyed Twilight way more than I thought I would. I thought oh, come on a vampire romance? Augh. But then, I found it extremely hard to put down. It was uplifting, romantic, exciting, and scarey. My daughter has most of her friends reading it. I personally wouldn't mind reading it again. Excellent book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical","review":"Thiis story is sweet and sugary with danger to our little human as she loves a vampire. Most of the book is about them getting to know each other and learning to get close without endangering her life. BUT one night some wild vampires appear and their lives are endangered anyway when one of then decides to hunt Bella.This is a strangly addictive story. I couldn't put the book down and swallowed the huge book in a very short time. Well written the vampires are as beautiful as we would expect, the story in itself not being special but the way the author weaves her craft and makes it magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Review","review":"A friend gave me this book, and it's sequel, as a birthday gift. I was reading another book at the time, but as soon as I cracked open Twilight, the other book was long forgotten. I was hooked once I read to about the second chapter. I am convinced that if my schedule had been a little less hectic at the time, I could have easily found a cozy little spot somewhere and read the book from cover to cover. However, I didn't have time to do this, and so, I admitt, that I read Twilight by the light of my cell phone, on a school night, turning the pages as quietly as I could so as not to alert my mother, who probably thought that I had beeen asleep for hours. I reccomend this book to any and everyone. It is action-packed and impossible to put down. Definately one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!!","review":"I love Anne Rice's, \\"Vampire Chronicles,\\" and have found that i LOVED this book, as well.

I found the author had an excellent way of portraying each character. When I read the book, I felt as if I was really in the story.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good thrill!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible writing","review":"Just because this book was intended for the teenaged audience doesn't make it okay that the writing is grammatically spotty, cliched, and wordy. Here is an example of a sentence (one of hundreds) that the author and editor should be ashamed of: \\"I deliberated where I stood, wanting to return to him badly.\\" This literally means, \\"I thought about where I was standing, wanting my return to him to be a bad one.\\" Basic mistakes and a dull, long-winded story with one-dimensional, stereotyped characters made this an utter waste of my time. That the author is worth fifty million dollars scares me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the books, hated the movies","review":"Twilight is one of the most moving books I have read in a long time. It kept me thinking about it long after I read the last page. Its heartbreaking romance and suspenseful twists made it hard for me to put the book down.

This series, the Inheritance series by Christopher Paolini, and the Goose Girl series should be required reading for every young adult girl on the planet,"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must- read for fantasy/romance lovers","review":"I simply adore this book. I started reading it shortly after the 7th Harry Potter book was released and I got hooked on to it right away.I also read the second, New Moon, and the third Eclipse, and I'm waiting for the fourth, Breaking Dawn but simply can't!!!!It's got a fabulous storyline, it's fast-paced and just enchanting. I love it. And so do many other young teens, teens, and adults too.It talks about Bella, a 17 year girl who moves to Forks, a small town in WA that she hates. Here she meets Edward who is simply enchantingly beautiful. They fall in love and then Bella discovers that he's a vampire. But she doen't care. She loves him anyway.So fantasy/romance lovers who are 13 and over, hurry up and read this. You won't be disappointed at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book if you're into bad books","review":"I didn't like this book. I'm sorry, I didn't. The majority of what I was going to say has been said by Janeifer Drew earlier, but I'll touch on a few things.The style bothered me. I'm quite picky, so it may not be a big deal for all readers, but it feels labored and awkward more often than not.The characters feel unreal--especially the protagonist, Bella. She supposedly has attractive qualities, but we never see any sign of this beyond the fact that Edward's lusting after her. There's nothing that makes her a very appealing character; Meyer seems to have gone overboard on the real-people-have-flaws front by making Bella almost cripplingly clumsy to an unrealistic and eventually boring extent--as well as whiny, dependent, and kind of pathetic.Was it the worst book I've read? No. But would I recommend it? Only if you have more free time than I do to waste reading books that don't deserve the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameless rip off (and badly executed too)","review":"So I'm watching \\"True Blood\\" on HBO with my wife who's been reading the Twilight series, and she comments how that show seemed to rip off the \\"Twilight\\" books. No, not the sparkly vampires (are you kidding me?), the fact that one main character can read everybody else's minds except the other main character. In the INFINITELY better \\"True Blood\\", it's the female lead who can read everyone's minds except for the vampire she falls for.I was surprised that Allan Ball, who is a truly great writer, would stoop to ripping off a sad work of teen fiction. Yet, \\"True Blood\\" came out in 2008, the first Twilight book came out in 2007.Except that on further digging, I read that \\"True Blood\\" is based on a series of books that came out in 2001 called the \\"Southern Vampire Mysteries\\".There just is no justice in this world. How this book became so popular is just beyond me. Not only is it embarassingly bad, it practically ruins the whole genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"short & sweet","review":"Don't waste your time or money.

If it catches your eye or ear and you have ANY interest in reading it, buy the book immediately.

I don't care if your 14 or 44, this book will touch a place in your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIRLY AND BORING","review":"This is an overrated book! Seriously, 5 star reviews? Probably made mostly by teenage girls. All through Twilight I was annoyed by the weak, childish romance between an \\"airhead\\" teenage girl and a vampire.I tried to read this book, I gave it a chance. I always finish books I start to read, to have a complete and fair opinion of it, but I couldn't finish this book. I'm really glad I just bought the first book of the Saga, I would have had to return the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poorly written teen novel with inappropriate adult themes","review":"I've read many of the 1 star reviews of this book and agree wholeheartedly with them. I cannot understand how this book was published (at all) and marketed to the 12 and up market. The very thought of my daughter reading this book sends shivers down my spine for so many reasons. The redundancy of the text in this novel is downright boring. The only reason I persevered was to try and find out what all the hype was about. Having finished the book I was left scratching my head and wondering how on earth this book has become so popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get this at all","review":"This review will be short and simple, since so many other people have already excellently and eloquently explained why this book is bad. All I want to say is: I don't get it. Why is this so popular? Sure, it is obviously aimed at 14-17 year old girls, but writing for that age group doesn't mean that you have to come up with such lousy material. I am definitely not part of the target demographic, but I still do enjoy material for it as long as it is executed well. This isn't. So what is going on? Has there been an epidemic brain drain among adolescent girls?The only advantage for me personally is that I don't feel that bad anymore about my own novels. They may be lame, contrived and poorly written, but if even stuff like this tops the best-seller lists I may still have a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sexist YA Novel of the 21st Century","review":"Between the helpless female protagonist and her vampire stalking, controlling boyfriend; Twilight is enough to make any young feminist want to vomit. The purple prose Ms. Meyer uses in her book doesn't help either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Okay, I know there's a million reviews for this book, and this most likely won't even get read, but I just have to say that I love this book. I know he's a bit of a stalker, but it's a fiction book, and I love how devoted he is to Bella. To be loved by someone so much they refuse to live without you is amazing. Now, if he tied her up and wouldn't let her go, that would be different, but he loves her so much, he would walk away if that's what she wants. I think this is just an incredible love story in the fantasy genre. The best YA I've read in years. I finished all 4 books within days because I just couldn't stop reading them. Great series."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never read romance books...","review":"I remember someone telling me to get this for a beach trip. I thought, heck no, I don't like romance books much less I don't like books about silly vampires. But I loved reading this book and talking about it with my girlfriends. I don't even care about telling people that I loved it even though I'm in my 30s and it wasn't exactly written for my age group. It's fun to read and I love the idea that the author did with a vampire trying to be a good guy and that Edward is an old school gentleman. Maybe that's why older women enjoy reading it as well. Edward isn't your typical modern teen with no manners and saying \\"like\\" and \\"I mean\\" all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought","review":"I was skeptical starting, given the nature of the characters, but the new twist on an old idea was well done. It is a bit melodramatic, but a fun teen romance read. I look forward to getting the others and buzzing through them. A very quick, fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book to Read","review":"Twilight is an excellent book to read. It is highly descriptive and always seems to have a very good cliff hanger everytime it is possible. It is one of those books that keeps you up late at night telling yourself \\"just one more chapter\\". It is highly entertaining, so readers of any age will adore it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of realistic fiction, action, romance, fantasy, and just a hint of mystery. Twilight does, however, have some bad qualities. It shows new sides to the world we live in, and not everyone wants to read about them. Also, it is sort of a 'dark' book. Those who really don't like anything even a tiny bit scary probably won't enjoy it. But, Twilight is a wonderful book to read and I know I loved it. And I know that most you will too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"horrible readVapidIdiotic characters - worse writingcould not even get through the book without skipping whole paragraphs of how wonderful edward is *eye roll*Was hoping some sort of plot would develop, not sure if i saw one.CANNOT believe the hypeDoes it bother no one that a hundred + year old 'man' is stalking an underage girl?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't waste my money or time","review":"Thanks to those who provided the cautionary reviews as I had no idea what the big deal was about this book, especially after Oprah gave it her stamp of approval. I was planning to buy a copy. Thanks to \\"TinaMom\\" for her summary and I agree, we don't need books glamourizing stalking boyfriends. Very creepy. Great perspective \\"TinaMom\\" changing the vampire character to a stalking boyfriend so those who don't 'get it' can see how unsettling this story is for their daughters. Also, I detest poorly written books with grammatical errors, weak analogies and nonsensical descriptions. 'Somebody' is making ALOT of money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't knock it -- this book is a great read for any age...","review":"I am from an older generation -- a time when Edward's wanting to meet Bella's father before going out -- was the norm. I admit I took it all as fantasy, but I understood both of the characters personalities -- Edward came from a different time and was more ethical; Bella came from the present where morals are more loose. I totally fell in love with all the characters. You need to read the book before watching the movie to know the why's of some of the storyline. Edward had never had a girlfriend and didn't really know how to treat one, but you won't know that unless you read the book. Some of the special scenes that were left out of the movie, I feel should have been left in. It was really a great story for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"just no...","review":"I dont understand people comparing Harry Potter with Twilight...

I read this book in one evening- which is quite a feat, for 2 pages shy of 500! Yes, I had homework, but this book was too AMAZING to put down! Also, it was a relief to read a book that I am actually excited to share with my mother! The worst thing that happens is some passionate kissing, and it was written quite tastefully!

Hands down, the book is far better. I also have to admit this is the only vampire series I would think about reading. I'm just not that into vampire romances like some people. I know if I were merely a teenager, I probably would have thought this book to have been excellent, but alas, I'm just a grownup and can't bring myself to give this five stars ONLY because I felt the ending of it was RUSHED and thrown together.

Neither is obsession. Neither is having someone else control your life. Neither is having ones scent overwhelm another to the point they have no control over themselves.Seriously people, stalking, controllin and obsessive behavior is NOT romantic.If this book gets someone reading, that is good.

'\\"He was so beautiful\\", \\"Staring at me\\", \\"They were so pale, muscular and beautiful\\" bah.In the beginning I though that I was going to like it but after 100 pages it became boring and kind of stupid.This book is just too emotional( Its just a boring love story). When I finally reading the half book i couldn't keep reading. Books like Brisingr, Tolkien's middle-earth books are worth buying.Books like this and Harry Potter are just overestimated.

I love vampire books, so I'm normally fairly forgiving of them, but this one just wasn't very good, nor very interesting. It's a horribly wish fulfilling Mary-sue. I will admit that I felt a need to actually finish it and I might even read the sequel, but it's as much morbid curiousity.New girl shows up in town, all the boys fall in love with her. She spends more time worrying about fitting in than anything else until she falls for the mysterious and beautiful vampire in her class who has fallen madly in love with her for no particular reason.Now I can understand why teenagers like it, but the characters are flat, the descriptions of the faces rarely go beyond \\"unbelievably beautiful\\" and then giving a hair color. If you do read it, don't read it expecting a good vampire novel. It's just a standard teens falling madly in love and then angsting about it book."},{"rating":"1","title":"School Librarians View","review":"I read this book because all of the high school girls in my school have read it and kept asking me what I thought.By the end of it, the only thing I could say is \\"terrible dialogue\\", \\"stupid\\", and totally \\"unrealistic\\".This is all fine if you are an adult woman who just wants to fantasize for a bit and there are worse books out there. However, this book is geared for those geeky teenagers who are clumsy and a bit socially awkward and really want to believe that they can have a drop dead gorgeous boyfriend who sneaks into their bedroom at night to do nothing more than watch them and who gets upset when she french kisses him because he is getting to \\"turned on\\" and doesn't want to be.As I said, totally unrealistic.I tell my girls that there is just too much really good literature out there to waste you time on this one. I don't even mind if they read fluff, as long as the fluff has some redeeming value which in my humble opinion, this one does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a textbook I would use again","review":"My professors chose this as one of the texts for a graduate level course in Positive Psychology one semester and have since stopped using it. The book was easy to read, but not very applicable to the true intent of positive psychology research, despite it's name. Moreover, nearly every example was clinical, and focused on disorder. This may be a useful book to \\"ease\\" clinically minded students into the idea of positive psychology and does offer a table of contents that covers most of the important bases if you are looking to learn a little more about positive psych, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to serve as an introduction, or even supplemental higher level reading in positive psych for most courses. Chapters are lacking in content and tend to stray into more clinical topics rather than discuss what the chapter title promises. If you're looking for a positive psych text for students check out the Primer by Peterson or the big Snyder & Lopez text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positive Psychology","review":"A fairly technical book wrapped around the science of happiness, the measurement of happiness, and how that connects to a variety of human character strengths and virtues.

Honestly, I don't understand why they embraced it so lovingly. I found this book to be condescending and maleficent. It refers to real alchemists in name only, projecting an aura on them that sometimes borders on the ridiculous, as in the caliper of man that Becher was, or the origins of the Comte de St. Germaine. It thoroughly misinforms as well; the homonculus is not a extradimensional entity bent on the overthrow of God, for example. To find out what the homonculus really is, study Paracelsus. To learn more about Hermetic thought, read Dom Pernety, Flamel or Basil Valentine. It is also a violent and depressing book, and I don't really enjoy violence or depression, two emotions that I had in spades after finishing the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG Disappointment","review":"1 star is being generous in my opinion.

Being an intermediate baccarat player, this book had nothing insightful to offer someone like myself, I kept anticipating that the author would offer more in the ways of different money management systems that I could implement, along with different angles and strategies. This book did no such thing, it only included novice MM systems, 4/5 of the book seemed like fillers. Scoblete talked about the 'feeling' and 'enjoyment' you should get from playing baccarat and how to get the most of these feelings. Learning how to get comped and the seven deadly sins of gambling.

After the first three or four Anita Blake books, I vowed I would _never_ miss one. I wish I had broken my vow, most particularly for Micah. If, like me, you loved the edge, style and sheer craft of Hamilton's earlier work, you should check out Kim Harrison or Jim Butcher, or Kelley Armstrong. In fact, you probably already have.

Really Done.Here's a hint Ms. Hamilton, one should not WINCE repeatedly when reading a sex scene, it means that the scene IS NOT SEXY.Ms. Hamilton shows no signs of actually having a plot, a beginning, a middle, or an end in her last few books. She has stated on her website that her sales of this series went through the roof when she started including the sex, so she's just going to add more...and more...and more......So, spare yourself this rubbish and go and try J.R.

I'm however not used to pay it for 30 minutes of reading. Micah was short and yet very uninteresting. I think LKH might have lost it.. She was so talented once, I loved the first books. I bought this out of nostalgia, hoping that it would be a return to the mysteries and fun. It wasn't. Anita is still over the top powerful, especially the thing with all the were-viruses made me go \\"huh?\\". And not in a good way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Lazy Laurell?","review":"Admittedly the Vampire Hunter series isn't and wasn't meant to be high literature, but at least there was an effort put into previous books. This book was so short and formulaic it was like watching an episode of a TV show. I was greatly disappointed. At least the double spaced text and blank pages between each chapter meant that it only took me a couple hours to read, wasting very little of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The waste of a few decent trees","review":"Don't bother buying this. Really. Even if you like LKH / Anita Blake.It seems like a discarded long chapter from another book, reset into different larger typeface to make it feel like a book. The margins are huge, too.And the printing is the best thing I can say about Micah.Have you ever felt really disgusted after buying a book, having realized you were cheated or misled by both author and publisher? If not, then go ahead and waste your $7.99.Ms Hamilton, if you are reading this...please back away from the computer and go to Barbados. For a long, long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste of Paper and My Money","review":"Even one star is too many for this piece of junk.

But never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I love LKH. I've adored the last few books -- and I know I'm one of the few. But it's difficult to describe how little I care about Micah and his huge...er... endowment. Certainly not 200 pages worth. And especially not for full novel price.Seriously. This book was a rip-off. But then, that's getting more and more common with publishers these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah","review":"Totally agree with the other reviewers...and I'm so glad I borrowed the book from the library. I'm such a big fan of LKH and her books that I continue to read all that she offers. Too bad Micah isn't even good enough to be in a collection of stories. Is this another case of \\"churning\\" out a book (I can't even call it a \\"story\\") to meet a deadline for a paycheck? Harsh words, but NOT uncalled for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"When I first read that Laurell K. Hamilton was writing a book on Micah, I mistakenly thought that she might explore more of his background, or Anita and Micah would develop some new \\"depth\\" or power to their relationship. I liked the book well enough but I think it really could have been included as a chapter in a new book, because when I got done reading it, that was my first thought, why put it in a stand-alone novel, when it really isn't one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme disappointment","review":"I waited with great anticipation for the release of this latest book in the series, only to think that I was sent an incomplete novel when I ripped open the box. The book a very short; double-spaced with unnecessary pages for chapter numbers. In addition to being short the book adds zero depth to the story of Anita Blake. The last few books contained more sex than storyline but I held on to the hope that Laurell would redeem herself with Micah. I was wrong. The main topic of the book is the width of Micah's member and his tramatic past; which in comparison to the horrors that occurred before, is the least tramatic experience I have read throughout the series. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed, unentertained (I finished the book in two hours) and you will be too. Rather than \\"force\\" a book Laurell take a break and save everyone time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"Thank god I got this from the library and didn't buy it. It's terrible. And the ending is so abrupt I turned the next page expecting to read more and was shocked that the book was over. The sex is icky and there's little else in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"enjoyable but incomplete","review":"Felt more of an expanded short story. The expanded print spacing is reminiscent of high school papers, in trying to make a 3 page report stretch into 5 pages. Two obvious story threads could have been expanded on to bring this up to her usual caliber:1) mafia tie-in from the shooting2) Franklin possibly having untrained gifts to deal withThis one properly belonged in one of the multi-author story collections.

I LOVED the first ones, but had started to get a little disappointed by Narcissus In Chains and it went downhill from there. The last book, Micah, is the biggest disappointment of all. Not only is the book short, not only is the book large spaced in format, it's not any good. There is no plot, just one sex scene to the next - which isn't bad when there is a real story line, but REALLY bad when it's just sex for the sake of sex. I feel like I wasted $7.99 on the paperback. I feel cheated by Laurell Hamilton. Just sign me Disappointed Douglasville lady."},{"rating":"1","title":"A response to \\"Curse you Diana Gabaldon\\"","review":"A little known dirty secret told to me by a friend who once worked in the publishing industry - named authors are either monetarily compensated or it's a part of their contract to positively plug other authors in the same \\"house\\" and genre. bottom line is, when looking at reviews to help you determine what to spend your hard-earned money on, look to your fellow customers. We will tell you the truth...our livelihoods don't depend on it, even if our favorite author's does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So very boring and a waste of my time","review":"This was the first novel I have read by Hamilton. It sounded interesting and I am just getting into these type of novels. Big mistake! I am glad that I got this book from the library. I would have been pissed if I would have spent money on this book. It didnt make any sense to me and it was just boring. I thought this book was going to be about vampires and reincarnations and action and STUFF! But it had none of that. Anita was a big whiner! Her character irked me. I frown just thinking about her. This book does not make me want to read another book by Hamiliton, about Anita and definately nothing about Micah. I feel sorry for anyone who spent money on this book. I havent been this disappointed in a novel in ages!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the usual quality.","review":"I just discovered this series---read 5 of them then ordered the rest. There is lots of great sex and violence---it has been a fun month reading all 18 books---but of all of them---I should have skipped this one. It was really a short story---excessive line space and margins. I read the whole thing in an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"I can't believe I spend over $6 for this novella that only took me about an hour to read. Very disappointing with a thin plot and no substance. I agree with the reviewer who said it's like a term paper that someone was rushing to get done in time and have enough pages. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah Missed","review":"I actually like Micah. I was excited about this book, desperately hoping that it would bring into light what for me is a mysterious and engaging character. It missed that mark. Completely. There is no plot. That would be okay if the book was a nice, introspective look at Micah, but it isn't. It's merely another outlet for the same old Anita emotional issues that we all hope she'll grow out of. Because that's what characteres do - they grow and not just in power.I think Hamilton is a very gifted storyteller who probably was under a lot of pressure from her publisher. I look forward to the book in June, and I hope that it will give us more of Micah. However, after the sneak peek offered in today's release I'm afraid I won't be getting what I want.Lastly, I don't appreciate paying $7.99 for an hour and a half read. No, sir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Like a lot of other people said: short, gross sex, boring plot and too much of Anita complaining. This book is the worse of the series. I don't think it should even qualify as a book, more like a bad short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took a chance","review":"I have read many of Hamilton's books and bought the book against all the bad reviews. Worst book I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this series, but....","review":"I love this series, and I loved this book, but....It felt almost like an outline of a storyline idea without all the parts filled in!It was a very enjoyable book, as they all are, it just left me wishing there were at least another 200 or so more pages with more details about Micah. We found out that he has a family, but not why he has no contact with them. That is just one example - I won't list any others as to not spoil it for others! But little things like that just made the book feel unfinished.Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah and his huge _____","review":"This short book was very disappointing. The plot was shallow. The climactic action was boring, compared to other books in the series.Additionally, I felt that this book was little more than thinly disguised porn. I read waay too much about Micah's member and bedroom skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"small book, big err....","review":"I like the character Micah. I'm really bored with hearing about his, err, outstandingly large physical attributes. In fact, I'd love for a character in one of Ms Hamilton's books to be average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I've read many of the Hamilton books over time and have to agree with many of the recent reviews stating that she is slacking and I would argee. Micah is a good example the exposition in the novel is low and when this characters back story is related it seems enemic at best. Richard and Jean Claude's had more revealed in one novel than Micah has had revealed in the past 3. I don't know what events are occuring in the writers personal life but if she is putting out mediocre novels to fill contract then she's going to lose a great deal of readers when she goes to a new publisher. I would recommend Jim Butcher for the time being till Hamilton's writing gets back to par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been one chapter","review":"Micah is my least favorite man in the Anita Blake series. He's boring. I bought this book hoping it would have some more growing experiences for Anita but it didn't. I think this could have been condensed into one chapter in the next book of the series. I suggest getting it at the library or used instead of paying full price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good grief","review":"Thankfully I borrowed this one from a friend. I vowed 4 books ago that I would never buy any of her stuff new - only used or borrowed. Not that I don't respect her as an author (I keep reading don't I?) it's just that I've had too many disappointments.This book is short. I read it in a couple hours and was like 'wait, that's it?' It seemed as though I had read a chapter from one of her other books. Like other reviewers mentioned - only 1 half axxed zombie raising and 1 sex scene (gosh I miss Jean-Claude). That's it. Some moaning and groaning about her insecurities, but that was all folks. Since you can pick up just about any of her books and not feel lost in the series, I recommend skipping this one. Unless someone loans it to you to read while waiting for the dentist or in traffic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms Hamilton was better before she got married.","review":"We certainly can make a case for author's not getting married or divorced.I have seen examples where good authors who were married, thanked their spouses for all their patience, etc in first few books. Then a divorce occurred, and their writting stunk from that time on.Only in this case, I think marriage did Ms Hamilton in. A couple years ago, I noted with interest and good wishes that she had gotten married, but since then her writting has suffered and continues to suffer.Go, rent a cottage at beach, a cabin in the mountains! Do whatever it takes to get back your muse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author??","review":"Seriously, who the heck was the author of this book? There is no possible way this was written by LKH. I absolutely loved this series, and lately they've been going downhill but this book was so horribly written and so completely different from all the other books that it could not have been written by LKH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"Nothing happens. Anita discusses the nature of relationships with Micah. And they have sex. For the entire book.At the very end, she reanimates a corpse, and hilarity ensues.But for the most part, it's just that conversation about feelings that you've been avoiding with your partner. Skip it and move on.(not the conversation, though, that's one of those boring things about relationships that should probably happen in real life, but doesn't make for interesting storytelling)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well be a Harlequin","review":"I officially stop reading the series with this book. The Anita Blake we know and love is gone. There is no more animator raising an entire graveyard and declaring herself to be a necromancer. The series started so well and now all she ever does is have sex from the start of the book to the finish. The ardeur has ruined a great series. To anyone who wants to try the series, read the first 8 books or so and call it quits before it gets painfully bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"More please","review":"I have read all of Laurel's published work and have enjoyed them all. The length of Micah is my greatest concern, it shows as 245p, but you can breeze through it in about 50 min. A fairly light read compared to the other works. This is about the same as the previous 3 books as far as character development, emphasized over plot guided work, which is not bad as long as it is mixed up with changes over time. I hope that if any further works are done in a short format that they are more filling; 2 hours would be a decent read for a short format. The equivalent to about a third of Incubus Dreams. Thanks for the book, hope there are more in the future following DM and it's release in July."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as others in this series","review":"I was pretty disappointed in this book. It seemed as if Ms. Hamilton was required to write a book for her publisher, so she simply shot this one out. It wasn't very inspired or interesting. I actually finished the book in two evenings reads (and I work full time and have an infant...so I don't stay up that late). I hope her next installment gives me bit more storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah was a pale contender to previous Anita books","review":"Micah was a pale contender to previous Anita books- There was very little action...outside of the bedroom anyway..I like a little heat..but the plots from the first few books are what I became obsessed with. I couldn't put the books down...the Micah installment, I felt, was rushed..with little to no plot, or action. No evil to overcome. Just disappointing.I was weary of even reading the books after some of the reviews I have read. And although I have started liking Micah, and accepted that Anita and Richard won't work out..this book was a letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"short but not sweet.

But no !!! It's about Anita having to take over a job as a favor to her friend Larry. She flies to Philadelphia to raise a zombie.

When I saw how thin the book was I hesitated buying it. $7 (i think) dollars for such a thin novel. But I choose to spend the money anyway trusting that it would be wonderful. It wasn't. It was pretty sad. I mean Micah - I'd been wanting to know more about this character. The whole book just disapponted me. I'm hopeing that the next one is better but from the reviews I just read I'm not so sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Series Gone to Trash","review":"I was a fan of Anita Blake through the first 4 books and then...these started out as romantic novels with interesting value twists, lots of action and great sex - now we have a character who whose whole purpose in life is to sleep with anything (and I do mean plant, animal or mineral) that comes along. What happened to hunting down the bad guys. The only bad guys in the last few novels are those Anita doesn't want to sleep with or who won't sleep with her.

Great series gone bad and getting even worse - shame on your Laurel."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother wasting the money","review":"I am a big Laurell K Hamilton fan....but this one bites the big one. There is absolutely no plot, no story, and one sex tryst. Why bother Laurell? First of all I've never been a fan of Micah.

And that her mystical link to Richard and the vampire permit her to heal from extremely rough sex very quickly.Why do I keep reading Ms. Hamilton's books? Maybe because I hope that eventually she'll leave the sexathons behind and return to the interesting plots.Unfortunately, as I mentioned previously, this is not the book for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to the beginning....","review":"Briefly, this book and the last two or so suffer from the same problems....not enough of what made Anita Blake interesting and too much focus on her sexual life. Ms. Hamilton, please go back and re-read your first 2 or 3 books and get back to the basics. What made Anita Blake so interesting was her fights against the supernatural using her own emerging understanding of her powers, but often relying on good old fashioned fighting skills. Please get bqack to the basics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pint size romp","review":"Anita Blake's world has become a romp through endless manic musing, sex, fighting, sex and power trips. Since I love and cherish LKH's first 8 books I decided to read Micah. BIG WASTE OF TIME.I gave this short story 2 stars because I controlled myself and so did Laurell. I did not buy it (stayed true to my vow), and because LKH wrote only 1 gross sex(not lovemaking)scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novella in a novels clothing.","review":"The book purports to be over 200 pages. Well if you take out the 2-3 pages required for each chapter heading and remove the double spacing -- you would be lucky to end up with 100 pages. This story would/should have been a decent 2nd story line in a complete novel, but it does not stand alone very well.I have read much of Ms. Hamilton's work and this is the first time I have felt cheated out of nearly $8! I mostly blame the publishers who should not have printed this as is. I suspect that money was a big motivator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large margins and blank pages = poor value for $","review":"This story starts off with lots of potential. FBI agents and a federal witness being raised. But then the plot takes a back seat to \\"feeding the ardeur.\\" Enough already with the ardeur! How about Anita becomming a master nacromancer, not taking off her clothes in public. This series needs to get back on track. Back to hunting and exterminating the bad guys, not laying around in bed all day! Please, I want to anticipate the next book like I used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Poor","review":"I really think this author is losing her way with this series. Even compared to the horrible Incubus Dreams, this book is pretty slap dash at best. Granted there was only one sex scene, which was a blessing in more ways than one way considering how bizarre and unerotic it was, there were still plenty of other problems ready to fill its place.In my opinion this book would have benefited a lot from having Micah as the narrator. Hes been a one dimensional character for so long and I think it would have helped a lot of readers accept him. Instead we got a generic back story that was hardly enlightening and Anita bitching at him for the first hundred pages because he booked a fancy hotel room! Nice.I also strongly feel that Anita needs to be retired as the voice of this series. Shes a repulsive character and has gone as far as she needs to go. Get rid of her! Start fresh with someone new cus Anita is a dead horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Interesting Piece of Information","review":"Do not read this if you really want to read the book.

This book was nothing more than a tease, filled with relentless drivel about a character that has done nothing throughout any of her books except take his shirt off and feed Anita's Sex disease called the Ardeur. One star for this book seems generous. Laurel!!!!! when can we get back to the times of vampire slayings and Edward and spend less time in the bedroom watching Anita explore the world of a porn star. Lets face it, if we wanted to read a hustler magazine we could get that at the local 7eleven.I haven't given up hope though, we all know what Hamilton can do with her stories. Let's hope that Danse Macabre and her next Gentry novel aren't more practice runs for submissions to Hustler and Penthouse Forums!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this after having just finished \\"Kiss of Shadows\\", which was a great imaginative story (5 stars!) If I could give this \\"0\\" stars I would. Little character development and a nonexistant plot - don't waste your money. I won't attempt any more of the Anita Blake series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story posing as novel","review":"I have read everything ever written by Laurell Hamilton, and this is the first time I have ever felt ripped off. While the story is entertaining, I do not expect to pay $7.99 for what could kindly be called a novella, but is really nothing more than a short story. The paperback is numbered at 280 pages, but the story actually starts halfway down page 3 and each chapter heading page takes up one page labeled \\"Chapter _\\", with a full blank page on the other side. Each new \\"chapter\\" also starts halfway down the page and usually ends at the halfway point on the last page. In addition, the entire book is printed double spaced in a large font, with large margins at the top and bottom. Both the publisher and Ms. Hamilton need to get their act together and not rip off loyal readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it weren't so boring...","review":"If the book weren't so boring, it'd be too short. After finishing it in about two hours I think it is safe to say that the Anita Blake we used to know, the Dr. Seuss spouting wise-cracker, is long dead and certainly forgotten.Don't let this miserable title clutter up your bookshelves; it looks like a trashy romance paperback because that's exactly what it is. If you never cared for the old plots and mechanics of the Anitaverse then consider MICAH. But be warned: not even the sex will deliver in this colossal failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah waste of time; Waiting on Danse Macabre","review":"I agree with the previous reviews that thought \\"Micah\\" was a waste of trees. Hamilton is a fantastic, creative writer- I even like the straight sex and her attitude toward queer folk is thoughtful, if parochial, and in character for Anita.In Micah, like some of Hamilton's short stories, the plot is an excuse to dive into sex and character-relationship development. The strength of her earlier work is the integration where the sexuality of her characters works with the plot. As noted in another review, the last Merry Gentry volume also fell down this weak path.Micah reads much more like a bodice-ripper, romance novel (of the trivial kind) and even the typesetting and layout has gone that route. I don't blame Hamilton for marketing what will become her retirement account- this is publishing after all.But borrow it from your public library if you must; it's not worth the cover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I own all the Anita Blake books in paperback. I may be willing to pay $7.99 for a full length book, but no longer will I spend that amount on one of Hamilton's novellas. I bought this book with a giftcard and only spent $2 on it. It cost too much. I read it in less than two hours and found it extremely dissatisfying. Considering its length and price, I am extremely surprised it is #1 in so many book charts.I expected more details about Micah and was disappointed that the goings-on in the cemetary - where the only action was, were not well developed. I was left with many questions of what was going on, and frankly, I could care less about the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack","review":"this \\"book\\" would have been better suited as a short story in a sex/horror anthology, or a letter to penthouse.instead, it's a disgrace to once glorious character.i told myself i'd give anita one more chance. and laurell blew it. literally.i no longer care."},{"rating":"1","title":"throwing the dogs a meatless bone","review":"i felt cheated after reading \\"Micah\\".yeah, I'm shameless when I say that I *love* Laurell K. for her tongue-in-cheek [...]...but there is exactly ONE sex episode-with Micah (chpts 7 & 8 to be exact) in the whole frellin' book.

Quick, easy reads chocked full of suspense and all the vampire, werewolf and other deadly creatures you crave to read about. Ms. Hamilton delves into areas most haven't tackled. I love all her books and have read most of the 20 Anita Blake novels. Can't go wrong with these if you are into this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who is Micah?","review":"I ask the question, Who is Micah, because after reading this very short novel I still do not know Micah's character. Anita is so nasty that it is very hard to become interested in the story. She is the narrator which is even worse. Micah should have been the one to tell his story, if indeed Hamilton actually intended to write about Micah - which she obviously did not. Anita Blake was my first foray into romance/paranormal/science fiction, and I loved the series until the last few books. Now that I have become an avid reader of all types of romance novels, I don't think Hamilton's way of telling a story is that great. She bores me by repeating her tired scenerios of sex and angst. What happened to adventure and excitement? Get Anita back on track or do her and readers a favor and kill her and the series off."},{"rating":"1","title":"can I rate this book as <1?","review":"I am a huge fan of Laurell Hamilton- Anita Blake has to be one of my favorite characters of all time- needless to say I was incredibly excited for this latest addition- HOW DISAPPOINTED was I once I read it!!!!!!!!!!!! This book is horrid!!!! The feeling that I got from the first page on was of a teenager desperately pumping out as many descriptive terms that describe nothing in order to meet the requirements of a 1000 word essay. The gripping, exciting, page-turning stories that I've come to expect from L.H? Non-existant. I am incredibly disappointed in this collect of paper that I purchased. Don't buy this book - especially if it's your first experience with AH! You'll never read another one of her books if you read this one first!!!!!!!!!!!! Shame on you LH for subjecting your loyal fans to this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story, NOT a novel worth full price","review":"This book is definitely the worst of the series so far. There is nothing of substance in it and you can skip it. After reading the one before it at over 600 pages, this one says 240+ but reads much more like a short story. Definitely not worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I have to admit. I did not buy this novel. It was given to me. For that I'm thankful I didn't have to shell out money for it. I was expecting more about Micah and his backstory, instead I got backstory on how big he was. Sorry not interested. One thing that allowed me to give it two stars instead of one, is that, for a surprising change, there is a bit of a plot to this novel and it wasn't filled with the standard unnecessary 'romantic' scenes. LKH continues to disappoint this fan who used to love her story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking, for lack of a better word","review":"I was given this kindle version as a gift, and let's just say I'm glad it was a gift. For one, nothing happened except some intimate situations between Michah and Anita (surprise!). The book was so short, that I actually had to skim back and check the download to see if there had been a glitch. I finished reading the entire book in under three hours. Really - and I wasn't even trying. I'd consider this a short novella at best, and was very disappointed to have wasted time reading this little offshoot that did nothing to push the series forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah - we (still) barely know ya...","review":"I think most of the rest of the reviewers have already hit the main point - this \\"book\\" isn't a book - it's a short story, and not a very deep one at that. While the premise is that we'll learn more about Micah, and you think that she'll flesh out his background and character, that really doesn't happen, except very superficially. Compared to the early books in the series, this is definitely a disappointment, even as a short story. I ran through it very quickly, and have no urge to re-read it.If you're the type of person who must have each book to finish a series (and heck, I'm usually like that too)... my suggestion is to pick up a used copy - my guess is that there will be a lot of them floating around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Laurell K. Hamilton novel I've read","review":"Micah is, by Hamilton standards, little more than a short story. Not much plot, 3 chapters on one sex act alone (I skipped most of it), no buildup to the end and a very dud of an ending. Ms. Hamilton is capable of very much more. Her earliest novels in this series were the best. In her latest novels, the focus on erotica, lots and lots of fetish (blood & pain) erotica. I like her writing when she is describing Anita Blake in action, other than sexually, and enjoy the twists and turns of the plots. But the recent focus, obssession really, on fetish-like sex is beginning to make reading her novels uncomfortable.This particular novel includes that obssessive focus on extreme sex but very little of anything else. I'm very disappointed with this effort and hope her future novels are back on track - with considerably less emphasis on extreme sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I was so hoping that this book was going to be good and that at some point maybe Anita and Micah were going to come to some kind of moment where maybe she was going to loose him or choose him. I read through it pretty fast and when I finished the end of chapter 12 and that was it, I thought \\"oh wait, the whole book didn't download\\" I even went as far as to calling customer service to see if they could fix the problem. So then I got my hands on the paperback for this book and low and behold the book only went to chapter 12. I was like \\"WTH\\" disappointment, such disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the plot?","review":"This was a terrible disappointment and the catalyst for me completely quitting this series. What started originally as a highly entertaining series about a smart, tough, and savvy detective has turned into nothing more than a book composed mainly of sex scenes and something of a story running about somewhere. There was hardly any plot to this book with the final scene both non-climactic and out of character for Anita Blake. She's had become nobody close to what was originally portrayed in the first few books and seems to always be in heat looking for her next sexual encounter and completely turning into a wimp. If you want to read some juicy sex scenes and don't precisely care whether or not an actual plot is occurring, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never disappointed!!!!!","review":"This book was a fantastic filler for between books. I love Laurell's books, and I am never diappointed. Micah was the central love in this book, and it let the reader know more about Micah's past. He is a sweet and tragic hero. I can't wait for the next installment in the Anita Blake series."},{"rating":"1","title":"I used to love Laurel K Hamilton's books but not anymore..............","review":"All her books have become thinly veiled storylines designed as transitions from one sex scene to another. I like erotica and romance as much as anyone but I need to have a coherent plot to go along with them. LKH used to be an inventive, wonderful writer and I anticipated each new release. Not any more. I don't buy the books anymore and only read them once the library has them available. And even then they aren't worth the time it takes to read them. Please, Laurel, go back to writing the way you used to! More plot, less porn!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying.","review":"I was so excited when I spotted 'Micah' in the store. Not too thick, but I envisioned a happy evening curled up reading it. Not quite. An hour later, I was left wondering what had happened to the rest of the book! It's double spaced, the last THIRTY pages are a teaser for the next novel, and each 'chapter break' takes up three pages. It's a barely-100-page-novella masquerading as an actual book. This would have fit far better in a short story compilation. It certainly wasn't worth $7.99. I'm considering returning it, actually - maybe something else will give me my money's worth, since this one didn't!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where has anita blake gone :(","review":"from a bad beginning (a fed questioning her about rumors and she says \\"anyone who says anything bad about me didn't get to f*** me\\" what? where did that come from?) to a disappointing ending (she's unconcious during the zombie scene) where has the anita blake i grew to love gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real Anita Blake please stand up?","review":"What is happening to this series? I love the Anita Blake books so much it hurts me to write this.Micah is a nice guy, with a hot body, but that is where the description ends. Even in this book the new things the reader learns about him just aren't that interesting. I would trade all the sex in the last two books for some good solid plot. I'm not saying take the sex out entirely, but at least give us a break between guys. If I'm reading five or six sex scenes a book, they're not erotic anymore, they are just plain annoying. Even the one sex scene in this book is weird. The only part that I liked about this book was the fact that Anita is getting back into her zombie raising.Buy the book if you are a die hard fan, and hope that Laurell gets the series back on track. Otherwise, it isn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a good thing it was short!","review":"A reading friend of mine calls these newer LKH books \\"boring porn\\" and sadly enough I'm finding her statement very true. I liked the fact that Anita Blake actually got back to her zombie raising roots this time around and even did a little work for a change but there was far too much focus on Micah's eye color, his gorgeous bod, his big male part and his skill at lovemaking. Does anyone following this series truly care at this point? I know I lost interest. More gore, a little plot and much less boring sex please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!","review":"I must agree with the majority of the other reviewers. This booklet (it's not even long enough to be a full book) is wooden at best, and far too short. It feels as though the author was just cranking out enough to keep the readers happy, but didn't really care about the material.This is the first book that I actually regret buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"(Spoilers: kind of) It will take a necromancer to raise the series","review":"I cannot call this a novel. It is too short, with no real plot and/or character development, and a lack of anything that makes me desire to re-read it.*** Semi-Spoiler ***In the whole book, only 3 things happen with any meaning what so ever.1) We find out that Laur... I mean Anita, is getting some.2) Anita and Micah spend some alone time together talking about some bad stuff from their pasts and having a big sex night.3) We find out Anita is becoming more powerful and that Micah's power interacts with hers.This is the limit of what is in this book. There is a small case, but Ms. Hamilton spends none of the time developing the backstories and characters like she has in the past. I was sorely disappointed and will not purchase this one. I only borrowed it from another disappointed friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plot?.......Not!","review":"I actually don't mind that the Anita Blake books have lots of sex. I just wish that the later ones had lots of actual story in them. Micah doesn't work for me on either count. There was a half-hearted explanation of why what happened happened in the last two pages or so. This was also the case with the book before this one. Too bad that this series has gone this way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am with Avid Reader","review":"I am completly in agreement with Avid Reader. I think that they were trying to extend her latest novel into two books and did a poor job. It did not advance the plot (such as it has been lately) and I sincerely hope that Danse Macbre is better....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this a chapter in Danse Macabre that she discarded?","review":"I think that this book must have been a few chapters of her next book Danse Macabre that she decided not to use. There really isn't much of a plot. There really isn't much of anything. The book looks short, but the lettering is large and there are blank pages in between chapters to make the book look longer than it truly is. I'm just glad this book came out in paperback and not in hardback.I was really looking forward to a book about Micah. I haven't learned enough about him yet to really like him as a character, and I wanted that to change.I guess I'll have to wait for Danse Macabre, though I'll probably be just as disappointed in that one as I was in Incubus Dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Micah by Laurell K. Hamilton","review":"Micah was not one of the best books of the Anita Blake series but without it you would get lost between Incubus Dreams and Macre (I can never remember the last word lol). Anyways, I was pleased with this book because you also get to see a different side of Micah Callahan."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After reading the reviews here, I decided to get this from the library, and am I ever glad I did. The story itself is decent, but it really does nothing to further our understanding of any of the characters. When I finished the book, it was like \\"this is it?\\" WTF. Yes, it is double spaced, and there's at least 2 blank pages inbetween chapters. I read the entire book waiting for a haircut at Supercuts, thats how short it is. Two stars because the story itself is sort of ok, although I was expecting more background on Micah, and it just wasnt there. There really was absolutly no point to this book, and its way, way too short to be full priced. It might have worked as an eBook that could have been printed at the back of Danse Macabre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Necromancer In A Shell","review":"I was excited to see that a new LKH book was out - for some reason this one flew under my radar. I wish perhaps it had stayed under my radar.Imagine your best friend told you they had a great book they wanted you to read. Imagine that they then hand you that book....and while the book has a hardcover and a thick spine, there are only two or three chapters inside. That's 'Micah' - the book that would be more suited to a B or C story in another Anita Blake novel, and not as a stand alone. The publisher's have tried hard to make it look like a book: the print is large, it's double spaced....but the story can't hold up. It is literally two or three chapters spaced out and spread out to make a whole book.Of course, don't take my word for it and avoid the book. You'll have to read it for yourself. I did. Because it's not bad. It's just a breadcrumb instead of the loaf of bread you were perhaps expecting."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I love LKH books I own everything in print... but this one just well... was bad. I think LKH needs to go back and reread her first books in the Anita Blake series. If this one comes out with a few other short stories than maybe it would be worth the money but by itself its not worth it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wishing for the old days","review":"I have read all the Anita Blake series books. Seems they have steadily gone downhill. There used to have plots, now they are just sex. Don't get me wrong, I loved the old sex scenes, but that was when there was also a story going on that didn't revolve around them.Wishing for the old days when Anita didn't have sex everything in pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First Anita Blake Experience.....my last?","review":"This is the first Laurell K. Hamilton book that I have read. Saying that - It might have been my last if I hadn't heard so much great things about the earlier Anita Blake novels. I guess I will have to go back and read from the beginning to know if I really like her style.I felt the book ended VERY abruptly and without really making me want more. I hate picking up in the middle of a series because I feel that I have missed key character development and some of the experience of the book is taken away....but by reading this book first I don't feel that this has happened. I will start at the beginning and move on hopefully with better results.I recommend: All of Karen Moning's Highlander Series, MaryJanice Davidson's Undead Series and anything by Sherrilyn Kenyon/Kinley Macgregor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book adds nothing to the series","review":"How can anyone think there is enough content on this book to be sold I don't know.The entire book should have being added to another book. It is just a freaking money maker to the author and publishers. It adds nothing to the series. It is really, really, not worthy to spend your money on it.The books before this one are great. I really enjoyed each one of them. But, this one is a mockery to the readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"l-a-m-e","review":"Sadly, as the series has progressed, the books have gotten suckier. This was one of the most disappointing. 155 pages of crap based upon a quick backstory of how Micah became a wereleopard followed by the usual cheaply written soft core porn and watered down plot that LKH has been doing these days. What gives? Where is the Anita Blake series that rocked our socks off in the beginning? Don't bother buying this book. For that matter, don't bother borrowing it from a local library. It's THAT disappointing. Took all of a day to read and at this point, I feel slighted of that time that I can never recover."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel fleeced (I actually paid cover price for this).","review":"As a big fan of all the other Anita Blake books so far published, I'm disappointed with \\"Micah\\".\\"Micah\\" reads more like an enormously over-padded short story than it does a novel. All of Micah would fit neatly in two chapters in any of the other books in the series. Pricing this as if it were an actual novel, the equal of any of the others in the series, is ridiculous. Hamilton and her publishers ought to be ashamed of themselves.If you simply must read it, pick it up used, and try not to pay more than $2 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I'm a big Anita Blake fan and was eagerly looking forward to the next novel. MICAH was a huge disappointment. Looks like the author had a contractual obligation and threw in a huge amount of gratuitous sex with NO plot or story line, and turned a short story into a book by including part of her next book at the end. Nothing about any of the other friends, men, characters in her life. Only Nathaniel (barely) and Micah. Very disappointed--not worth reading, really. Does not move the plot line of Anita's life along at all. Laurell, this one was a copout. Hope you put some more effort into the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars,worth $.03, should be rewritten as a 3 page short story","review":"Severely disappointing. The plot would work for a 3 page short story. I love the dynamics, ingenuity, and strong-arm approach of Anita Blake in the earlier stories, but this is an embarrassment for which the author should refund the money and apologize to her avid and faithful readers. Next time I will surely read the reviews before I purchase anything by this author. Laurell K. Hamilton, you have annihilated your reputation in exchange for the dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those poor trees","review":"The padded pages, thin plot, and Anita's bloated inner monologues ruin this book. The new info about Micah could have easily been added to one of the main books. I see no reason why LKH wrote this \\"novella\\" unless she wanted some extra cash.I suggest someone plant a tree to make up for all the wasted paper used to pad this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wont buy any more","review":"This book had about 10 pages of story and 300 pages of sex. Laurell Hamilton has completely lost the story telling ability that made the first 7 or 8 books in this series (up through Obsidian Butterfly) really good reading. The last few books were really bad, nothing but kinky sex with a few pages of interesting plot. I wont buy any more of this series (and I have the entire series to this point) until the author goes back to the original style that first drew me to the series. This series for the last several years has been on my automatic pre-order list, but has now been dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off","review":"The font is about 3 times the normal size to make up for a story that is less than 1/5th the normal plot length. This is a subplot made into a book. It makes you wonder whether L.K. Hamilton has simply lost all desire to write about these characters, or has decided that we are all just gullible enough to buy her books regardless of the quality or effort that goes into their creation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you're money...","review":"First off, I just want to say that I do like Micah (not the book, the character) but I'd like him a whole lot more if he wasn't such a yes man. You'd think that considering how much LKH seems to like him that he would do a lot more than just follow Anita around, never arguing with her, never questioning her, always ready to do what she says. It's as if LKH forgot that he was actually supposed to be a character instead of a plot twist.I mean the book is called \\"Micah\\" so shouldn't it have been about Micah? The only thing we really learn is that he was brutally attacked when he was made into a were-leopard and that he had some problems with the ladies due to his enormous, um......well, you get the picture. Nothing worth writing a book about.It's sad, an entire book about Micah and (if it's even possible) LKH made him into even less of a believeable person and more into a living, breathing, blow-up doll. How does she do it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never have I felt cheated before","review":"I have been disappointed in books before - some of the later Anita Blake books, some of the wheel of time books and others.At no point have I felt ripped off - this book made me feel like I was ripped off. It's not a book - it's several scenes.8 bucks for this? there was no plot. there was no character development. There was no tension. There was nothing, except a car trip, a sex scene, a zombie raising scene and a lot of talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd read the reviews first...","review":"I bought this in the airport when my flight was delayed. I wish I hadn't. Aside from paying full price for a book that is double-spaced, large type, and has wide margins, the story wasn't there. Too much sex, not enough zombie. Anita is barely likeable anymore. The others have gone into the details very well so I won't bother.I wish I could trade this book in as a coupon for a full-length, good quality Anita Blake story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woulda been good as a long short story","review":"A quick glance at the printed book will reveal the principal flaw: it is somewhat short on content. The text is double (or more) spaced with REALLY generous margins. So, when the typesetting is done efficiently, MICAH is about 60 pages or so of normal text.Hamillton also makes use of a \\"while you were in a coma\\" construct to resolve a major conflict.For shame, Laurell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You call this a novel??","review":"I love this series and own each book in it, so naturally I purchased the book with high hopes. I was *very* disappointed at the brevity of the story, how incomplete it was, and the overwhelming sense of the author rushing to get out a story by her deadline and to plug her next hardback novel. Shame on you Ms. Hamilton for cheating your fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah","review":"I liked learning about the character Micah and his origins but overall thought this book was weak. There was a lot of potential that wasn't fully realized. The sex really took over everything and I think from this book on in the series is where story starts to suffer versus the sex. I understand that the powers of Anita, Jean-Claude and Richard grow through sex and blood but I enjoy more story than this book provided. There's nothing wrong with a little spice but this book went too far with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ripoff","review":"I am a long-time LKH fan but I am becoming progressively disenchanted with the author's fixation with dragging her heroine Anita Blake through numerous and lenghty sexual escapades. LKH's sex scenes have become predictable, excessive and frankly boring. I would like a bit more story/action and a lot less gratitious sex. I preferred an Anita who was struggling with the implications of dating both Richard the Werewolf and Jean Claude the Vampire at the same time. I don't especially like an Anita who has sex with any male within reach. I hope Anita learns to control the ardeur soon, like before the next book comes out!Micah is only 245 pages of double spaced, large type text -- barely a short story for a vastly overpriced $6.99.Bottom line: an over priced, going-through-the-motions, not especially interesting story. Caveat emptor!I hope Danse Macbre is not similarly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my time and $$$ back!","review":"I was psyched at the prospect of 2 new novels in the Anita-verse this year, but after wasting my time and cash on Micah, I'm not so excited. This novel, or should I say \\"novella\\", is printed on low quality paper in a huge font with fluffy line spacing and blank pages(!) to make it seem like a much bigger book. I'm a slooooow reader and I got through this in about 3.5 hours. That's saying something and it isn't good.As to the quality of the writing, I'm extremely disappointed. That \\"thick\\" book covers only 36 hours of conscious plot time, Anita is whiny and weak, the 1 sex scene is pedestrian and boring, and the author doesn't maintain the lifestyle restrictions expounded ad nauseum in previous volumes. I've read better boilerplate period romance novels and that's saying something. I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novella not a novel","review":"The story is 245 pages, but they are double spaced and each chapter gets a blank page with it's number. Meaning it is really only about a 130 page novella. I read it in the store, and I'm glad I didn't buy it.The story is about Micah. Anita doesn't actually do anything but obsess and raise one zombie. You can skip two of the chapters which are just sex descriptions and not suffer. I really don't care how big Micah is, I wanted to see Anita kick some supernatural ass.She doesn't.Instead we figure out how her relationship with Micah works. End of story. Oddly, this would have been worth more stars if it had been from Micah's perspective and not Anita's. The story isn't about her at all, so why not give the character who it is really about the head time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually love Laurels books.. but this one failed in every way","review":"Okay... I'm not a Laurel or Anita basher. I love the Anita & Merry Gentry books overall... but, honestly, Micah is so short and so weak in plot and description that it really isn't worth the money even for avid fans. The sex isn't up to par... and kind of gross in a way. I won't be adding this to my collection at all... and will turn it into my local used book store! Uggh!Better yet, you can read it at all book store in a very short time. At the very least, take a few minutes to read the teaser for Danse Macabre at the end! It left us with a major cliffhanger that will force me to buy that book in hardback! I hope we have a new Merry book soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Curse you, Diana Gabaldon!","review":"I knew that I should not buy this book. The series has been getting worse and worse. I think that I actually did not buy the last one in this series.But I read the DG quote, and sure enough, my hand reached out and bought the book.What an awful excuse of a book. It is nothing more than a very poor short story. It is bulked out with improbable sex talk and rehashing of old details.I get it, I get it... Laurell Hamilton likes her men in short shorts and ankle-length hair. The sex-toy men in both of her series are amply lock-endowed. Her books have become self-indulgent to an absurd degree. Don't get me wrong -- I like a steamy scene as much as the next person, but LKH is not even pretending to have plots anymore. Her heroine in this book is boring and stupid.This book was so bad that I am actually going to toss it. I could not even finish it, as it became a grindingly unpleasant, pointless waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book was obviously some previously dropped chapters from one of her other books. Anything to make money and according to her fansite, I am in the majority. Therefore I will not be buying her next hardback. Bad enough that \\"Incubus\\" had no plot and boring sex. I recommend that the author re-read her first novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short but repetitive","review":"I started out loving the Anita Blake series; now I am quite frankly bored. As noted in previous reviews, the book is clearly much shorter than a \\"novel,\\" using cheap spacing tricks to make it appear bigger. Also, a plot that wasn't any better than an R-rated Lifetime movie would have been appreciated.However, I think the worst part about this is how the same things are happening over & over! Same sex, different well-hung man. Same background story, different shape shifter. Same stubborn streak (and getting more annoying with each book). Same zombie raising scene, different players.Also, her editor should help her find other phrases/words to use besides: \\"it was as if,\\" \\"kitty cat eyes,\\" boneless, scream, writhe, sheathed, etc. Zzzzzzz.....The only thing that makes this book worth reading is the preview of Danse Macabre. Laurell is too talented a writer to let her fans down with another MICAH again. I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Laurell K.?","review":"I've always been addicted to Laurell K. Hamilton books, my favorite being Narcissus in Chains, but this one was a real let down. It wasn't even that it was short, or printed in large, spaced type like a little kids book, it was honestly that there wasn't a story. It was horrible! A bad story that barely begun before it ended... what a waste of money. For all Hamilton fans, skip this one and hope for a better follow-up ... though I swear Anita Blake better not be pregnant in the next book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita, where are you?!","review":"This is honestly the lowest rating i've ever given one of Hamilton's novels! And deep inside me, it hurts.Once i skipped the emotional-melodrama of Doom, it took about 2 hours to read. I miss the Anita that was strong and independent, a little dysfunctional, but still a real-woman living in today (with vamps, wereanimals and the such) I started this series when i was in the 8th grade... all i remember is how cool Anita was, how strong, how smart and amazing. Now... she's a dud. If i met her on the street, i wouldnt give her a second glance.Only reason why im still reading and buying these books (aside from my obsessive book-buying)is that im addicted to the other characters. Jason, Asher, Micah, Jean-Claude, etc. Not just that they're so otherworldly sexy, but they've truly developed positively and realistically. Anita is falling short.Check this novel out from the library. It's too short and too crappy to bother buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a travesty","review":"I wish this was a joke, but it's not. This is a novella dressed up to look like a paperback novel. It formatted with decoractive headers and footers to take up more space, and a third of the book is actually a preview of an upcoming book.The \\"plot\\" exists only as an excuse to get Micah and Anita in a hotel room together. Hamilton's Anita Blake book have changed genre from modern horror/fantasy to softcore pornagraphy.I don't mind sex in books, but only if it doesn't get in the way of the plot. In the case of the later Anita Blake books, sex *is* the plot. That wouldn't be so bad, if Hamilton was any good at writing sex. But, her sex scenes are dry and disinteresting, and make me yawn. You find yourself turning pages trying to spot where the sex ends and the story continues. But, the way her most recent books are written there isn't really a story left once you remove the sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paging Anita Blake...","review":"I told myself that I wasn't going to buy this one after I finished Incubus Dreams. But I was weak.Now I'm done with LKH.This book is a joke. First off, it's short -- really, really short. Large type, double spacing, big margins: the publisher did pretty much everything they could to convince you there's really a novel here instead of a short story. Pity they charged me for a novel, too.Plot? Anita has to fill in at the last moment, and raises a zombie. Oh yes, Micah is huge, Anita has to feed the ardeur, Micah has issues, Anita has issues, and a slimy lawyer dies (that's my one star). That's it: we don't need no steenkin' plot.Anita was a wonderful character. A strong female with brains, guts, and determination. What a pity. Anita deserved so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother - even the sex wasn't that good","review":"I picked up this book hoping it would be a good story, but I was very disappointed.I have grown tired of LKH. Since she has discovered that she can write about sex, her novels have seem to be based around tawdry threesomes with very little substance elsewhere. I like sex, sex is wonderful, but come on now. Can I please have a good story to go with it? I am SO very tired of Anita over analyzing situations and of her pettiness. If this was also wearing on you as well from LKH's previous novels, then this will put you over the edge.With that in mind this book makes a great coaster for my coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have been a short story.","review":"This sucked. The only interesting stuff happened at the end of the book and even then it didn't last long because the main character got knocked out. I have to stop wasting my reading time on stuff like this. I keep reading her books because I'm holding out hope that one day she'll get back to writing good books like she used to. I did buy Micah but that was only because I got it for under $5. But I stopped buying her hardcover books a while back. Luckily I work at a library so I can torture myself reading her books for free. I think this might be the last one I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's bad","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews here. I was so excited to read another Hamilton book but \\"Micah\\" was sort of a waste of paper. While I enjoyed some of it, the story was so lacking in so many ways. The plot -- lame. The character relationship area -- weak. It seemed like part of the book was left out when it was printed. Don't buy it (I did!). Borrow from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A yawner","review":"Too much Anita, not enough Micah, after all we were supposed to find out more about him, hopefully so we could give a hoot about him. We already knew he had \\"kitty kat\\" eyes,a too passive demeanor, and a too huge member. Scant background on Micah, we learned very little we could use to flesh out his character. What did learn here, is Anita's IQ drops with sex, as she keeps using metaphysically challenged blood donors, and participants in her zombie raising, and expecting things to go well. It appears Laurell must be losing IQ points writing about sex, because she is either running out of ideas or getting lazy, as she has started a series of self-repeating loops on sex scenes, zombie raising, interactions with Richard,and after a while, it feels like a lot of \\"cut and paste.\\" We also learned Laurell is not above shamelessly milking a series, and watering down the milk. Boo000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have enjoyed all of Laurell K. Hamilton's books until now. I felt I was just reading to read. No new story line, no surprises, nada, zip, zilch. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Anita???","review":"I was also not impressed with this latest addition to the Blake series. I was expecting more. Most of the other reviewers have already covered the reasons why this book just doesn't cut it. I want to know what happened to Anita. Where is the kick-ass girl who didn't take anything from anyone? Why is she entangled in these messy relationships with all of these people? It's too much and too many relationships. It takes away from the basic concept: a tough girl holding her own against the underworld."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"I am a huge LKH fan but...this novella is insultingly bad. The publisher has obviously padded it out with widely spaced text, blank pages, and huge chapter headings in an attempt justify charging full book price for it. It is MUCH too short. There is even less plot than in the last few books, the character of Micah is peripheral to the plot and poorly developed. If LKH wasn't already well known, this would never have been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Hamilton should work all this out on the shrink's couch, and in the meantime we should spend our book money on somebody else. No excuse for anything she's written in this series since Obsidian Butterfly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler book until the next release","review":"I was really disappointed in this book, which I do think is just a filler until the release of her next work in June. This book is short with a lot of spacing. I read it in one sitting. I kept waiting for something to happen. There is usually a lot more action and plot to the Anita Blake books. This story could probably have been included in the next release, Danse Macabre, as 2-4 chapters with tie-ins to the plot. The best part of the book was probably the teaser at the end previewing Danse Macabre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton should be ashamed, but I'm sure she is laughing all the way to the bank. The book had lots of angst and little plot. The 10 paragraphs of true story could have been added to another book. I encourage looking for a cheap used version and saving your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother?","review":"This book is a teaser. I can forgive the author for writing a \\"novel\\" the size of a short story because most of her real novels are the size of three ordinary novels. I can't complain, therefore, that she doesn't give me my money's worth. The book tells us nothing new about Anita but does fill in some of Micah's background. The plot otherwise is thin. Anita is taking Larry's place at a zombie raising because his wife has some unexpected difficulties with her pregnancy. This main plot thread is speedily resolved, and the resolution has little to do with Micah, who the book is supposedly about. For those fans who just can't wait until Danse Macabre comes out, it's an appetizer before the main course, but I'm still not sure why she bothered."},{"rating":"1","title":"cost too much","review":"I feel that the the story itself might actually rate 3 stars, but I felt used and betrayed by the $8 cover price for a long-ish SHORT STORY!!!Laurell, your writing is getting repetitive. The sensual is being swamped out by the XXX porn movie approach. I do like reading the sex, but I'd really enjoy more story. You are on the verge of dropping off my \\"must purchase\\" list and onto my \\"I'll get it from the library and then maybe...\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM SOOO DISSAPOINTED!!! IT SUCKS","review":"Im a hUGE fan of the author, and when i read this book i was completly diassapointed. First, it was wayyyy too short, I dont know whether Hamilton felt stressed because her fans were waiting long for her to pusblish the new book, or if her imagination wasnt up for it, but either ways, the book was extremly short. When i finished reading it I was so surprise. Theres no twist, nothing that would make you wish the book wouldnt end. Also the sex scene wasnt such a big deal,so you will be dissapointed. Either ways, I think Hamilton is a great author, and lets just hope Dance Macabre is better and longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who REALLY Wrote This?","review":"I really wonder if Laurell K. Hamilton wrote this book. It's horrible! It's bad enough the series has gone down hill with the constant porn that just drags on and on, but this book doesn't even seem as if the same author has written it. Author insists that even though she has lost readers due to the porn she has gained others based on the fact that sales have increased. I think it's the same readers who keep buying her books in the hope that she returns to her original way of writing - only to be disappointed again - and again. Eventually the sales of the books will indeed show this to be true, since she doesn't seem to be interested in hearing what her fans are telling her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring...","review":"Why does this author have the rep as a good writer? Laughable dialogue, scenes as clunky as the platform boots of a 70's go-go girl, repetitive and incessant descriptions of clothing - give me a break.I bought Narcissus in Chains afterwards, thinking Micah was just a quick-buck-jerk-off, to find out NIC was almost as bad, just longer. I'm a voracious reader who will read cereal boxes, Flaubert and LeGuin with equal veracity...but I didn't finish NIC by a good 60 pages, which goes to show you just how bad the writing was.Gee, I wish I could find the really good erotic lit authors out there! Holly comes close, and I'll buy more of her books, but Laurell Hamilton is a waste of time (as well as money)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micah = Schmicah!","review":"Wow, I bought two books at the airport to get me thru a business trip flight and \\"Micah\\" scared me more than the plane trip. What a BAD book! Havent read Anita Blake in a long time and now I know why.There was very little cohesion in the story. Anita and Ms Hamilton's other heroine = are they now one and the same?? It was written like a book report. Large font, double space. I only read it because I paid airport prices for it. If I could have, I would have opened a window and given this book a free fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short to stand alone","review":"To me this was too short to stand alone, had it been a story in an anthology it would have probably gotten a higher rating, as it was a good short story that could be summed up as Phone Call--Air Plane Ride--Male 'Threatened' By Strong Female--Lengthy Sex Scene--Introduction of New Power--Interrogation--Zombie Rising--Fight--Hospital Scene. Anita's fears were also speckled throughout the story. We did learn more about Micah, how he became a wereleopard and how he felt about being part of Anita's harem .We also learned what happens when lycanthrope blood is used to raise a zombie and once again we are shown how Anita is different from the rest of the population. If you like to have copies of all books in a series or like to reread books I'd recommend waiting to find it on sale or buy it used, if not I'd recommend borrowing it from a friend or the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex, sex, and more sex","review":"\\"Micah\\" was a big disappointment to me. Unfortunately, in this book, Hamilton has proved that, yes, she can write straight porn! The story line is minimal and undeveloped. If sex is the reason you read the Anita Blake series, then go ahead-- you'll love it. I felt nothing but disgust(with myself-- I read it to the end looking for some redeeming feature. Alas.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasting Micah","review":"I disagree with one of the other reviewers that we didn't want to learn more about Micah. I was really hoping that we would see more of Micah than his werekitty persona and hair.Alas, this book uses Micah rather than discusses him. I really like most of the Anita Blake books, but this one is tedious; don't buy it; gosh, don't even borrow it from the library. Too much bad semi-porn, too much formula writing as though Ms Hamilton had left her computer on auto and returned a day later to mail off what the computer had prepared. Let's put it this way. I don't even remember the plot. Hmmm. maybe there wasn't one?Micah COULD be an exciting character, but the non-dimensional descriptions of his trauma and problems are not it. Let' hope the next book is back to the fun \\"trash\\" we've grown to love. Sorry, Ms Hamilton!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I would like to see more of Anita Blake, Vampire Executioner, and less of Anita Blake, femme fatale. There are way too many pages of detailed sex scenes from the last couple of books. Sex is absolutely part of Anita's make-up but I miss the hard-edged and saavy preternatural crime solver. I want more creepy stories, more spunk,and less details of her sex life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My 2 cents...","review":"This was the first Anita Blake novel I've read from author Laurell K. Hamilton. I've known of the Blake character...as well as Hamilton's other character Meredith Gentry...and Hamilton's other works like her 'Star Trek' novel and 'Strange Candy.' (Too, I like short novels).Many reviews have pretty much summed up what this short novel is: A lead up to the well-written sex scene between the heroine (Anita Blake) and her were-leopard (Micah) who has a very huge 'member'. However, the thin (or almost non-existent) plot is about Anita being asked to reanimate a witness to testify for a murder trial.Now, sex is great in a story when it doesn't overtake the plot, and here (and from what I understand of many of the recent Blake novels) the sex is forefront. I was asking myself while reading: 'Where are the obstacles?' 'Where is the conflict in this story?'Even good erotica has a strong story to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely My Last Book in the Series","review":"What a waste of time & money! This will definitely be the last book of this series for me - maybe even from Laurell Hamilton in general. I have not been happy with the last few but kept reading thinking perhaps it would get better & there would actually be a plot (or at least a different one)that would capture my interest again. Even the sex is predictable & somewhat boring - I found myself skipping over it just to see if there was anything else going on in the book. No such luck! I have never submitted a review before but felt compelled after yet another disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price of a full paperback!","review":"The title says it all... I feel that Laurell's fan base has been milked with this barely novella-length story. This nowhere-near-outstanding Anita Blake writing effort should have been included in an anthology, appropriate to the length as well as to the \\"relationship angst\\" theme of this piece (whereby another author's good piece would have made the purchase worthwhile). Too bad that my first book review disses an author I really like - but I truly feel that the marketers have shamelessly exploited my fan loyalty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free was still too much!","review":"The other reviews pretty much say it all.It's short - and no amount of fudging the margins, double-spacing the text, or adding blank pages instead of running the chapters together as was done in some of the larger novels such as Cruelean Sins can hide it. If it weren't for the sex being covered in gory detail I would have felt like I was reading a children's book!I got this book for free as part of Amazon's \\"4 for 3\\" special - and I STILL feel ripped off! That the publisher would still charge full price for a book which is effectively 1/3 of the size of Obsidian Butterfly is just a crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed In this Book","review":"I was very surprised to find that the book was really a novella made to look like a novel. The publisher used obvious \\"fill tactics\\" such as 1) the entire 1st chapter was in the previous book, 2) blank pages to add volume, 3) large print and double spaced lines. The plot was thin and was resolved most unsatisfactorily. Just when you wonder how the main character could possibly make it out of the situation alive - she passes out, wakes up in a hospital in good health with a new power.Up until this book, I was a big fan. This is the 13th book in the series. There is an expectation for a certain level of quality and consistency. Now, I feel like I was completley taken advantage of. Both the publisher and the author should be ashamed at this blatant attempt to make a quick buck at the expense of the fan. I will think twice before buying another book from this publisher and possibly this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring!Wheres the Vampire Huntress?","review":"FREAKIN' boring journal of an authers sex fantasy. No plot, no meat to the novel. Anita Blake has died a slow death. I am very dissapointed. Probobly won't be reading another unless i am so desperate that i have finished reading all the cereal boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulked Up Novella ... & Not A Good One","review":"Ms. Hamilton has always been a spotty writer. Some of her stuff is brilliant, some of it tepid. The serious issue with MICAH is that it isn't a novel.The actual page layout and filler content makes it painfully obvious Hamilton had to stretch this very incomplete and hollow story-- which removes Anita Blake with one of her lovers to Philadelphia in order to narrow the focus-- falls flat.Characters are introduced without further exploration, and the experimental feel of the piece makes gaping holes more noticable. We don't really feel any significant exploration of the relationship between Blake and Micah, nor do we ever really get any worthwhile plot regarding the brief \\"murder\\" trial it centers upon.The book feels like Hamilton did a character sketch, stretched it to a short story, and either conned her publisher (or was conned by them) to make a novel out of it.More Merry Gentry, please. Anita needs to retire... she is so clearly TIRED."},{"rating":"1","title":"No.","review":"The only saving grace of this book it that it could potentially set up reopening a future plot possibility that was closed in Cerulean Sins and Obsidian Butterfly.It was nice to see more of Micah, but this did not provide the character much more depth than we already had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down a wrong path to the looking glass","review":"If person does not know where he or she is going; any road will get them there. Micah is a short story that does not know where it is going and does not get there. Only Piers Anthony and L Ron Hubbard has left me this disappointed with a book.Hack writing is never acceptable. I feel like returning this wee book to the publisher for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fraction of the read of her typical books","review":"I don't know if the publisher was rushing Ms. Hamilton to get this book out by a certain deadline, but it looks that way. This book is a fraction of the size of her typical reads, 250 pages vs. close to 400. There's one \\"major\\" event that takes place and that's about it. I was highly disappointed. Folks are better off going to the library to get a copy as opposed to spending their $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and stagnent","review":"I agree with other reviewers. The book is too short and nothing happens. It only took me an hour or so to read. The price was not worth it. The book was nearly double spaced to flesh it out into a book length. I used to love Anita Blake. I now look forward to her books but it feels more like an obligation. The pre-view for the next full length book was a least interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I close my eyes, will it go away?","review":"(sigh) Laurell, what's happened to you? Is putting out a book a year draining you too much? There's no excuse for this.Micah is a novella dressed up to look like a full novel. The plotline is barely there, the characterizations are shallow, and everything just seems wooden & unlikable. The book is actually just as cheaply done as anything else, as the spacing is overdone in order to stretch out a 100-ish page novel out into 300-ish pages. If this had been published as a short story I wouldn't have minded the barely there plotline or dull characters. But as a novel, let alone as an actual numbered book in the series? That's unforgivable.I can only hope that eventually things will improve. As it is, this book contributed to why I no longer purchase her books anymore and why I no longer have read anything after this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A short story","review":"This is a short story packaged as a novel, the type is double spaced like a gradeschool kid's 10 page report. If you pay full price for it, you're gonna feel ripped off.This story has a short Anita Blake - Animator plot line fluffed out with the too common sex scene and a tiny bit of Micah's background.Nothing wrong with the story if you are an Anita Blake fan, but there's nothing exceptional about it either to justify what might be a 60k word story for the price of a 300k word story."},{"rating":"2","title":"short but good","review":"When I saw the book was 288 pages I thought it would be a bit more to it.The pages are not single spaced and this is more like a short story but it is the usual awesome LKH story.It reads more like a chapter out of one of her full length stories and released as a teaser for the book this summer.We finally learn a little more about MICAH but not enough.

He's ready to break away from his \\"pushover\\" image, and little by little, he's becoming more confident, strong, and...hard to be around.The book doesn't take enough time to make you feel like Brian's actually been taken for granted, I think. It pretty much gets straight to the part where Brian is sick of being pushed around. I also think Brian overreacted just a tad, but the book was still good! The lyrics to the songs Big Noise (Made up of Brian, Blue, Damon, and Salvador.) played were kind of cheesy, but Francine Pascal is an author, not a songwriter. This book was what got me back into Sweet Valley Junior High, and made me realize what I'd been missing.If you like The Babysitters' Club, Luna Bay, or the Mary-Kate and Ashley series, then I'm sure you'll enjoy Sweet Valley Junior High."},{"rating":"2","title":"what's the matter with kristin?","review":"i rate this book 5 stars because it sooo good about how brian gets sick of being nice and thinks that his friends, parents depends on him so much because they know brian would not get mad.so he writes a song called\\"too nice\\" because kristin blows him of because off for lacey and his cousin trent. there are also some parts i dont really like for example, what's kristin problem anyway? just because brians not talking to him it does not mean he would break up w/ her besides she's the one blowing brian off.and about sal and liz? sal is kind of stupid why can't he admit he still likes liz."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was Great ... find out why!!","review":"I think this book was pretty good.

I have not used it very much due to the limited kinds of foods you can bake on it. It works pretty good for pizza. The product description says not to bake high-fat foods on it because it will smoke & give off bad oders, so I've only baked pizza on it & reheated non-greasy foods. Evidentally over time it has absorbed something because the last time I used it, it smoked & gave off really bad oders. I had to air out my whole house.

The author has undoubtedly read the consultants handbook that recommends writing a book to extol the benefits of your practice and the author has done just that. The topic of competitive advantage takes a back seat to tales of glory of how the author has succeeded on the lecture circuit, with seminars and serving a broad range of clients. The stoties told are directed at agrandising the author rather than making relevant points about competitive advantage. This is a book for neophites to the competitive advantage arena who would be better advised to look elsewhere for a book on topic rather than one intended as shameless self promotion for the author.

Even though I haven't totally liked the last few studio outputs by IN due to their inclusion of a Children of Bodom guitarist, which made their material a bit more melodic, every single song played here destroys, whether it's from a recent album or from their mighty debut. We are treated to \\"classics\\" like \\"Goat Perversion\\", \\"Motorpenis\\", \\"Let's Fu****ng Die\\" and \\"The Lost Art of Goat Sacrificing\\". Mikka's possessed screams are right on target, and the bands turbo-injected punkified, grinding black metal works to almost near perfection. The production is raw yet clear.

It was clear from the author's account that they stalked the Crosby family for a period of time and despite that effort failed to gain any deep insights from Sidney or his family.

Still, I give it four stars because it was quite adequate down to 15 deg F (I never got to try it in any colder conditions) and the price was great. Also, it has a cloth interior which makes it quite comfortable to the skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy but confy","review":"I first tried this sleeping bag on a car camping trip to the ocean side last week-end.

It must be from the manufacturing process, so I gave it a month or so to air out. Still smells. Tried washing it, hangng it on the line, but that smell still lingers. It's really too bad, because the bag is well made and affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and roomy, but zipper could be improved","review":"For me this sleeping bag is warm, roomy and comfortable.

I have used this bag in conditions down to about 30F, and have been comfortable (not necessarily toasty). The construction of the inside and outside of the bag as well as the stuff sack is good and have held up thusfar with no problems.

I used the Teton Sports sleeping bag and found it to be toasty warm and awesome with its space. In the past I used a mummy bag, this is much more comfortable. Well worth the reasonable price. For storage when not in use I bought on Amazon a large duct cotton laundry bag with draw string closure. I don't have enough room to store the bag by hanging it up and storing it in its small compressible stuff sack is not good for the bag. The laundry bag is spacious enough to provide for roomy (but manageable) storage, it is about 2' wide by 3' long."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome addition to the \\"comfort\\" camper,","review":"Since it is made specifically for the cot, not much I can say is wrong with the product. I like the fact that there is a zippered pillow \\"pocket\\" that allows you to anchor the pillow cleanly under the fabric. Also, the small zippered pocket at the head of the pad is handy for putting glasses or a small flashlight. My only wish is that there were a way to put a fitted sheet on the pad and still easily attach to the cot frame. Unfortunately, the hooks that secure the pad to the cot tend to get in the way. A small point, but it would be a welcome improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great roomy sleeping bag!","review":"Great sleeping bag, warm and strong. Nice and roomy to move you feet and legs around. I really don't like mummy bags. Enough room I can roll over. My last bag, the zipper broke when I turned over, and that was a good Coleman XL bag...not cheap. The only thing I didn't like about this was that it does not completely unzip all the way around the bag. I like to open them up sometimes and sleep with one open on the bottom and one open on the top. I also like to open them up when I wash and dry them, which I can still do, but the zipper stops at the bottom corner and doesn't open flat. Other than that, it was great. Very warm.

It was plenty big enough for my 6' tall husband. He really loved all the room he had in it. There was even room in it for our 6 year old daughter to cozy up with him one cold morning! I can't testify as to the 0 degrees aspect, but it stayed nice and warm inside as the temps dipped to the high 30's. My husband had no issues getting it folded back up and into the stuff sack that it came in.

They describe experiences of modern day Japanese women - working women, mothers, sisters, aunts, lovers, ex-wives widows - in ways that should explode the vague stereotypes or incomplete images most Americans hold about the Japanese. The writing is direct and yet elegant in its spare prose. Not upbeat, by any means, but many of these stories will stay with you for quite awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Yet another delightful and beautiful Jan Brett book.

This product was perfect for keeping her warm through the cold winter months. Unfortunately, the zipper and quilting didn't last the entire season. Also, if you have a Maclaren, the JJ Cole toddler bundle me will be too large.

Although it is not as warm as the Original Bundle-Me, I personally love the weight & fabric and layer with a blanket underneath -- this way, the Bundle Me Lite can be used throughout the year. I also attached the Bundle Me to the back of my stroller with a few safety pins - this keeps it from slinding down and draging on the floor - works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slack Key at its finest","review":"This is beautiful and timeless music.

All ratings were positive, which is why I bought it. \\"Conjures up images of Hawaii\\" said many. Well, I thought I went to Hawaii, but maybe I was somewhere else. The music I heard in Hawaii was much more hula, waves, palm trees, pineapples, bury the pig in the sand kind of music. Perhaps the people who reviewed this know a lot more about real hawaiian music, and maybe this really is some good stuff. I jumped all over 3 major islands in Hawaii, and never heard anything like this.

Sviatoslav Richter traverses these intimate piano sonatas as one who understood the suffering of Franz Schubert during his final weeks.This is very stirring music, very emotional, but music which also serves an education. As one listens to these piano sonatas, as one inevitably reflects upon their content and their creator, one begins to think more and more about life, about purpose, and about beauty.Who wishes to end on D960?This is authentic music making, the articulation of an authentic human teaching.

I did everything I could to follow the instructions (don't let oil get onto the stone) that I now see are unrealistic. Try making pizza after pizza without a few \\"oops\\" of something oily.

The package was shipped in the original packaging, but Amazon should have cushioned it and then put it into another box seeing as how many people have gotten theirs in pieces. I asked Amazon for a replacement, which they sent right away, and that one was in even worse shape than the first (also with an undamaged package, indicating that the cushioning/packaging is totally insufficient for this product).

I now just set the oven for the required temperature and all is great. I already have many stains on the stone from use but it's no big deal.

The author (who claims not to be the subject of the book, but in fact is) is straightforward in the British stiff-upper-lipped tradition, but leaves enough on the table and between the lines for the mind to make ample work of. I really enjoyed it, and if you have even a passing interest in the meat grinders (the Somme, Paschedale, Hill 60, among many) of the western front and some of the further reaching implications of the war, this is definitely a must read, and can certainly be enjoyed by anyone.

Can't Marvel afford proofreaders, or is all their money going to publicize the Spider-Man movies? The contents page lists the reprint as \\"relettered,\\" leading me to wonder if the typos were faithfully copied from the original or were added in the relettering, or a mixture of both. Pages 32 and 33 alone contain 6 typos, leading to such enlightening exchanges as \\"It's Mr. Jameson. He has any appointment.\\" \\"My story will make you for a shoo-in for office.\\" \\"Yes, yes.

I am not sure why readers are complaining that their deaf loved ones do not understand the signs in the book; mine have understood perfectly.

What really got to me was the statements about how sign languages really don't have any grammatical rules. How clueless is this guy?!I ended up throwing this book out after looking through it once, and I suggest you do the same. Or better yet, don't buy it in the first place.

The whole book felt like that kind of writerly ignorance - the buffing up and bleeding out of your best and most revealing stories in order to make good copy. Even the honesty felt glossy and phony, and I can't help but think that many of them turn a blind eye to the real damage done. I was continually shocked by fact that so many \\"feminists\\" seemed to think the work of child-care is fundamentally insulting, but just fine for some other (read lesser) woman - or that between shaping the heart and mind of human being and launching a product in South America, clearly the one with more value is the one with a paycheck.

I had to put on hearing protection while using it.

The fit between the pump nozzle and the inflation stems of the toys (of varying shapes and sizes) was terrible and required me to pinch the juncture tightly during inflation to prevent significant air escape and disconnection. The biggest problem, however, was that the pump lacked adequate power to inflate the toys quickly. It took FOREVER to inflate even medium-sized toys.

Capetz is usually clear and easy to understand, and he seems to have a fairly impressive knowledge of key philosophical and theological thinkers in Christian history. He's definitely working from a specific theological viewpoint, and sometimes his interpretive efforts can get in the way (his interpretation of Luther and Julian of Norwich seems a little less orthodox than these two thinkers would admit).

The key is orienting the headset into the appropriate configuration. The in-ear piece should be turned 90 degrees so that it directly faces the over-the-ear piece (and not toward the ear) and the microphone boom should be pointing in the opposite direction of the charging end of the over-the-ear piece. Once done,the headset fits snugly into the case. The case is clearly designed for the headset once the headset is in the appropriate configuration and the headset needs no further restraint to be kept in place. So my only criticism is that there are no instructions on orienting the headset to make it fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOST MY HEADSET BECAUSE OF THIS CASE!!!!","review":"I was truly looking forward to this carrying case. The first time I wore it was at the local county fair. When I was driving home with my Girlfriend, I reached down to grab it and it had quietly fallen out without me realizing it! I did not even ride any of the amusement rides, I was merely casually walking around and it managed to fall out. I agree with the other reviewer that this product needs to have a elastic strap to hold it down. Now I am trying to find a new Bluetooth headset. Do not know if I am going to purchase a Plantronics 510 again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a useful product","review":"I just got this product. I generally really like the carrying case, because I like to clip it to my sun visor in my car. This case does not hold the headset securely and the clip appears to be on upside down and cockeyed. Logically, it appears to me that the open end of the clip should be pointing down away from the the open end of the case, however, my clip is pointing upward the same direction as the opening of the case and is slightly sideways. Also because the case has such a large opening and is not fitted to the headset, the headset juts out from the case which makes it impossible to clip to my visor and use the visor at the same time. This product is almost completely useless as far as adequately securing the headset and appears to be fairly worthless even as a belt clip due to the position of the clip on the back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its better than nothing","review":"I was looking for something to hold my Voyager in the car.

When they arrived, I opened one and tried to place the headset inside it. It does not fit well at all and you must fold it up to get it in at all. This means unfolding it again each time you want to use it - not a big deal but a time waster. In addition, the fit is so tight that it will only take a very short amount of time before the foam cover over the ear insert will abrade away. Very poor design. It appears to be a case that is not designed for this phone but just has a sticker put over the generic name to say that it's for the 510. Additionally, it's not really a case - it's just a holster. I returned both cases and would suggest anyone else not buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"This case needs a retaining strap!","review":"This is a cute little case, but doesn't hold the headset firmly. My Plantronics Voyager 510 headset popped right out into a plumbing fixture full of water! If the case had a retaining strap like some of the Motorola cases, that wouldn't have happened.If you use this case, fold the headset and put the microphone end in *first*.

It's simply too small for the headset!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I needed","review":"The headset fits into the case quite nicely, but it clips onto your belt. If you already have a cell phone clipped to your belt, you don't need your headset clipped there as well. You just end up looking ridiculous. I would have liked it better if it was a case that would protect the headset from being damaged while in your pocket. As you can tell, my gripe is more with the placement of the case than with its quality, which is rather decent. I just don't want to look like Batman with a utility belt."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews first","review":"This case does NOT carry the headset firmly at all. What's worse is that it can freely swivel around 360 degrees, and often ended up with the open side down, dropping the headset onto the ground. A couple of weeks ago, I took the dogs for a walk, and when I got home it was gone.If you absolutely must buy this one, I would at least recommend using a drop of superglue to prevent it from swiveling.

This is very bad design, at all times one part of the headset is exposed for damage. I don't see how I can give this more than 1 star, I would actually prefer to give it zero.If something is supposed to protect your investment, and at all times one part is unprotected, and you have to improvise on how to use it, or it might fall out of the holster, then what good is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I suppose if you just have to have a quick-draw \\"holster\\" for your headset, this will do. It has a short friction clip to hold it on your belt. But for my money, I thought it was a bit too loose on the draw.

Spring loaded plastic catches are always a formula for disaster, especially when you're dealing with an item that is bound to come under some sheer forces.

The medieval flavour is very strong and the characterizations are quite wonderful. The mystery itself is an easy one to figure out and the actual murder does not occur until the near the end of the book, but the plot leading up to this is very vivid and has the right atmosphere and sense of time and place. In this book we see Sister Frevisse at odds with the prioress in her convent. She must fight against her dislike and distrust of Dame Alys in order to be able to deal with the problems beseiging St. Frideswide's. Not only are Dame Alys' many relatives taxing the nunnery's provisions with their extended stay, but the relatives also bring danger to St. Frideswide's.

One could make an argument that the PBS bio was something of a hatchet job, focusing almost exclusively on Lee's most negative traits and offering little insight into the larger man. In contrast, the shorter A&E version attempts to provide the viewer with a broader, more balanced view of this highly controversial and fascinating American figure. If you're in the market for a good TV biography on Robert E. Lee, this is an excellent choice. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Real Laughs Here","review":"There are no real laughs found in this short piece (actual story time is 69 minutes).

Unless the sound techs, mixers, directors, editors and producers are all deaf. I do not care if this is the first time any of them actually had a job, you cannot hear what you cannot hear. Blaring horns and trumpets completely wipe out the narration. In one segment that have the narrator reading something, while at the same time some guy from Canada is reading the same thing.

Even on Netflix this series is unwatchable: The \\"background music\\" is significantly louder than the narrator, making it near impossible to decipher more than 25% of what he's saying. If you enjoy documentaries, you know how important narration is. This wouldn't be the end of the world if there were subtitles/closed captioning. Though it is advertised to include that, THIS SERIES IS NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED.

I believed the other reviews here and bought this, trusting that this was a good collection; what a mistake that was. All of the operas are recorded from 1970-1980, and the sound quality is HORRIBLE. Maybe I've just been spoiled by contemporary recordings, but this is pretty bad. I found myself snoozing through two of my favourite operas, Don Giovanni and The Magic Flute, which I absolutely LOVE. These recordings just aren't anywhere near up to par with others that are available. I haven't watched all of them yet (and I probably won't), but the performances I've seen thus far (Magic Flute, Don Giovanni, Seraglio, and Figaro) have all been mediocre at best.I guess all I'm trying to say is, don't be fooled by the good reviews, and buy this set at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest ever published!","review":"This is an outstanding book!

Manufacturer was awful, rude, and just couldn't believe his product wasn't up to standard. Tried to sell me a less powerful product as an exchange and promised that it would be better. I just wasn't willing to invest more time and money at that point, especially with a manufacturer that was so rude and condescending.

She was very close to my father and was devastated when he passed. But she does not associate this book with him and his passing.How crazy is it that some one swallowed an animal.

This is a great American folk song that kids love. Reading/Singing books with students is one step above just singing.

It keeps the teacher away from the piano so they can focus on voice production. But enough about THAT!

I thought it was so cute and hung it on our fridge. Soon after I noticed that my daughter was acting upset, when I asked her what was wrong she broke down sobbing about how the old lady dies in the end of the song. I haven't seen her this upset about anything in a long time. Even after I explained to her that it was just a story and not real she still was upset for the rest of the night. I know that death is a topic that we all need to discuss with our children, but I'm not sure that this is the appropriate way to deal with it. I have removed the craft that she made so she doesn't need to be reminded of it.

I bought this book intending to give it to my niece, but I loved Taback's art so much I had to buy her another copy. This story is bizarre, but so preferable to the anodyne junk they're sometimes fed with some mainstream stories. There's a song version of this somewhere, if anybody wants to do the hunting. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, clever, and entertaining","review":"Simms Taback's book \\"There Was An Old Lady Who Swallowed A Fly\\" is humorous, with laugh-out-loud illustrations of the woman who just can't control her eating habits. Taback's collage pictures include brightly colored paintings with snippets of newspapers and other interesting materials, and Taback incorporates clever die-cut holes which add to the visual hilarity. My husband said that the illustrations in this book looked like \\"Mary Engelbreit gone evil.\\"The poem is the old familiar American classic, but Taback adds some original elements by allowing the animal characters to comment on the poem as it goes along, all the way to the shocking conclusion. Children will enjoy the colorful pictures and the poem, and adults will enjoy Taback's wry sense of humor.This book was a Caldecott Honor book, but I think it deserved to win the Caldecott Medal.

The beads are made of very thin, light plastic tubing segments with interior diameters much larger than the rope (so they don't remain centered, giving it a zig-zaggy, disjointed appearance). It's also impossible to achieve higher jumping speeds.

I was pretty excited to have another pair since I used to \\"live in\\" SportHills. I placed my order, and wore these around after work for a few days- they seemed a little on the short side, but what the heck- I tossed the packaging. So I washed them on gentle with my cycling kits and put them on again this weekend. I took a closer look...one leg is a full inch shorter than the other. I couldn't believe it.

When not playing gross and cruel practical jokes on each other--which escalate into unadulterated viciousness--they plot to catch our feathered friends for their weekly Bird Pie. Complete with tiny birdie feet sticking out from the crust like so many skimpy crosses. Ugh...Well, anyway, their caged monekys increasingly resent being tortured in their topsy-turvy world, so with the aid of an exotic bird from their native Africa, the simian family seeks freedom and jungle justice for these pitiful excuses for human beings. The silly tale reads quickly--enhanced by the ridiculously skuzzy illustrations by Quentin Blake, who packs 75 sketches into 76 pages. It's such a revolting burlesque that it's almost funny. Offering no social redemption or character development, THE TWITS is a light read down the road of literary lunacy--cute withall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not eat and read this book at the same time!","review":"Oh YUK!

The Twits play their mean clever tricks on one another for the entire book and one is just a bit funnier than the next but what comes around goes around as you will find out. I read a negative review on this book and I disagree. You can't shelter your child from everything, and in some cases I believe it is not to the child's benefit to shelter them- instead I believe if they are raised with love and respect for others, they will really be able to enjoy this intelligently written, hilarious, not to be taken seriously, book.

Throughout the book they are trying to play pranks on each other. For example: at one point in the book Mrs. Twit is really steamed about Mr. Twit, so she decides to play a really mean trick on Mr. Twit. Whenever Mr. Twit would go downstairs to work on mechanical stuff, she would take his cane upstairs and add a tiny slice of wood to make him think he was shrinking. She continued this little sherade for just about a month. After just about a month Mr. Twit started to cry.

What a difference!","review":"I started on the Atkins diet program in September of 1999. I began loosing weight rapidly, but was frustrated by the fact that my 7 year old son was still gaining weight. I knew he had the same reactions to carbohydrated that I did. I wanted to put him on the program, but refused to do it on my own for fear I would hurt him. After discovering the book How to Feed your Kids Well, I started my son on the program. He lost 17 pounds rapidly, and we have maintained his weight loss for 4 months and still counting. He has the energy of two of his former selves. He rides his bike for hours without complaint, and is anxious to run and play for the first time ever. The best part is that he is no longer teased or called fat. He is happy. I know that this has changed our lives forever. I thank Dr. Pescatore for helping me help my child safely."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNREALISTIC AND UNCLEAR","review":"I was very disappointed with Feed Your Kids Well. This is an Atkins/Low Carbohydrate type diet that excludes most fruits and vegetables. The book is filled with list of \\"off limit\\" foods and only 6-7 time consuming recepies. All meals must be made from scratch and everyday children should be eating eggs for breakfas! What if your child does not like eggs? The author is unclear on what children should be eating. His suggestions seem unrealistic (especiall for working parents) and his exclusion of most fruits and vegetables seems more of a \\"fad diet\\" than a healty solution to a difficult problem many parents with little time face."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Whodunit","review":"Caroline Graham again hits the spot with this classic English whodunit. The book is set in the village of Forbes Abbot in fictional Midsomer county and has a great cast of characters all of which are fully developed in the first half of the book. The author sets a cracking pace and the book is spiced with a rather cruel line in wit.A first gruesome death, possibly accidental, followed by a definite murder brings Inspector Barnaby and Sergeant Troy into the mix and as the plot is unravelled it keeps you guessing right up until the end.This may not be Caroline Graham's very best but it is still a mighty good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Love Caroline Graham's style of writing and ability to weave a tale.

Although he makes an appearance in the middle of the book, this is not an \\"Inspector Barnaby\\" tale. It appears the author had an idea for a novel, but tried to ensure it's financial success by passing it off as an entry in this well-liked series.The majority of the characters are neither quaint nor eccentric, just warped and/or damaged.

I love Midsomer Murders and I thought this would be closely related, but the author just meandered through out, never pushing forward the plot - what there was of the plot.The ending was ridiculous and tacked on - I cant believe I finsihed reading 500 pages for such a disappoinment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant dark mystery mixed with knife-edged humor","review":"Kem Nunn shows originality and genius in this portrait of the dark side of Southern California, seen through the eyes of a door-to-door salesman, who gets tangled up with renegade bikers in the midst of a violent feud.

This book was the cheaper one so I bought it, but I was very disappointed with this book I should have bought the more expensive one.

Hey, you can only fit so much on a CD. These works are well crafted, though they seldom plumb any emotional depths. These are mostly salon pieces. The full original version of the Sonata is here. For those of you who loved the Piano Concerto and craved more of the same, you'll hear occasional flashes of the Concerto in these works. McLachlan brings a deft touch and bracing energy to the performance, which is entirely appropriate for the works. Indeed, his technique is perfect for interpreting early 20th century Soviet composers. Check out his other recordings of such composers.

My son loves the stories you read to help emphasize the verse. The stories are short but extremely well written. They also deal with many situations that children deal with. I always insert his name and one of his friend's names into the story. He is so amazed someone has written a story about him that he cannot help but listen. Also at the end of each story there are a few questions to ask about the story. I was surprised that my son was able to correctly answer most of the questions.

I bought it for us to read our 6 year old son for family devotion time. While he enjoys it, and we truly benefit from it, I wish we had discovered it when he was 4 yrs. old because it provides a very good basic foundation for learning verses. The Awana verses he is learning now are more advanced, but he still enjoys the stories that go along with the verses in this book. If you have a 4 year old, it is not too soon to start which we strongly recommend.I wanted to comment on the quality of this book - the layout, illustrations, format and paper stock are top quality, and this is a book you will want to use for several years.

The book gives great verses to be memorized for parents and children alike. And I love that the author has you recite the verses you have already done from previous days.

BUT, the play button is between the forward and the stop button. The play button is difficult to get at and they end up pressing the play and the forward button together. That messes up the tape. I don't know why they designed the buttons so poorly. The design of the buttons / controls is 1 star.

The shiny brass connectors are a big improvement over the original connector hose that had grown old and leaky over the years.It also served as an occasion to service the Craftsman reel which I had been intending to do but had successfully put off for several years. The o-ring should be lubricated to keep it from drying out and starting to leak. In light of the occasion I also put a new hose on the reel and now it looks and works as good as new.The hose was shipped in very adequate boxing and arrived in perfect condition.

The previous hose failed after just two months of light use (perhaps four times a week), springing massive leaks into two separate places and rendering the entire setup useless. Unfortunately, I didn't realize I had purchased another Suncast hose until I received the package from Amazon. I was hoping maybe my previous hose had just been a lemon and that the new one would perform much better. But sure enough, the new one had a nick in the side and some sort of wire (?) protruding from it. And sure enough, it leaked profusely -- so this one is going back, and I'll be replacing it with a different brand.

Anyone who has shopped for these things knows there do not seem to be many options out there, especially in the 10 foot range.

I'm sending it off in hopes this will be a one time repair, but given all the reports I've read elsewhere I'm not optimistic.It is very disappointing for a lens of this price (and picture quality), and sold to the level photographer it is. It still operates with manual focus but my clients are mostly families w/ young children... MF is NOT an option with these fast moving subjects.If it wasn't for the SDM I would give 5 stars for sure.

It is fast, sharp, and has an extremely rugged build. It is definitely a large, heavy lens compared to the DA 50-200MM, for example.

No one selling the CD seems to have sound bytes available to preview and no one seems to carry it (to hear in a store's listening station)! I do love her reserved, but powerful style in this very ecclectic collection of songs. She fits in to the female vocal puzzle somewhere between Connie Francis and Teresa Brewer in my opinion. Not quite as \\"crying\\" as Connie but soulful. The arrangements that accompany her vocals are top-notch and she often does very amusing, delightful takes on standards. Examples: \\"Sweetest Sounds\\" with its zesty \\"Bobby Vinton\\" - like polka beat; \\"Love me Baby\\" (very Teresa Brewer delivery); also how peppy her version of the classic \\"Havah Nagilah\\" is so full of joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britain's 60's blonde-bombshell who packs a punch","review":"Kathy has a terrific voice and fabulous good look, camparable with Marilyn Monroe.

This is one of the best games I've played in years. Like some other strategy games, you control a team with various abilities, and there are multiple solutions to many of the challenges. But in this one, you get to be Robin Hood! There's a path for those who like to kill and ways to win with almost no bloodshed. It has humor, drama, and spectacular scenery. There's a satisfying number of challenges but a widely varied range of difficulty settings. I can't say enough good things about this game. It's easier and more low-key than Starcraft or Diablo--two of my all-time favorites. And it's slightly less engrossing than Escape Velocity, the best game ever designed for the Mac. But the blend of story, intercut movies, voices, and game play is almost impossible to beat. I can't believe that \\"Dead or Alive,\\" this team's other game, isn't available for OS X.

My only complaint is that it makes a high pitched noise when it's running, not sure if that is just the one I bought or if this occurs with all Dysons.

You have to buy the other attachment, which really should be part of the package for a vacuum of this price. Otherwise, it is a well thought, well designed vacuum and it really sucked up everything that my other vacuum left behind. I could not believe how much the vacuum picked up after using it the first time.

Somethings are just lemons. It's been a few weeks, and it still works like new. Overall, it's lighter and quieter than our previous bagless vacuum. It's hard to quantify how much more this vacuum picks up than our last. Maybe a little more. The best feature is how easily it comes apart. My husband likes to take things apart and clean them properly. For example, the rotating brushes. The Dyson makes it easy. The only drawback to this model is the suction wand is cumbersome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum","review":"I love this vacuum it picks up great and is so easy to empty. You can place the canister way down in the basket so that dust doesn't go all over. I couldn't believe how much it picked up. It is very easy to maneuver also.Con- The tools are clumsy you have to have the hard wand attached, so if you are trying to do something under and around something it is impossible. I also think the (for lack of a better word) pedal that you push to put the vacuum in the vacuum mode (release it form upright position)is very flimsy and I could see that breaking.

The claim that it never clogs up, ever is bogus.

It makes a horrible screaming noise before I can get two rooms vacuumed, and the above process has to be repeated each time. I would never pay this much money for something as unreliable again.

I ordered 5 of these for our lab, and consider them almost unusable.Issues:* When lightly closed, both cutting edges are not completely parallel (you can see a sliver of light through the teeth on one side). This means that when you cut something, you have to push down harder to get a complete cut.* When you squeeze them with any amount of force (2 fingers + thumb), it goes cross-jawed. This is because the rivet is not tight, has slop in it. Since it's a rivet, you can't tighten it.So, in conclusion, if you want to do precision work, stay away from these. I'm not sure if it's just this product / batch, or whether this is a sign of poor QC at Xcelite.

This product worked great until the jaw broke. I will not buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits klean kanteen!","review":"I bought these to use for my klean kanteens that have the sippy adaptor and they fit perfectly. The only drawback is that they are very easy to lose. The sippy spouts used to get covered with dust, lint, etc., but with these caps that's no longer an issue. Sometimes I notice condensation inside so they do have to be cleaned regularly to prevent any mildew/mold from growing there. But overall they work great for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-purpose caps","review":"I use this not only for baby's bottle cap but to train baby to sip from a regular cup. I fill it halfway with water and have my 8 month old sip from it. She enjoys it, especially that its summer and hot, I give her cool water. She loves taking sips! Be careful and just let baby's lips barely touch the water as it could go into the wrong tube. I know when she's done when she lets the water spill out from her mouth, sort of playing with the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to have extra","review":"It really helps to have extra dome caps. I find when I run them through the dishwasher, inevitably at least one flips over and fills with dirty dishwater by the time the cycle is complete. If you have to rewash it, or if you simply misplace one, its great to have extra. Given that we always have lots of bottles in circulation, it pays to have a few extra.One trick to get them from flipping over in the dishwasher and collecting water is to place four of them together face down and pin them down by putting a bowl on the top of them to weigh them down. Do that and they'll always come out clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottle lids","review":"This was great for the price. I was given the bottles but they didn't have lids.

But when I watched my wife go through this one in two days, I gave it a try. It is a well told story that kept my interest as a man. Definately not too mushy and the guys weren't trashed.I give it a four, because I sense that some of the history was edited out.

Some ideas here and there are provocative and that is why I give this book just one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just another New Age tome","review":"I've read a lot of popular writing for the layman about quantum mechanics and the zero point field, and found this intelligent and interesting. I found the explanations of this difficult to conceptualize idea well done, and it gave a me a bit more of the quasi-mystical than I had bargained for, but it was actually a good thing as I tend toward the straight \\"scientific\\" explanations, and this author has a decidedly metaphysical bent.

She has made Quantum Physics Research and the resulting Earth shaking conclusions understandable and enjoyable for the layman.

It confirmed for me, another perspective, the \\"field\\", which I had previously heard about but hadn't seen any real data to quantify it. McTaggert shares stories of many scientists who through their own and others experiments have come to believe there is more out there than we can see. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an Easy Read, but a Great One","review":"This book is a great read for those who don't mind uber-complicated texts. It's not complicated in terms of mathmatics, but more in concept.

It put a lot of disentangled thoughts into coherent material for me. It shows a vision of a possible world of peace, harmony and knowledge that can enrichen our lives even better. What is lacking is it was a bit dry at times, and there were no visuals to support the text.

It is so slow, with chapter after chapter about some poor scientist that was discredited for his ideas, then years later, ONE other scientist had the same idea. Each experiment described had a conclusion different than the rest of the scientific community had for the same results.

I bought the book; what was I thinking? I've been in her shoes to a much less emboldened degree and it made me quite uncomfortable. I should have listened to instinct, especially when the cover of her book proclaims an earlier title: \\"The Lost Symbol.\\" That's just too much of the earth's crust to cover for one woman.I'm not going to cite objectionable passages; just keep in mind, the science McTaggart is dealing just doesn't seem solid by her translation.

A broad and thorough review of the current scientific literature shows McTaggart's conclusions to be greatly exaggerated at the least. As an advocate of rigorous and methodologically sound paranormal research, I find such sloppy \\"X-files journalism\\" a disservice to the valid invesigation of same. Rather, I reccomend Radin's The Concious Universe as a worthwhile alternative for the serious reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brings it all together","review":"I suggest prerequisite readings to anyone who really wants to get the most out of this extremely well written book. You need to understand the basics of quantum mechanics. For that, first read Gary Zukav's masterpiece \\"The Dancing Wu Li Masters\\" followed by Fritov Capra's \\"The Tao of Physics.\\" The latter covers the same basic principles but from a perspective that adds to overall understanding. Follow these with Amit Goswami's masterpiece, \\"Physics of the Soul.\\" All three books are written for laypeople. You really need to understand quantum physics for yourself to believe it's incredible implications which McTaggert discusses so well. On the other hand, if you read \\"The Field\\" with no understanding of QP, you might not appreciate how very \\"real\\" are the amazing things discussed in this book.

To listen to Arlo re-sing and remaster this classic album is a real treat. His voice has not changed one bit and he adds just a little bit of humour to the new version of Alice that stirs up a little giggle and makes you realise that if you can have a sense of humour about religion, or politics or yourself then the world is a better place. Anything that can make you smile in this day and age has won my vote. Arlo Guthrie has done the world of folk music proud over the years and is still going strong.

Many people know the true meaning of Christmas and this reminded me why that is so important. At first, I took one chapter a day but I wanted to finish a book this month. I found that it didn't matter how you read it as long as you took some quiet time to reflect on what was shown in the book.

To explain further....take a look at the book cover picture posted on Amazon's site. Do you see the grey background graphics of bicycles and the branding for HUBBUB?; well, that is the background that EVERY page in the book is printed on! Reading black that is printed over a busy and relatively dark watermarked background is a chore and, at least to me, extremely annoying.

I love Jane Austen novels, and usually like modern versions of the stories as well. I found this one disconcerting. Initially, my biggest complaint was how modern the contemporary actress looked in 19th century England. Her clothes and hairstyle were a bit out there even in today's society. Severe. I think they could have made the contrast of the two characters switching places without the odd clothes and hair styles. The next oddity was the story line completely changed, as I understand was the point. However, the changes was so drastic for a fan of Jane Austen's.

If you are a true lover of Jane Austen, and especially Pride & Prejudice, you will hate this. Everything beloved about the original story - the characters, the integrity, the manners/customs/standards of the time - has been crudely twisted or changed. And the outcome leaves the viewer feeling anything but satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can barely get through the first episode","review":"I've tried to watch this on several occasions, but end up writhing in agony and mortification over the whole sorry affair. There is a real imbalance over how strange the modern character is in the Austen world, and how she is perceived by the traditional characters. Certain things are remarked upon, others are glossed over, and some are entirely ignored. The dialogue is painful, and if you love Jane and Bingley, Lizzy and Darcy, the whole set up and scenario will just seem wrong.I think any Jane Austen fan may have wondered 'what if I were in that situation', but the fact of the matter is that what I watched seemed like a bad \\"Self-Insert\\" fanfiction. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad exscuse for a movie","review":"Lost in Austen is terrible! The main character was shallow and stupid! (spoiler alert!) This movie is a disgusting insult to Pride and Prejudice! The main character replaces Elizabeth, Charlotte ends up alone in Africa, Jane marrys COLINS then devorces so she can be with Bingly who ran off with Kitty, and Wickom is just a misunderstoood young man. Seriously, if you cherish the love between Darcy and Elizabeth don't waste you time with this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mini Series for Austen Fans","review":"I fell in love with Pride and Prejudice after first reading the book in college, and was happy to find the movie adaptations of the book well done. But outside of the original story I have been generally disappointed in adaptations and fan fiction. Despite trying a few books about the characters, I never made it past the first chapter due to poor writing or drastic liberties in the eras culture.That was until a friend forced me to watch this mini series with here. I was instantly in love again! The original characters stay similar to those in the book (with the exception of Whickham, but it works), and the new characters are funny and intriguing. Any fan of the book will find themselves staring wishing for a magic door to open in their house.For those that do not know the original story, I would suggest reading or watching the original first. Although the story would still be entertaining and enjoyable, a lot of the quality would be lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Watch!","review":"I really enjoyed watching this mini series. It makes me feel like I'm watching one of my fantasy romance novels brought to life. after my friend and i finished this we needed were craving more and spent the next week watching either old films adapted from books or movies where the character goes back in time. It was a great time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...but ...","review":"I love this movie but they seemed to have left out my favorite part where Miss Price sings the song \\" Down Town.\\"Other than that it was a great flick. Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real keeper movie!","review":"I don't buy a lot of movies because I don't re-watch them unless I really love them. And I've seen this one three or four times already. It's probably just a romantic comedy for the average viewer, but the Pride and Prejudice fan will be right there with Amanda in knowing who characters are on sight and what needs to be done to fix the mix-ups. If you can call up a mental image on demand of Colin Farrell walking out of the lake, you will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careless","review":"While I am well aware this book was listed used, it was also listed as like new, never used. The book I received was far from its description. The water damage which had warped the entire book was only the start. Whoever shipped and packaged the book had no consideration in doing so properly. When I removed it from the half opened package (from improper sealing) the first 70 or so pages were bent backwards, torn and the binding took a significant beating from cramming the book into the incorrect package. THANKS, I am glad I could send you honest and undamaged money; however you did not have the same consideration when sending the product! Again thank you for being so careless and taking my hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trekka Around the World Adventure in Sailing and Boatbuilding","review":"Essential reading for anyone interested in voyaging around the world or across the ocean seas.

However, we have purchased four additional of these handsets over that period of time, and virtually all of them are worth only discarding (two of them already have been).

But we don't use the game board at all; we have never thought it added to the game. The best part about charades is the acting not the board competition, so we just use the cards and sometimes the dice. Each card has 3 options/clues going from easiest to hardest. We'll stack up the cards; each person takes a turn picking the top card and acting out one of the clues. Sometimes we'll just pick one on the card we want to do or sometimes we'll roll the dice to determine it. The clues are typically animals and actions (e.g. brush your teeth). They are not movies or books like in other charades, so they don't get dated. It's too bad they don't make this game anymore; we found a used copy to give as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic Breakthrough","review":"This was an intimate and great read. I couldn't put the book down and that doesn't happen often at all for me with poetry books. Each poem took me further into the twisted psyche of the writer. When I first started reading the poems I must admit I didn't think much but than lines like \\"the best way/to feel your blood is to lie\\";\\" o, and then the blood will pound/discoteque-esqe\\" jumped out at me.

Scorpion King doesn't have an awful lot to do with scorpions and seems unconnected to the Mummy movies which followed the same family through their adventures -- this is more about the Rock running around fighting people. Also, did not like that they changed the female lead (not Rachel Weisz) in the 3rd Mummy movie (that film is not in this series, bought it separate).

With fresh batteries the mouse and transmitter have to be about 2 feet from each other, so you essentially have the transmitter cord strung to your work area instead of a mouse and keyboard strung across. What's the point of that? The \\"instructions\\" (which are a joke) say that as the batteries get weaker, the signal will as well. I'm sure that the mouse will be unusable in no time.

Half of the exercises weren't hard at all and the pauses between each set were a bit irritating.

The excellent storylines found in his previous work is nonexistant here in this duology. The characters are shake-and-bake \\"hobbits\\" with flat personalities. There is no realism in the characters, either. No personality conflicts, no passion, just a sugary goodness that is hard to believe. The badguys are always off-camera, except for the seemingly endless battle scenes that are boring because they are the same each time: the goodguys always lose troops, but never \\"key\\" goodguys, and the enemy is always *cleverly* outsmarted. The second book is bereft of plot, as well. Halfway through the book, the Silver Sword is mentioned in the hands of an unknown character, Galarun, who is promtly killed. This book went to the printer as a first draft, and I hope the quality of McKieran's future releases makes it over the bar instead of doing the limbo.

Read this and enjoy them even more.","review":"I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good movies. If you actually make/edit/shoot/write movies then, this book is an essential. I was really astounded at how deep the art of editing goes. Murch explains in depth how sound (and the absence of a sound track) can change the viewers reactions to key scenes, and how create the right mood. He also explains 'natural' edits when the audience 'blinks' along with the actor or actress - sorry you have to read it to get it. He's worked on some really big movies and his knowledge is incredible on and off topic. But it's not a how-to-book, it really flows like a conversation between friends.

This book reviews Walter Murch's professional life and along the way, provides a look at the history of film itself from the one-dimensional nature of its birth to the multi-dimensional layers of sight and sound available today. Murch has made scientific and visceral contributions to the medium, some of which are described in the book, bringing to even more life for the reader some of the best films of the ages.If you care about good films, if you are interested in learning the art of movie editing or soundscape creation, or if you love words and how they can be used to enlighten, I recommend this book of Conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midler-Clooney CD wonderful surprise","review":"On a fluke I recently purchased the Bette Midler sings The Rosemary Clooney Songbook CD, not knowing it was out there or that such a CD existed. So many artists are pushing their stuff on TV, too many times the really good ones are overlooked.Barry Manilow did a brilliant job on this CD--the arrangements are straight out of the past...and as you listen to the CD, although Midler never tries to mimick Clooney, your mind senses there is a symbiotic transfer that takes place. Most importantly, every title is well done and more than worth listening to. Rarely do I buy a CD where more than one or two selections wow me. Thank you Barry Manilow, and thank you Ms. Devine One.

The \\"Sisters\\" duet with Linda Ronstadt is fairly tepid--now that Liza Minnelli is back in shape, I'd like to see Bette team up with her for a duet and \\"Sisters\\" would have been a good choice.Aside from that, this is worth your money. It passes the test of improving with each listen. Best Bettes this time: a witty \\"Hey There\\", the amusing \\"Slow Boat\\" duet with Manilow, and rousing renditions of \\"Mambo Italiano\\" and \\"In The Cool, Cool, Cool Of The Evening.\\"Those looking for camp versions of the Clooney canon should forget it--this is a highly respectful tribute."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Divine Miss M is still Divine","review":"If you're a fan of Rosie and Bette like me, then you've simply got to have this CD.

It's one of the genuinely funny and yucky moments in this CAMPED OUT ALBUM of songs. Bette sounds like a spaced out country wanna-be singer.Warbling thru this set of songs, the one good thing is that it is a short album clocking in under 50 minutes. Grateful for that!Barbra Streisand or KD Lang should've been given the arduous task of \\"covering\\" Clooney's standards. At least then, it could have an air of class and respect.Bette, who's next?

Because, Clooney is a far better singer than Bette. Midler adds nothing special--it's just a campy album. ALSO, Bette's voice is declining and she is hard to listen to on this album at times. As usual, Bette sings silly to try to distract the listener from the truth: the \\"voice\\" is thin, nervous vibrato and no lung control. THE DIVINE MISS M. IS NO LONGER DIVINE.

I heard this album being played in a record store and had to pinch myself that it was actually a commercial release. Bette should stick to schtick and helping the environment. She should NEVER have pretended to be a \\"singer.\\" Can't she hear how bad it sounds on playback? Don't any of her producers even mention how flat she sings? It's lucky that Rosy Clooney isn't around to be subjected to this \\"tribute.\\" She would probably have been nice in the press and said it was wonderful, then privately told her friends how truly appalling Midler's singing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose Lips Sink Ships","review":"What is the deal with the Divine Ms. M. lip-syncing on the Barry Manilow Christmas show, and on Jay Leno? Since she was promoting this album, one would have thought that Bette would at least sing something live from it. Overall I thought the album was fine - Mambo Italiano and Cool Evening are upbeat tracks, and my favourite selections. It's sad to say, but like so many people that were once unique, her time has come and gone. In my opinion, she's lost her edge - probably due to her trip down the easy listening adult contempo swamp. The lack of struggle shows in her music - no edge, no suffering, no credibility. Just another nice rich Jewish girl who sold out for the gold. Maybe she should ask her fans for forgiveness and tell us it was just temporary brain damage. For godssake,Bette, sing it live unless of course you have something to hide."},{"rating":"2","title":"What CD did you hear?","review":"This has got to be one of my all time favorites. I can't believe the negative reviews this received from some people. For heaven sakes, LIGHTEN UP! The only thing I can agree on is that it could have been longer but 11 songs are better then none. I think she did a great job of giving the songs her style without entirely \\"channeling\\" Rosemary. Yes, Rosie did regret being cast as a \\"novelty\\" singer and rightly so but this did not mean that serious music buffs did not recognize her talent. Although most people would not say they are Barry Manilow fans they still know all the words to Copacobana and here he is at his best. Over-produced? You bet and that is a good thing. Ironic that this CD is nominated for a Grammy in the same catogory as Rosemary Clooney, the last concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette & Barry should do it again","review":"This is a great CD. The choices that they (it takes both the artist AND the producer to make it happen) made were sublime. Bette's in great voice and the arrangements really showcase her unique singing style. Bette is an entertainer and we don't have many of them left anymore and she proves why with this material! You can tell she feels this stuff and one can only hope that she tackles more of the genre as she's done in the past. She's simply too good.The only negative is the number of cuts on the CD. Technology today allows 80 minutes on a CD and it's a bit of a negative to have just over 30 minutes used. (I guess that's part of the reason I buy most of my CD's used and then often burn my own compilations to make the CD's that I want!) I did buy this one at full price and really am thrilled with it, but I just found myself wanting more!Buy this one for yourself and your friends. It'll put a smile on your face!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Wonderful!!","review":"Rosemary Clooney was more of my parent's era -but I grew to appreciate her over the last several years. Bette has always been one of my very favorites!! She does a absolutely wonderful job with Rosemary's songs - it is such a beautiful tribute.If you like Rosemary Clooney and you like Bette - buy this CD!You will be in heaven!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect! - but made it short!","review":"I got my cd in the mail just yesterday after ordering it from Amazon.ca at the beginning of September. Boy was I surprised to discover, when I popped it into my cd player, that the cd would last only 30:56sec!!But after the shock I was so pleased by what I heard! Bette's voice is simply perfect! Although I'm a true and convinced Bette Midler fan I don't understand why she couldn't have recorded at least an hour of material from all that the great Rosemary Clooney sang throughout her carrer???!!! Very satisfied by the cd -but hungry for more of Bette. Rocky Giroux."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Bette!","review":"I am a huge Bette Midler fan, and have been since the age of 7 when 'Wind Beneath my Wings' came out. I must say that this CD is simply amazing. It truly shows just how great Bette is! She can do the standards as well, if not better, than the original performers! And this is the truth here! Not to knock Rosemary Clooney, I am a huge fan of hers as well, but Barry Manilow's new arrangements and Bette's new vocal stylings have completely renewed my love for these classic songs! Congrats Bette!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and Sad","review":"I have just finished listening to Bette's new album--a Tribute to Rosemary Clooney. Well, I'm disappointed. Bette's no longer a great pop singer with her weak high notes. Linda Rondstadt does hold Bette up on thier duet, \\"Sisters\\". \\"Tenderley\\" is pretty good, but it makes me want to hear it by Clooney or Sinatra or Streisand instead.The rest of the music is just grey and so-so. It's always disappointing when an artist loses thier edge.I cannot recommend this album unless your an ABSOLUTE, DIE-HARD, HARD CORE, WILL BUY ANYTHING BETTE MIDLER FAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribute to Midler's EGO","review":"This is Midler's worst cd since, Some People's Lives\\". Bette is in love with FLUFFY mush and sentiment. Gone are the daring interpretations of the 70's and 80's. Now we have Bette, SLEEP WALKING her way thru pedestrian sylized numbers.What's next Bette? A TRIBUTE TO LAWRENCE WELK?And, please: Do vocal excercizes before your next turn at bat. Stop the warbling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Bother?","review":"Three years since her last album, more than two since her cancelled TV series, & she has no more energy than to record 31 minutes of a huge songbook like Clooney's? I have been one of Midler's most stubborn supporters, through thick (Some People's Lives) & thin (Mud Will be Flung Tonight), since 1972 (even before the release of The Divine Miss M!), so you have to know it breaks my heart to say this: I just can't justify a full list price release that barely gets going before the project is over. Of course, I should consider Manilow as producer: the last time he produced her (1973), the result was barely 35 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly pleasant, slightly dull","review":"Bette Midler's new album paying tribute to Rosemary Clooney is perfect background music, the kind of pleasant CD to have on while you're doing other things. You know the material, and you've heard it sung with more expression and life by many others. But it's harmless enough, breaking absolutely no ground, with no strong point of view one way or another. Certainly not a must have, and an unfortunate continuation of the suburbanizing of the Divine Ms. M."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland Bette","review":"Miss M. and Mr. Manilow may have adored Rosie, but this tribute is all strictly white bread. The only interesting cut is her take on THIS OL' HOUSE, while the rest ooze on down into EZ Listening sludge. A very respectful paean to Ms. Clooney, but Bette is definitely not pushing her chops enough to make this album interesting. And the arrangements are occasionally overdone on this short, ultimately unsatisfying disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one...","review":"This is an obvious scheme to get Bette rich off the world's mourning Clooney's death. This is the ultimate insult to any Clooney fan, or jazz fan! What's worst is Manilow(& linda Ronstdat) is on here(he took advantage of Siantra's death, and did the same thing cut a horrible tribute cd, even worst than this one). Midler has talant and a lovely voice however the arrangements are dated and make fun at clooney, Clooney would have appreciated a tribute album I'm sure by a tasteful jazz Quartet, by a singer like Margaret Whiting, or Keely Smith(however those gals are too classy they'd wait a few years). Midler sounds as though she were a 4th rate Annie Ross, she has the balls that Ross has, but not the class! Well in any case, this cd is not good, it's overproduced. She adds a techno dance club DJ mix beat to Clooney's worst hit Come On A My House(Clooney always regretted singing that). Pass on this and buy one of Clooney's Concord releases, get the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am a big fan of Bette's and raced out to get the CD this morning but this album was a big disappointment. It was one thing Bette usually never is - boring! She sounded like she was trying so hard to sound like Ms. Clooney that most of the songs just lacked all personality and life. Bette can be a lot of fun, but except for about two songs on the CD - not on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tribute or Insult?","review":"By the title of my reveiw, you certainly already know that I very much dislike this \\"tribute\\" album. Not that I was expecting reproductions of some of Clooney's biggest hits and some of my favorite songs, but the arrangements and Midler's raspy voice and poor stylistic interpretation left MUCH MUCH to be desired. The character of most of the songs on this album has been completely sucked out with \\"cheesy\\" adult-comtemporary harmonies and rhythms. This recording is an insult to the music and to my ears. Don't get it. Just get the real thing...a recording of Rosemary herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rose is Rosemary","review":"Having been a long time Rosie Clooney fan, I wondered after her death who would, rather, could do a true tribute to her. Barbra, Celine, Linda Ronstadt? Nah. Then along came the Rose with Barry to create a tribute that is so full of love and admiration. Miss Clooney was always known for her precise phrasing and balance and Midler nails it. Bette did her homework well and it especially shows in Tenderly and Hey There. It's sheer Rosemary Clooney and an astounding monument of her memory."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is everything bad about electronic music.","review":"This is really a tragic album of two legends faking it. Rinky-tink arrangements done on the cheap with a Casio keyboard and ProTools. How can an entire album from these great talents sound like the WORST wedding band in history? The music is a shallow and tinny as their intentions. It is immediate elevator music.You MUST sample before you buy to appreciate exactly how absolutely awful it is. I paid full price. Don't make the same mistake I did. I am a huge fan of Bette's better work, but I'll never listen to this crap again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss diva","review":"I just love Bette Midler, this CD has a lot of the hits. It is worth every penny of the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette Midler Still the Best","review":"I have always loved Bette Midler and her renditions of the old Rosemary Clooney favorites are awesome. She honors Rosemary by staying true to her songs but adds her own flair as well. Her collaboration with Barry Manilow was a real treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with Joan Crawford \\"Jon\\" reviewer","review":"When I first saw this album, I thought instantly that I wanted it. Thank goodness for the Amazon Music Sampler! Too much synthesizer - this would have sounded great and more true to the era with an actual orchestra. I'm disappointed and will not be purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short and not sweet enough","review":"Personally I am tired of being ripped by record companys. Yes, the music is great and Bette has seldom sounded better. But at 31 minutes this is a rip. Rosemary Clooney had a half century career and surely they could have added a few more songs to this CD. Don't know about you but I paid 'full price' and got half a CD. Too bad. And people wonder why music sales are down."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT I EXPECTED","review":"I was thinking along the lines of the daughter father duo of Nat King Cole and daughter. This was some what not up to what I was looking for. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette and Barry remember this is a tribute...","review":"A charming album. Bette and Barry have crafted a loving tribute to one of their favorite singers, the amazing Rosemary Clooney.Bette plays it straight - the Divine Miss M is not in sight, but that's appropriate because Clooney didn't need to showboat to show off her chops, either. Great arrangements create a stylish bed for Bette's vocals, which are better and more focused than they've been in years. Nice duet with Linda Ronstadt on \\"Sisters.\\" I agree that the CD is a little short, but that's showbiz - leave them wanting more! A fine effort from all concerned, and very respectful of Clooney's legacy, yet the artists involved allow their own personality to shine thru. A worthy addition to anyone's library of standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't GET enough from BETTE!","review":"I had this CD on my wish list from the time it was announced for release. I got it for a birthday present and played it at the party immediately upon ripping the package open. This CD is so short! Surely, Rosie made many more wonderful songs that Bette could have sung. This CD is 30 minutes long. There is not enough enjoyment to make it work the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boffo Bette...again!","review":"If you see a little red-headed girl (okay, I'm 50 but so what?) dancing along East 50th Street on her way to work every morning, its me and I've got Bette and her brilliant Rosemary Clooney songbook on my CD player. In a word, its genius. Clooney was genius as well and Bette seems to channel Rosemary's spirit through her own formidable instrument, resulting in this most excellent CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bette does Rosemary","review":"While I am a fan of Bette Midler, this CD didn't impress me. I did enjoy the duet with Barry Manilow."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought a Clooney cd, and Amazon recomended this..","review":"Boy were they wrong, I love Bette Midler, I thought she was terrific in Beaches, and sang beautiflly on For The Boys soundtrack. However thsi cd made me disrespect both Barry Manilow & Bette Midler, Midler's arrangements here are a joke, just listen to Come On A My House it's all techno, and Mambo italiano is such an insult to the Clooney family.Bette you should have made your arrangements more tactfull or jazzy, like Clooney would have liked it. Aslo you capitalized on her death, and recorede her biggest hits instead of her best songs like Your The Top, Our Love Is Here To Stay, No lone, No Nothin'... This was a sneaky scheme thought up by evil genious Barry Manilow(a modern day Mitch Miller, who wants to cheapen music).Don't be fooled, it sounds like a great concept, Midler singing Clooney, it just doesn't work, it's overproduced and way too commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ONE!","review":"Bette Midler's voice is incredibly HOARSE and she has problems with her PITCH on this CD. She's never been a great singer - only average at best - and this collection does nothing for her or for listeners.SUGGESTION: Buy RoseMary Clooney's Greatest Hits instead ortry Barbra Streisand's THE MOVIE ALBUM which is remarkably good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised and Let Down","review":"I am a Bette Midler fan and was expecting something special. Tribute to Clooney is faaaaaaarrrrrr from especially good. The songs are not incredibly orchestrated. And Bette doesn't do gorgeous interpretations of Clooney standards.The voice is fading and that's okay because Bette's aging (like all of us) but she did this as a \\"NOVELTY\\" and it just doesn't work very well.Barry Manilow, the grand wizard of Corny-ness doesn't help this album out. He just makes it's IRRELEVANCE all that much more apparent.Manilow and Midler together now is CAMPY NOSTAGLIA!The songs were done far better by Clooney. Bette should've explored how she could bring out the \\"freshness\\" of each song. She didn't do it.I'm a Midler fan who was disappointed and this cd will be up for sale very, very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"She's no Rosemary","review":"When will people recognize that Bette Midler can't carry a tune? Although her phrasing and enunciation are very reminiscent of Clooney, she sings these songs in far too high a key for them to have that whiskey and cigarette quality that Rosemary had.Save yourself the money and go buy the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!!","review":"How dare Bette Midler even attempt to put herself in the same category as the great Rosemary Clooney!This album continues to demonstrate Midler's inabilty to incorporate emotion in her performances. This material should evoke emotion in any performer, but Midler carries on the tradition of Barbra Steisand of being all \\"pipes.\\"Do yourself a favor and buy ANY Rosemary Clooney CD before buying this Junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're a Rosemary Fan - Don't Waste your money","review":"While Midler and Manilow are artists in their own right, they should stick to their own and not try to market a questionable product at the expense of Rosemary.No wonder Amazon does not provide a preview soundtrack of the album. Since Amazon won't refund after the CD's been heard, I used it for a Frisbee and it's history.The titles are the only thing that relates to Rosemary as the arrangements and vocals have no resemblance. Albeit one track, \\"SISTERS\\" I do consider a tribute and am thankful to Ronstadt for that.Midler does a great job. It's just in no way reminiscent of Rosie. I say stick with the real thing. No one can match Rosemary Clooney and I believe this CD is wrongfully capitalizing on Rosemary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This album makes you yearn....","review":"for the real ROSEMARY CLOONEY.

But, Bette's new renditions of Clooney classics is disappointing. And embarrassing. Bette Midler seems to have \\"hit the wall\\" artistically and creatively. Bette is no longer the singer she was and it's sad her hard-core fans can't be honest. Bette's renditions are lack-luster--Rosemary would be gracious but saddened by this new \\"effort\\".

It is well made and the rhodium plating looks really nice with the stone. The actual size of the pendant without the bale is about a half inch wide and three quarters of an inch tall. It is small, but it is the size stated in the product description. It arrived 2 days after I ordered it. However, I agree with the previous reviewer, the shipping charge is a huge rip off. It arrived in a little padded envelope and the pendant was in a small pouch. The chain is very thin, but I was not planning on using the chain it came with anyway.

What I found most interesting was his unique insight into senior management's stubborn outlook on change. It still boggles the mind that those in leadership positions cling so tightly to their positions - even as their companies start to fail. I think it makes a great case for a life-long learning process that focuses on keeping a fresh young mind.

I added it up and I have spent $26.00 on batteries in one month and realized that it was simply more cost efficient to buy a better mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chinese Jump Ropes","review":"I ordered 5 of these for my sons cub scout pack.

It gave me hope about being different than what society expects of you however, I found the conclusion of her story to be a little lacking of the depth that I am used to getting from Paulo Coelho.I thought the addition of hearing from some unexpected characters at the end was very good and thought provoking.I dove head first into this book and couldn't put it down but found I had to force myself to finish it when I felt the story begin to drag in what would normally be the climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzled Out","review":"This book started out well. I especially like how we find out about Athena from the various people in her life. However, about the time Athena found her voice, it seemed to turn into an Earth Godess sermon. The author lost me here. I did like the ending which I will not reveal. I listened to the Audio version of this book which was very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witch of Boringville...","review":"This is my first Paulo Coelho novel, although I always see The Alchemist and read about it on recommended reading lists. I have to admit I have found this one to be rather a snooze. I was certainly less than intrigued by the main character (The Witch, Athena, Hagia Sofia,etc ad nauseum). I understodd the author is trying to be esoteric here, and he seems very \\"deep\\" but I was bored! There was no real story, and I found his leaps and bounds from on setting to another confusing and unnecessary. I just didn't like this one, and I will often try to pick something up again later if I don't think I understood it the first time--but I just didn't like this one, at all. I'd say skip it. He seems to be trying very hard to be esoteric and spiritual, but he never really manages to make me believe one word..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cultural appropriation of gypsy culture","review":"A friend suggested I read this book about a gypsy woman because I am of Romani heritage. There is only one authentic gypsy experience described in the book, the annual caravan to Ste. Maries. Everything else is new age, wicca, and goddess. Nothing wrong with new age, wicca, and goddess -- just don't call them gypsy! By creating the impression that these are authentic Romani beliefs, the author engages in cultural appropriation, that is, stereotyping and misrepresenting a minority culture for profit, just like the plastic shamans who claim to teach Native American or Native Hawaiian traditions. I'm glad I got this from the library so that I did not support yet another example of cultural imperialism that also contributes to the general state of ignorance about Romani traditions and beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found myself in this character","review":"Sometimes I need an escape, sometimes I need to be enlightened, and sometimes I need to find myself in a character. I got all three of these things in this book. As an adult woman, I can identify on so many levels. The organization of the story is original and provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"A writer's gift dies by drowning in cliches","review":"I read The Alchemist years ago and liked it. Paulo Coelho is a mystic and in The Alchemist, mysticism has a proper place in the story. In contrast, in The Witch of Portobello, the characters and plot are mere skeletons whose sole purpose is to preach a kind of pagan mysticism (Coelho favored the Christian variety earlier, he seems to have switched). The characters for the most part speak in cliched phrases about love, being true to oneself, and finding a deeper meaning in life. Sadly, here Coelho uses his otherwise considerable writer's gift to make these cliches sound profound and new, mostly by restating them over and over in different turns of phrase. If you are a \\"follower\\" by nature and into paganism or New-agey spiritualism, you might like this book. Otherwise, you will wonder what happened to the Coelho you once enjoyed reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was He Smoking?","review":"Sorry, I'm as interested in spirituality as the next person but I'll take Eckhart Tolle's writings any day over this. I found the wandering Alchemist tedious and I couldn't even finish this book - it was so painful I finally gave up on page 222. Life is too short...The dialog was confusing - half the time I couldn't figure out who was talking. There was no plot to speak of. The characters were poorly defined (as evidenced by the dialog) and definitely less than compelling. The ultimate message (if there even was one), was couched in so much gobbledygook it was inaccessible. Gypsies, theater games, earth mothers, women peeling their clothes off in front of each other - all with no purpose that I could discern. Please! This is just plain bad writing.This book will appeal to those who found enlightenment in the Celestine Prophecy. Pseudo-spiritual junk. Do yourself a favor: if you want some truly worthwhile spirituality read the Dalai Lama."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much story, flat characters","review":"This book seemed like a sloppy drape for a sermon about mysticism. We spend the entirety of the book reading the impressions of the main character's acquaintences- yet these perspecitves are so alike that there is no transition in voice. It is a very crude way to move a story along that deals so heavily in character study; that all the ancillary characters be so painfully similar. It takes all the fun out of narrative in this perspecitve. The only coehlo- reminiscent writing comes in the form of short tutorials on spiritualism, and while the language is beautiful it reads like a primer and does not evoke the intended introspection. Boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Witch of Portobella","review":"I just could not gain interest in the main character. Half way through the book I just gave up.

I read 100 pages and set it down. It's not my kind of book because it's too \\"out there\\". I'm not likely to start trance dancing to find my inner self.

Sadly, either I a made an unfortunate choice in \\"The Witch of Portobello\\" or if this is a true representation of his talent,Mr. Coelho needs to seek out and attend a remedial writing course.His writing is simplistic at its best and pure drivel at its worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flash in the pan","review":"Coehlo came out firing with The Alchemist and By the River Piedra, however since then his writing has quickly slid. With redundant and dry prose, undergraduate philosophy and psychology, Coehlo uses his early successes to dupe readers into buying another \\"International Bestseller\\".

I am a great fan of his work. Thus, I was looking forward to reading the \\"witch...\\" However, was disappointed with the rehash of previous themes, and ultimately, with a novel that almost bored me to tears! There is little new or original in this work, and I would suggest that readers new to the work of coelho start with the alchemist, veronika decides to die, by the river piedra...etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genious!","review":"I believe this is the best book of Paolo Coelho! I bought it as a christmas present for my friend, but I managed to read it before I gave it to her. This book is outstanding and very fascinating. I'd recommend it to everyone, who likes stories with deep meaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"How a woman becomes a witch","review":"I would say that this book can be said to be a kind of fictional case study in the personality type and life experiences which would cause a woman to become a practicing Wiccan, or do some other kind of new age religion. Interesting look at what I would imagine is the personality profile of a modern day witch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paulo strikes again!","review":"THE WITCH OF PORTOBELLO is perhaps one of Paulo's most engrossing stories.

Although it was beautiful when finished, the pieces were so flimsy and thin that they broke easily. The \\"wood\\" siding is almost as thin as paper! Because of the poor quality of the wood, when I painted it, it warped and looks AWFUL! The trim on the house is also very poor quality partical board, so when I painted it, the wood looks rough and spongy. I have sanded it over and over but it is still rough. As if that is not bad enought, it is not possible to electrify the house because nothing can be nailed/pinned into the wood of the exterior or interior of the house. I would NOT recommend this doll house to anyone! Very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter the Great in duplicate!","review":"I agree with other reviews that Peter was an exceptional man and that the historical contents of the DVD has its merits. What potential customers need to be aware of is that this DVD is a copy of a chapter in volume II ofRussia - Land of the Tsars.

The \\"murdering wizard\\" is still romping free, and Kilisha doesn't get anywhere with her \\"boyfriend.\\" I mean, they should have kissed or declared each other's love, but there was almost nothing. IN the end of the book she just instantaniously thinks that she is \\"more than friends\\" with this guy.

I had purchased this same DVD at Target for $4.99 and was disappointed at that price. Knowing that I ended up paying an additional $15.00 for the same DVD was a blow.When it says unauthorized, it means it. The video quality was very poor. There were many inaccuracies in it as well relying heavily on biased media video clips. One of the worst statements in the video was in regard to the contract between Sony and Michael Jackson back in the early 2000's. It implied that Sony was disappointed with sales and terminated the contract. That is just not true. It was Michael Jackson who found a way to get out of the contract. When that announcement was made, Sony was no longer actively promoting the Invincible album.Do not buy this DVD. You will be disappointed. I actually am thinking about throwing both of them in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"MJ Thrown Together","review":"This DVD showed me that there are people who are only interested in making money off of the life of Michael Jackson. This DVD is only a collection of video footage of MJ put together very poorly. I was very bored watching the DVD and upset that those responsible with making the DVD would attempt to market such a terrible product to the public. I would advice true Michael Jackson fans to avoid purchasing this DVD.

What I learned was that there were many different types of women and what marked all of them was godliness, strength and kindness. Still, I struggled with the balance between modesty and just looking frumpy as what appealed to me in clothing sometimes seemed extreme to others. So for a few years, I rested in a tomb of taupe and gray, trying very hard to be quiet and good.Then I read DAUGHTERS OF THE KING.On each page almost, I had to pause and cry as God affirmed that although He had work to do in me, He'd made me the way I am for a reason. It takes all types of women to do the will of God. Unfortunately, sometimes we persecute each other because we are not secure in our own identity. This book does speak about fashion, but that's not all it's about. It's about discovering who you are...and remembering whose you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever Wonder Why You're UNIQUE?","review":"Dr. Gail Hayes shares in an amusing, engaging and refreshing way how various styles women enjoy in their dress, makeup and overall appearance indicate how a Harmonic Refined woman's tastes are different from the Chantilly Graceful, Creative Poetic or Jaunty Esprit, etc. Though each may seem peculiar to others, all women can revel in their own unique tastes.

It gives me a new view of life as we now have it compared to those days.One would never really understand what the people of Chicago faced during the growth of the city during the era discussed in this book.

And I'm very pleased with our 5 year old Coleman grill and the neat little Coleman LED flashlight that I just bought.So I'm thinking that this heater must have come from some other \\"Coleman.\\" Thing was put together so poorly that I had to take it apart and reassemble it before we could use it and, even with the fan feature, its heat output is marginal at best. I bought it to take the chill off one of our bathrooms on cool Florida mornings, and it does that - but just barely. I can't imagine it doing any good on a camping outing where the temps are freezing or below! Oh, and the handle design could be a lot better, too, IMO.

I checked with my local propane dealer and he said it would work fine using the extension hose that you can buy.

Some tips... run it for at least an hour to break it in with the fan running at least half that time. This will eleviate any odor problems. Second, enjoy it .... don't expect it to keep a full size tent or cabin warm in 20-30 degree weather. It is only adequate for a 2-3 person tent and only in 35-40 degree temps.

This is the worst (and last for me). Some dreadful (I mean 'really' dreadful) overacting from the two teachers which made me cringe.If they could only see their performances. A very weak storyline which was written on a postage stamp with room to spare. As the next in the series was filmed immediately after this film , one can only shudder at the possibility of having to endure another time waster. Most of the cast are okay but no serious acting is required from any of them.

It does the job that it need to do (going to the markets and the beach). The Croozer is well designed, easy to assemble and to use. Just added some extra battery operated light to increase my safety on the road. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My daily commute entails some off-road inclines and declines, which, frankly, I feared would topple the Croozer.

It works fairly well in this purpose. I have hauled pretty close to 100 pounds in it without much trouble. A few observations: (1) The bike surges more when the trailer is loaded, especially when climbing a hill - it can be disconcerting. (2) The axle mount for the trailer will rotate forward on your quick release due to the torque from the weight - I really had to crank the quick release down hard to counter this. (3) Bike handling is virtually unchanged when the trailer is unloaded, but quite different when loaded. All in all I really like this trailer. It could use some improvements like tie downs for bungie cords, and a straighter axles (the wheels toe out a little). If you want to park your car for days or weeks on end, and really feel good about hauling stuff with your bike, this trailer will make it happen.Happy Trails!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful item!","review":"This bike trailer is a marvel of engineering! All components are attached so they cannot be lost (except the tires and handle). The cart lies flat when unassembled and is easily assembled in minutes.

I put a lot of miles on the trailer and got perfect performance.

Mary Gove Nichols and her second husband Thomas Nichols seem so absolutely current. She was out there, giving lectures to women on their anatomy and physiology, teaching publicly about healthy sexuality and about equality in marriage. For people who just know about spa history from the novel and movie, Road to Wellville, this book will win your respect and even awe.And this book is a great read! It will spark up any women's studies, or 19th Century American studies, or history of medicine reading list. You'll pass this one along to your friends for a great summer read as well, especially if you are going to Upstate New York, or to Antioch and Yellow Springs. Her life was filled with adventures. This really does read like a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely, lively writing on a fascinating subject","review":"This book is that rarest of works--a wonderful read on an important, thought-provoking subject. As a biographer, Jean Silver-Isenstadt shows us how an individual life can reflect and reveal the ideas and ideals of a particular time and place, but she never reduces Mary Gove Nichols to a mere product of her era. Instead, the author deftly intertwines her subject's story with cogent and relvant insights into the history of health care and women's history, with the result that Mary Gove Nichols seems more--and not less--real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This book is what I would describe as an emotional rollercoaster.

I bought it primarily for Paul Rodgers but of course it didn't hurt to have David Gilmour and Joe Walsh. I was impressed by the very good guitar work of Hank & Ben Marvin and Phil Manzera each of which were unknown to me. Gary Moore was unbelievable and most spectacular gutarist on the DVD. Paul Rodger's versions of Alright Now (w/Brian May) and Can't Get Enough (w/Joe Walsh) were vocally comparable to the performances on Bad Company's Merchants of Cool DVD. However, while Paul again alowed the audience to sing the entire chorus from both songs these versions were better due to the backup singers joining the audience on the chorus. As an added bonus for me Paul Rodgers sings the lead on the All Star line-up finale, a nice jam of Stay with Me."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lineup of real talent","review":"Great looking/sounding concert featuring some major players in the history of the Stratocaster. Buddy Holly's band, the Crickets led by Sonny Curtis sing Buddy's hits and legendary British guitar instrumentalist, Hank Marvin shows why he's a legend(at least in Britain.) Paul Carrack and Mike Rutherford(Mike and the Mechanics) sound great. There's a lot of fine music here but why only one song from Gary Moore - the best guitarist in the show. And why on a program dedicated to the Fender Strat,does Jamie Cullum do a song without any guitar whatsoever? That seems odd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have watched this show twice on the television and I am surprised at how asleep the audience seems.

Albert is a capable guitarist in his own right,same with Andy Fairweather Low playing acoustic with basically Mike and the Mechanics?!? And Mike Rutherford...doesn't even play one lead lick! I mean seriously I could go on and on about this. There is hope when David Gilmour plays a brief set. Ronnie Wood and Joe Walsh are here. Brian May, although never and not a Strat man.

Save for The Crickets, Albert Lee and Hank Marvin who offer a descent performance this DVD stinks. The other performers are totaly unconvincing, they go through the motions and seem totaly bored and boring. The audience is unresponsive. If a guitar manufacturers want to advertise their product they should do it with their money not ours, because obviously this is what it is ; a boring 155 minutes commercial from a company who has long ago strayed from the original philosophy of its founder the great Leo Fender.

Gary Moore's rendition of Hendrix's \\"Red House\\". Played with feeling and a hard edge, he tore it up.

She must've been out of rehab for a few hours.One reviewer mentioned a 75th Anni?? Most of these guys will long be dead. Fender had their shot and this was the result. I can live with it.

I really could not stand how he always had to throw little comments at her to belittle her for every little thing she did.Anyway, after I got past that the book was pretty good. There was a lot of bouncing around from the present to the 1800's but it was pretty easy to follow.It's a story about a girl, Claire who is haunted by her past. She had an incredible night of passion with a man who she felt was the love of her life. This man was a person she could only assume as a ghost.

The pictures are of great quality, and the LCD screen is so clear and big! The only thing that is a bit hard is that the keys are tiny, which might be harder for people with large fingers. I strongly recomend you read the manual, because with my past cameras I missed out on features such as black and white pictures, and being able to crop the pictures ON THE CAMERA!To anyone who just wants a nice camera, but is worried about what to get, go with this camera and you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Price.

Five weeks after getting this replacement the exact same thing went wrong - the camera starts up, the lcd panel goes blank, the lens won't retract and the only way to turn it off is to remove the battery.

And the lines were still in the pictures when I transferred them to my computer. I searched online for a solution to the problem and found that several other users have had the exact same thing happen to them. A few of them also noted that after they sent it in to be fixed, the problem was gone, but then came back not long after.I could try to have it repaired, and I might, but I feel like the damage has already been done since this happened without warning and only about a dozen of my vacation pictures actually look like what they're supposed to.Stay away from this unreliable camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was afraid -- To stop reading!","review":"Somewhere, somehow Mr. Cooper wrote the perfect vampire novel.

A CD with a lot of quality content is included and it is too bad that some of those execptional images did not make it into the book as well. Certainly worth spending time on.

Their dinosaur toys are very durable (for rough play) and wonderfully detailed, properly educating the children playing with them what these fantastic creatures really looked like. Most of the older Carnegie models are in scale with each other, which is also helpful for teaching children relative size. I mention this because this particular long neck might seem a bit small in relation to the other toys in the Carnegie line, but Saltasaurus actually was rather modestly sized compared to other dinosaurs. If you want a truly huge sauropod (long neck) dinosaur, try the Carnegie Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, or Diplodocus.

However, the book grew on me over time. Marsden and Hoffman do a very good job of blending both theoretical and computational aspects of complex analysis. They do a very good job of motivating and explaining the proofs, and they do not leave out any details (this is both good and bad - it can distracting, but as long as you pay attention, you will never get lost). The illustrations in the text are for the most part illuminating and useful, and the worked examples at the end of each section are not bad as well.I did have a few minor problems, though. While many of the exercises are good, some of them seemed rather trivial. The chapter on conformal mapping could use some work. The binding on mine started to come apart by the end of the semester, although that may have been my fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Intro to Complex Analysis","review":"One problem some students had with the book was that it can get a bit too wordy with its explanations, making theorems/concepts more difficult to understand.

Examples at the end of each section are great and helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing effort","review":"although this book has lots of pictures (but not as many as you'd think, as some appear more than once), it has practically no content. it's very cute but not worth the 18 bucks. i wish someone would write a real history of catwoman, but this book is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I bought this lens shortly after buying my K10D, and I've been really impressed with it.

The subject of every picture I took on my K10D with this lens was out of focus when shot on auto. The focal point seemed to be 3m behind my subject. None of my other lens have this problem. My DA* 50~135 consistently hits focus on the target and is ridiculously crisp. I could manually focus on my subject and produce a reasonable image if the aperture was dialed down enough, but the point of this lens is the ultrasonic auto focus. At 50mm f2.8 everything was very soft. The image didn't start to sharpen up until f5.6. When shooting at 16mm nothing was sharp. The entire aperture range was blurry. At any range there was a 5mm purple fringe on any high contrast object. I have heard some people have gotten great copies of this lens. This wasn't one of them.

They have such a great return policy.As of 1/25/10 quality control problems for this lens have NOT been fixed. SDM failure is quite common.

Crystal clear sharpness, incredible colors, great bokeh, and wonderful contrast. For me it's the perfect walkaround lens--although I wouldn't mind getting my hands on a 31mm Limited!My copy does have very, very slight vignetting at 16mm at 2.8 but it's never been annoying, but it can be easily PP'd out if need be. I didn't mark it down for this because it is so slight and is actually pleasing to the eye, imo.One thing, however, is you should buy it from a reputable dealer with a good return policy so if you do get a bad one it won't be a hassle to return it. I have to say, though, that this lens is so good it's worth taking the risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the lens to buy","review":"Stellar! If you're buying a new camera, don't buy the \\"throw away\\" lens that comes with the camera for a hundred bucks (you get what you pay for), save the money and apply it towards this lens. If you have the camera body already and are looking for a top notch lens, this is it. The 16mm-50mm f2.8 is great for shooting indoors and outdoors. It is excellent in low light situations, especially where you don't want to use a flash. One of the best lenses I've seen in a long time. Well worth the price at full price through Pentax, Amazon has been giving this lens away, so even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Performer","review":"Excellent image quality across the entire zoom and aperture range that lives up to the DA* designation. The f/2.8 shutter speed provides for shooting in lower light conditions. Attached to the Pentax K20D, it results in very fast and very quiet focusing, and good color and sharpness characteristics. Only drawback is that this lens is a bit bulky (77 mm diameter opening)and heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product!","review":"I have been restoring antique motorcycles for many years and rusty gas tanks are a common problem.

I've read lots of stuff on stress etc. but this speaks clearly and movingly in a way that none of the other material I have read does. The author bases his guidance and analysis on spiritual teachings throughout the ages. He suggests that the best way of coping with stress is accepting life situations rather than fighting them. This is not about being passive, but about beginning with personal transformation rather than a manic attempt to change everything and everybody else.If you want a good handbook for coping with difficult life situations, this is an excellent recommendation.

Unfortunately, the script seems to have been a quick weekend job: A hastily assembled, ill fitting mess of standard scenes and situations which lead towards a so called surprise ending which can be expected from miles away. The only redeeming factor is the performance of Beverly d'Angelo - it's several notches above that of any actor in this movie (I mean, reliable and excellent charactor actor Richard Crenna is always good but he really doesn't seem to have put much heart into this matter). What amazed me is that even her dialog seems to be much better than that of the others.

Far better than the cheap peelers you'd get at the grocery store. The peeler is cast out of zinc and has a soft, rubberized coating on the grip. It is nicely weighted and shaped perfectly. The blade is also wickedly sharp; on par with a high-quality kitchen knife. I used it to peel some carrots and potatoes for a stew and it worked much quicker and with less fuss than my old peeler. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"maybe not","review":"I purchased a new peeler to put in a second area in the kitchen.

It's a nightmare and it's slowed down our project. Right now I am rewriting some code from this book that makes swing calls in a non-swing thread. This is a Swing 101 mistake. You might say \\"well, sure, but it's a hack\\", but there's no need for it. At all. I don't know how this happened because Chris Adamson is a really smart writer and great programmer. I've read some of his other books and used his other sample code and it's great.

The approach for construction of the simulation study for the same refinery process unit is given both in PRO II and Hysis.This book can easily compliment as \\"Basis of Design\\" in laying out the building blocks for most refinery process simulation studies.Experienced engineers can also find many tricks for their work.This book is highly recommended for all chemical engineers who can easily absorb the wealth of experience the author has translated here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refinery Process Modelling","review":"An excellent guide to better understand what's going on with the simulator modelling our unit.

The bright, gaudy colors, the bad humor, the nonsense, the poor dialogue. Even from an artistic viewpoint this entry seems more like a bad TV-movie compared with the more cinematic first two.The Pred has returned...again...to Gotham City and is once more chopping up bad guys. Batman villains pop in from time to time, do nothing, then disappear again. Other regular characters barely get a look-in or vague reference at best. Bats does virtually no detective work and Robin gets very little to do until the last act. It's all too fast, too familiar, and too shallow. Instead of giving us an epic battle between the two icons (as the title would imply) we just get a bunch of filler scenes and little else.They try to cover up their shortcomings with pathetic attempts at self-referential humor, but to the jaded (wise) reader it just doesn't work.Only buy to finish off your collection. It's certainly ain't no masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good use of form","review":"Writer Chuck Dixon has always been very adept at using the pre-existing characters of a comic book universe in clever, creative ways, and this book is no exception.

The Decet for winds, in particular, is elegant in form and full of beautiful melody and rich bittersweet harmony.

I have to say I like the other one a lot more.The information provided in this DVD isn't too bad, but too short for it's price. It follows a first time snowboarding student through her lessons. The first few chapters are really nice explaining how to choose your snowboard for the first time.But when it gets to the actual snowboarding technique, this is where it falls short. You get to hear what the teacher briefly and shortly teaches the student. Then it shows the teacher does it once, and shows the student does it onces. Repeat that for every technique.This can be a nice overview for first time snowboarder I guess. But still, with this amount of information, it's not worth the price.

Before my first season snowboarding I watched a different video that was very helpful. By comparison I was surprised at the lack of detail in Snowboard Skool. Snowboard Skool spends just a few seconds telling the viewer how to do something then shows one very short example of a rider performing the move.

At the same time, much of his music has moved into a chordal harmony.Some of the music is reconstructed by Kenneth Elliot; to my ear he has done an admirable job.I'll admit that being familar with Robert Carver will result only in a blank stare on the social circuit.

Instead this book gives anyone interested into learning more about both topics alot of holes in the story making it hard to completly understand H.H. Holmes and his murderous rage he left on Chicago.

After hearing a book talk about Stained Glass I was very excited to pick it up and read it. I soon realized that though the book was well written, it may be a better read for someone who is a bit younger than a junior in high school. The middle of the book tended to drag on a little more than what was necessary to compelete the novel. But I sitll managed to get caught up in the story of Charles and Ambriel. Charles goes to St. Bartholomew's church to skip his paino lessons. One day he hears a crash and finds that the church caretaker has accidentally broken a stained glass window. The broken window falls on a homeless girl and causes her to lose her memory. Charles cannot seem to shake this girl from his mind and ends up on a sojourn through his hometown of Caledon looking for clues to the homeless girl's past...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool for a touchy topic","review":"I've used this book teaching 10 classes in Multicultural Education for California State University at Hayward. It covers some \\"hot spots\\" like gender, special education, race, and social class. I've never had a student who expressed dislike for the book.

I believe that progressive ideas have done much damage to education in America. So needless to say, I wasn't looking forward to having to read this book for a CLAD course. To me, this book is very frustrating and one-sided, pushing a particular political agenda -- even though they don't say so. I found very little opposition research to show that the authors wanted to give teachers research from both sides when discussing tough, academic questions. Instead, the book is filled with self-fulfilling research that doesn't look at other possible causes for problems faced by today's educators. Maybe if those responsible for teaching the teachers would present both sides of the story and let the \\"educators\\" decide, then the teachers would be able to do the same with their students. But that is probably too much to ask of progressive minded people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left-wing junk","review":"I wish there was a way to give something zero stars.

This book takes every opportunity to try pointing out that all the troubles of the world are because of white people, and that all white people are bigots who want nothing more than to oppress the rest of the world.When the book isn't telling how evil white people are, it is making left-wing political statements.

It felt as if the authors had 2 chapters of concrete evidence and then took these 2 chapters and tried to expand them to fill an entire book. I felt as if I was having deja-vu throughout my entire reading of it. Some topics that I thought had been clarified again kept popping up and restasted the same idea in a couple pages worth.The author's need to take a course in which they don't use 6 different words to say the same thing. I read about a paragraph of information and the author's didn't clarify the idea, they kept giving me the run-around. For example: \\" This race can be an exciting, joyful, enthusiastic, jolly, joyous, blithful, peppy, perky, blessful, and gleeful bunch. \\" These author's really let you know that they used a Thesaurus, but after a couple hundred pages of reading sentences or paragraphs full of synonyms it really gets annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transparently Bogus Faux-Scholarship","review":"Banks is incapable of writing a coherent sentence or formulating a coherent argument.

I'll never forget the ear warmers with tassles on top for Oskan's mule. Hiliarious! I cried when loved ones died and the battles made me try to read faster just so I could see how they turned out. I did feel the ending felt a bit rushed, but that being the only downfall I had with the book couldn't give it a lesser rating. I can't wait to read the 2nd book in the series, I hope it's as good.

Show me that the character is struggling with the concept of Wolf-folk having compassion and feelings.

Written in 1999, and with so many new theoretical stuff on the gothic - some of which are incredibly sophisticated - this book just does not make the cut. if one wants a good introduction to gothic in general, one should try Fred Botting's Gothic, or more specifically, if one wishes to read more of the female/feminine gothic, Anne Williams's and Eugenia DeLamottes's books are super. the only worthwhile thing about this book is that the author expands the gothic \\"cannon\\" (although i dont like this word) to include some canadian writers who have not been regarded as gothicist before (thus the one extra star). but even so, the theorisation really really needs some serious updating. this book references a LOT, but i suspect that the author is merely padding her bibliography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing misprint mares otherwise useful screen","review":"Keepers playing Call of Cthulhu from behind a screen are doing it all wrong.

The \\"Call of Cthulhu Keeper's Screen\\" does the job just fine, and organizes the charts in a logical manner. The artwork on the front is not great, and could use improvement. It can be distracting to players.The main defect of this screen is the misprint where they did not add the numbers to the \\"Strength vs. Resistance\\" chart.

I disagree with those who believe that the documentary 'lost steam.' Naoki reappears almost at the end, showing his directionless existence in between worlds (the underworld and the mainstream society). The documentary portrays aspects of the contemporary Japanese society that are little known. It breaks stereotypes, and challenges the Western expectation of a linear progression of a film.

The book is well-written, often funny, and almost always entertaining. At times it reminds me of the book \\"Being There,\\" because Robert Rodriguez's rise to fame is so sudden, so unexpected, and so unusual.It's very cool, and may make you want to buy a cheap video camera, write a script, and start filming.

As a diehard Democrat, I always believed that those who were criticizing Clinton loudest for his adultery were actually committing the same acts themselves. This book proves they were! This book does not try to apologize for Clinton's cheating (which deserves commendation), rather it explains that these moral lapses are not uncommon in official Washington (or pretty much anywhere in America) and are definitely not the \\"high crimes and misdemeanors\\" necessary to impeach a president.

That the GOP knew back in the 1980s that Clinton would get elected President not once but twice. This of course was why they tried to make sure he'd win the nomination. Yeah, makes sense to me.2. That lying under oath is okay if you're a Democratic President. I guess it isn't REALLY lying if you don't know what the definition of \\"is\\" is.3. That Clinton is virgin clean.

I self-diagnosed it using running magazines and websites. I tried a Rubz ball, which helped, but it didn't solve the problem. So, I ordered this crazy looking sock. It totally worked! I wore it on both feet for periods up to 5hrs. I never wore it overnight. I probably wore it at least 8 times on each foot.

I purchased the regular size, not the large. At first I was concerned the size of the calf (up to 16\\") would be too large, but it's not, you can tighten it with the velcro. The problem comes with the length of the sock itself, it is so long that it goes over my knee (I have long legs for my height). If I put it below my knee and tighten it, then I had to adjust the velcro to the maximum it would stretch and it began pulling more on my toes than my foot itself. It looked and felt like I was wearing my fathers socks. I did wear it for the night, but in the morning my toes hurt a little. I'm disappointed, it looks like this product should work but I cannot recommend it for the average woman. I hope that down the road the manufacturer makes a smaller version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy!!

Don't waste your money as I did. I'm desperate to find something to treat my plantar fasciitis. I should have known from some of the reviews that this product is useless. In order for the strap to exert tension between toes and calf, the band around the calf must be so tight that within a half hour I can't bear the pain in the back of my leg. The velcro strap is only an inch or inch and a half wide so it creates a tourniquet around the calf. The sock itself is very long and the instructions to just \\"bunch the sock up in the middle of your calf\\" is ridiculous because then it slides down making the toe section six inches long! I'd never have ordered it in the first place but it was recommended by a physical therapist, even though she had not used it or known anyone who used it.

The strassberg sock did not fit me well. It cut off circulation to my lower leg and I had to stop using it. I cut the elastic on the top of the sock and it still cut off my circulation. I am not sure how it could fit people who are larger than I am. I do not have large calves. There needs to be a way to adjust the elastic and a sock to fit shorter people. It was also difficult for me to adjust to get the proper stretch in my foot. Although I had problems with the brace I got at my podiatrist's office, I wound up continuing to use that one.

This product isn't intended to stretch your plantar fascia, just to prevent the anti-stretch that happens when you point your toes. It makes my heel feel better in the morning than it would without the sock, and keeps me from undoing all the stretch from the previous day, but it also causes me to sleep less well, so I have to choose - heel pain, or waking up on the wrong side of the bed. I'd recommend it, just not for every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immediate improvement","review":"I purchased this sock at a local foot specialist. The first few mornings after using it I had a remarkable decrease in heel pain when getting out of bed in the morning. I seem to get the best stretch when I sleep with my legs completely straight, which isn't alway desirable. After a few days of using it the relief seem to plateau and I tried to pull my toes up further for a better stretch. That causes my toes to pull together which is uncomfortable during the night. It worked better for me than I thought it would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than boot","review":"I use it to stretch my Achilles while sleeping to help treat plantar fasciitis.

It pulls your toes up but not enough because it stretches out too long. And in the middle of the night, your toes go numb.

I do feel they help with the plantar fascitis pain. However, the stitching at the top of the sock near to where the velcro pull is located is coming apart.

It fits fine around my calf.I am only 5 feet tall, so I have to fold the sock over as per the instructions. SO just below my knee at the skinnier 14 inches the sock is unbearably tight. So much so that it digs into my skin, leaving a very tender impression for a while after I remove it. Also, it does not keep my foot at 90 a degree angle to my leg. In order to keep it even *close* to 90 I have to tighten the strap so much that it makes my big toe a little numb and painful over a few hours. So like a hard night splint, I'm non-compliant with wearing it (because it hurts, not because it's too bulky to put under sheets). I'm going to buy a hard splint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tight for 15 inch calf","review":"I ordered this sock to address plantar faciitis and made sure to measure my calf not once or twice but three times.

Prior to my purchase I checked reviews which were good. My calf is an average size. The sock is long, which needs to be pushed down so the velcro band is right below the knee (per the instructions). When the sock was first put on it held my foot in the proper position. I found that by morning, my foot was not being held forward. To me with the sock being so long, my foot movement during the night pulled the sock down and my foot was able to flex and not held forward they was it is supposed to help stretch the muscles. This did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midieval Torture Device","review":"I had high hopes for this device seeing as how it was recommended to my by an orthopedic physician, but I was sorely disappointed. I guess it would do the job if you can stand it. It puts a lot of pressure on the end of my toes and feels a lot like wearing shoes a size too small only worse I guess. I managed to get through the first night even though the tips of my toes were pretty sore by morning, but the second night the pain was just too much to bear. I wore it part of the night and gave up on it. I couldn't sleep and the pain was worsening. The tips of my toes stayed sore for several days. It didn't matter how much I loosened the strap; it still hurt. I tried again after a few weeks giving my toes time to heal in between with the same results. This device was a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I bought this looking for a magical cure for my accute PF from running. After a week of using I decided to purchase a reverse boot like support instead. I chose the boot instead because it doesn't cut off your circulation around/under your knee like this sock. The boot is low cut and holds the foot and ankle firmer. I was constantly waking up during the night readjusting this sock and tighting it back up. You have to position it just right to make it feel comfortable and I was constantely adjusting it through out the night. Would not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"More uncomfortable than the boot!","review":"I was eager to try this since it's marketed as a comfortable alternative to the boot. I'm very disappointed I paid so much for this. I couldn't wear it more than 10 minutes. My calf is smaller than the max size it says it fits, yet the material really dug into my calf and just felt tight and suffocating on my leg. Someone else said it's not for side sleepers (not sure why) and I'm a side sleeper too, so maybe I would have had issues with that if I had been able to wear it all night.My verdict: overpriced, extremely uncomfortable and very disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat helpful, but it hurts your toes","review":"It will keep your foot in a somewhat flexed position, but to get a strong flexed position you have to pull it very tight, which will cause a lot of pain in your toes.

My calf is less than 16\\" around, but I still felt like the sock was cutting off my circulation both at the band at the top of the calf and everywhere else. The strap is crazy. I felt like my foot was in a straight jacket. Each night that I tried a sock, after sleeping about 2 hours I awoke with the feeling that I had to get the sock off asap or I would die. Also, the seam at the toe where the strap is attached made the top of my big toe hurt a lot.
