Not only are they very thin, they are small. The cut out on each ear added to the decrease in size. I will not reorder this product. My former supplier provided very large, thick ears that my dogs greatly enjoyed. I have several rescued dogs of various sizes - these ears were gone in a matter of 3-5 minutes - my previous product from I-pets.com were of excellent quality, very large and of the proper thickness - 15-20 minutes or more before consumed.

One was spellbinding. The actors are awesome. This review process is great but too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlas Tried","review":"Making any kind of movie from Atlas Shrugged is a truly daunting project. The real problem here is that the written word, however impressive, does not translate well when spoken by actors. This is especially true on film where the characters are set free of the boundaries of print or the stage. Atlas is a philosophical statement surrounded by a story. The movie tries hard to portray the philosophy by quoting the characters.as written. It is a noble effort, but it really doesn't, work very well.The result is heavy and rather lifeless. Anyone who hasn't read the book is probably going to get lost in the story pretty early on. Better read the book instead.However don't give up on this project! Part 2 is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% pleased","review":"I've read all of Ayn Rand's books and essays, and had some doubts that a true telling of this complex story could be done well. Well, I couldn't have been more pleased. The actors were perfect in their roles. Taylor Schilling & Grant Bowling were the epitome of Dagney & Hank and seemed to have walked right out of Rand's book. I cannot wait until I see the parts two & three. As I write this, part two is showing in theatres and part three has a scheduled release date of July 4, 2014.A final note is that I don't agree with all aspects of Rand's philosophy, and I think that capatalism in it's purist form, as espoused by Rand, doesn't work in a world of finite resources. Not everything should have a price, e.g., the environment, wildlife, etc. My critique, however, is not on Rand's philosophy but on how well the book was rendered into a movie. In that regard, it exceeded my expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good movie","review":"Heard a lot about Ayn Rand, and read the book years ago.

Still a good movie and worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but doesn't live up to conservative hype","review":"It's better than \\"ok\\", or 3 starts, so I gave it a 4. If you only see this movie, all you see is an example of where are government could go. However, the missing people is too mysterious and confusing. The movie was made to work with part 2, which I didn't like that fact. I do want to see part 2 to see where it goes. Maybe in total it will be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Book was much Better","review":"The Book was way better. They tried to make a movie from an 800 plus page novel but I believe was short on money. Way too much was left out and the acting was too canned.

Disclaimer: Atlas Shrugged is, by far, my favorite book. Therefore, I encourage you to read the book first, but I will be satisfied if you are able to watch the movie. Indeed, the theme of Part I stays very true to the book's original message, so if you believe the gov't is too entangled in our personal lives, most of our elected officials are corrupt, and too many people rely on welfare, this book/movie is right up your alley.

'Atlas Shrugged' teaches powerful lessons that, unfortunately, have to be re-learned by every new generation. This production (Part I), although constrained by a relatively small budget, is admirably well done, and Taylor Schilling is superb in her role as the heroine (or villain, if you have a leftist/ progressive mindset). I am sure that A.F. Hayek would applaud this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I have never read Atlas Shrugged and only heard a little bit about Ayn Rand and her philosophy. I watched it more out of curiosity than anything else. I thought that it was a great movie that portrayed how the government seems to be run more and more. The movie went over several things that are happening more and more (not rewarding ability, the problems of unions, and public opinion that is not based on scientific fact), and it is rather disturbing. The acting was very good and I thought that it was well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid 4.","review":"I watched the movie. I was going to see the second, but bought the book last week instead. Read through most of the part that pertains to this movie thus far. STarting again in a few minutes.I was pretty happy with how the plot was followed. There are differences, of course. I thought the main characters worked well with the way the book portrayed them and the timeframe adaption with present day. I am glad the movie didn't have the history aspect of the characters. I felt the book over-emohasizes the the characters 'intelligence,' I personally thought it gets a bit old. I agree with a few other reviews in that the random 'Who is John Galt' disappearances should have been omitted from the movie, the name mentioned as it was in the book would have suited it just fine.My favorite negative review: That the book should be a series of 1 hour episodes by chapter. ---Why, you ask? This probably hasn't happened to any book ever written. Excluding Where the Wild Things Are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged today","review":"I have never read the book or saw the movie in the theaters yet I found this movie to be exceptional yet hauntingly eerie of what the future will hold if things aren't changed.

Anyway, I loved the story, loved the interpretation, would have loved if there had been more, and loved the actors. Since I have to bide my time until Part II comes out I will probably read the book so I can maximize my enjoyment. Lastly, I would love for someone to have given me the bracelet Rearden made (a token of his inventiveness) as a present and when I saw the Galt Line - I had to say \\"yeah, baby - that's what I'm talking about!\\" Anyway, if anybody that can make it happen is listening, waiting on Part II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Part I to Atlas Shrugged is good.

The book is terribly long so I was curious how theywould do the film. Producing more than 1 installment was necessary. The actors were very well cast, in myopinion.

I hope the book is better as the movie is awful. The acting is stiff and the characters are one dimensional. The premise is detached from reality. Leaders of a metal company and railroad congratulate themselves for building a railway line. \\"We did it\\" they exclaim, yet the movie never once shows any real work being done. Apparently the rail line gets built because the CEOs say \\"they\\" are going to do it and it magically gets done. The government is depicted as being against the protagonists and for other vested business interests, but these other interests are only abstractions of lazy asses. They never get fleshed out in any meaningful way. It is an amazingly shallow and ridiculous movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Failure....disk fails early in Chapter 12.

The amateurish acting combined with Rand's stilted and hollow language is unbearable to watch. I should not be surprised that there is no real emotion, considering Rand's inhuman philosophy. Unrestrained greed defines our current dilemma, Rand offers no solutions to the statist oligarchs running our economy and government any more than the social engineering apologists who have bankrupted our nation. That being said, this movie explains none of Rand's concepts nor does it enlighten anyone about human nature. Objectivism is faux intellectualism which barely disguises a reactionary philosophy that has no more value than the Marxist Dialectic that it opposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a mistake","review":"I shouldnt have bothered but I chose to watch this turkey.

Obviously there is no way such a novel could be recreated in movie form, but this film went the extra mile to be just terrible. The casting was a joke, as none of the characters represented even an inkling of what you would expect of them, and the acting itself was severely sub-par to say the least. I would expect that even among those that have not read the book, the movie is a let down. I try to find positives in this movie but find none, perhaps the cast should have read the book before trying to act it.

I consider it not only a great novel, but also a philosophy, psychology and political science book all in one. That being said - it is difficult to put all of that into a movie without making it over 4 hour long, even though it only covers less than half of the book. Had I not read the book, I would not have understood what was all going on in the movie. My husband, who did not read the book, did not quite catch on to the plot of the movie; I had to fill it in for him. The actors who portrayed Hank, Dagney and James were mediocre, at best; they did not give their characters any depth. Perhaps this book would be better as a 10 - 15 part movie series where the characters can be more fully developed as well as more details of the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!","review":"First movie to come out in a long time worth watching. So tired of films that have a great premise or idea to start with then invariably choose the low road, Atlas Shrugged follows its original trajectory.

If you are bored with knowing the rest of a movie after the first five minutes check out Atlas Shrugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged Part I","review":"Enjoyed the DVD from beginning to end.

I went into this film with zero expectation of being satisfied; and was completely caught off guard by the relative quality and care which obviously went into the making of this film!\\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was Rand's magnum opus; her perfect blend of philosophical writing and romantic realism. I never anticipated that it would translate well into film, or that a filmmaker who undertook it would respect the thematic elements necessary to the development of the storyline. Thankfully, the screenwriters and director seem most familiar with Rand's novel and do their utmost to make sure the translation to celluloid is accurate; while making it entertaining.I highly recommend that you purchase this film and show it to anybody that you can get to sit down and watch it with you...perhaps you could introduce them to her written works as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this today?","review":"I had read the book and also saw Atlas Shrugged Part 2 the acting was good in 2 so I wanted to invest in 1.

When people read great books, the casting of characters can be tricky. The casting person for this movie was spot on.

The acting may not get any Academy Awards (more due to the Academy idealogue than to the actor's performances) but it is fairly believable. The production sets used to depict this story also get high marks for a film not on a mega-million dollar budget. Some required condensation/editing may omit some background details given in the epic book making it a bit harder to connect the dots within the story. This is to be expected, keeping the film moving and within time and production constraints. Since this is the first part of a trilogy, 2 more movies will follow (part II due out in Oct 2012. then part III perhaps a year later), all 3 should be viewed a whole to determine continuity and final overall impression. So far, I am impressed and look forward to the next two releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never as good as the book","review":"I read the book and I know it is difficult to make a film as good as the book.

First off, the book is set in the 1930's or so - and the movie is modern times - which I hated right off the bat. It also misses so much in the book that I don't believe a person who has not read the book, could really \\"get\\" the movie. It seems disjointed. Acting is fine, the scenese are fine, but does not touch the brilliance of the book. I commend the director for taking on a feat like this, but it makes me sad to think that some may watch the movie rather than read the book and wonder what all the fuss is about with the book. In my opinion, read the book! Then, if you can't stop yourself, watch the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"Not as good as the book.(Of course)Some scenes skiped parts in the book that I would've put in for sure. I may have pouted slightly. As part 1 of 3, this movie could've smoothly been another half-hour. Passionate acting, great camera angles, superb acting during still camera dialog(which is most of the film and crucial to give justice to the book)...make an engrossing movie that's easy to watch. Only very rarely- for me, was it over-exaggerated, a kind of extreme,(sometimes even mis-interpretation of Ayn Rand I sometimes sense in those who follow her. Find actual interviews of her if you're a fan, they are awesome, and shows more of her intimate soul, a softness you don't get to see in her Objective, Philosophical books;) Aaahh...I finally have a trilogy that I can hardly wait for. P.S. Ayn w/Tom Snyder-w/Mike Wallace-/Phil Donahue, all bootleg, so far.

I also was not aware that the movie only covered part of the book which disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoud have stayed with original","review":"The concepts are still the same, but this isn't the type of book that can be made into a two part movie. There is so much that happens and it's because of a culmination of events that can't be accurately portrayed in such a short amount of time. Also, the way they've modernized the story and under-developed the characters really takes away from it. Now people will say that \\"you can't get that same feeling with a movie that you do from a book\\", but I disagree. Peter Jackson proved that theory wrong with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, capturing the essence of Tolkein's story wery well. And frankly, if you go into it knowing that you're going to fall short, don't bother with it.If you've read the book you know what this story can make you feel and this portrayal simply falls short. Hoping for a better result from the second part, but not optimistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely","review":"I've never seen a Movie that was as good as the book that it was made from and such is the case with Atlas Shrugged part 1.Yet it is undeniable that this is a very timely release.If one is willing and able; the parallel between the setting of Atlas Shrugged and the attitudes of today are unmistakable.The message and movie are well worth taking in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one good thing to say about it","review":"I have only one good thing to say about this movie.

It's obvious the director didn't attend a full semester of film school; the blocking, framing, acting, and pacing is very amateurish, and that's being generous as it implies that he may improve with time. I highly doubt that, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"While I don't agree with Rand's political philosophy, I can put aside my own bias to enjoy a good story. This movie is just poor. Its low-rent take on the material is sad. Roger Ebert famously said what makes a movie successful or not isn't WHAT subject the movie is about, but HOW it is about it.

In many cases good intentions harms for more than it helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really really really good","review":"I was so excited to finally see Atlas Shrugged \\"on demand\\" on t.v. today. I've been waiting to see it for ages. I didn't expect it to be good. I didn't like the looks of any of the actors when I've seen the trailers in the past year; they didn't fit my conception of them. The acting seemed stiff and the scenes cheap. But boy was I surprised. It is an excellent film and I LOVE it and I am very much wanting to see Part 2! The actors grew on me rather soon into the film. The acting really is good, the scenery lush, and the special effects pretty good. Some details are left out that are in the book, one that I thought was important, and that is the two guys talking in the basement cafeteria occassionally, and I wanted Dagney to sift thru a big pile of broken glass and papers for the engine, but all in all it is a great movie and I highly recommend it. Please please please, let there be a Part 2!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Atlas Shrugged: Part One","review":"What Ayn Rand wrote so many years ago was a book that stayed with me to this day. Now, since we are so close to 2016 as the movie shows, she was SO right as to what would happen in our country. We are slowly going down and so many of our rights are in jeopardy. I can hardly wait to see Part Two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This is a great movie, I cannot wait until it gets to Alaska! I have seen critiques due to no super special effects, little known actors etc. It is not an action movie, so does not need a lot of special effects, but it could have been a little better in effects. I have wanted to read the book for a long time but don't have the time, it being 1100 pages or so. I think the segments will be fine. Looking forward to seeing the next two. Very timely and relevant to current world situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the book","review":"If you liked the book you'll like the movie. Especially now this is relevant. Our government and about half of the citizens do not see the value of corporations in our society. Government cannot be the job creators as we've witnessed in the former Soviet Union. We must learn to value business and business owners as the basic foundation of our free enterprise system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ayn Rand fans won't be disappointed.","review":"Despite a low budget by current standards, this motion picture doesn't show its austerity and will keep you engrossed enough that you won't be heading to the kitchen for a popcorn refill until it's over. The cast of mostly unknowns did a fine and convincing job, and much of the dialogue was a direct lift from the book. Well worth adding to your personal library of must-have cinema art.Oh, and show this movie to your liberal friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Books made into movies","review":"For a book that has been adapted to a movie Atlas Shrugged part 1 was good. Those who have read the book will find the storyline very rushed and the charachters underdeveloped. However, one cannot normally develop a character in a movie quite like you can in a book. I enjoyed how they made all of the \\"villans\\" look, that part I think they really nailed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Film","review":"I originally purchased this because the back of the DVD cover describes the film as a story of \\"self sacrifice,\\" which is funny if you're familiar with Ayn Rand.I've since watched the film, and I liked it. It's rather not-so-subtle with the ideology, but that's not surprising.I hope it sells well enough for Parts 2 and 3 to get made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, would recommend it to anyone","review":"Acting is just what the story calls for. Storyline is \\"ripped from the headlines\\", despite the story being written decades ago. Pace of the movie is perfect, not a thriller but keeps you on edge as things develop. In fact, as it ended I was sore that it had to end without tying up the story, and when Part II comes out I will be sure to see it. I think the casting is spot on.I believe many of the negative reviews are quite likely people with a political motivation, as I assume the negative reviews from the movie critics were probably derived from the same sentiment...which is a shame. I recommend this movie. It's not the best movie of 2011, but it's a great movie and it is a story all people, regardless of political ideology, should expose themselves to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good job, so far","review":"The book is a tome, about 1200 pages long. That's amazing when you consider the author typed this sucker out on an Underwood or Corona typewriter about 65 years ago. I can imagine her expression when her editor told her to work on a section located on about page 350. This movie is the first of a multi-part film mini-series. It is pretty true to the beginning of the book, and is about the only part of the book with a \\"happy ending\\". This series of films, if the future editions remain as true to the novel as this one, you will need a bottle of prozac to get you through the evening. This series will really make you think about the virtues of capitalism versus socialism/marxism. Then, compare what you are watching with the direction the USA is moving toward and the entire project will make you shudder to your soul. I recommend watching this series in order of production, so you don't miss your opportunity to snap up a prozac."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on Story","review":"Very light on telling enough of the story to get the feeling of what is going on. Does not go into the feelings of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is awesome; Movie disappointment","review":"Acting and directing are really bad. Too bad since the novel is terrific. The idea that a few men can make new laws within days and that the fate of the economy revolves around a few characters is just silly. Hard to keep interest when the story and actors are so ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie","review":"This is an amazing movie. The story was written in the 1930s but is so revelant with what's going on in todays world. A must watch in order to see the sequel that opens Nov 2012 in theatres. Excellent movie a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanting moe","review":"I fall asleep watching this so did my wife. So, I guess that says it all! Was much slower than I thought from the trailers. But, I'm not paying to rent it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very scary","review":"Hard to imagine someone would actually depict the dilemma this country is embroiled in.so many years later. Now to see Shrugged part 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Compromise","review":"In adapting this book that has significant depth and breadth, the film did a good job compromising between having a manageable story and including the basics. You'll miss some of the more extensive character development of those out of the mainstream story such as Midas Mulligan, Hugh Akston, and Ellis Wyatt. The main characters have enough development to not appear as disjoint while the plot unfolds. I was impressed with the depiction of the John Galt line and the modernization of the background. For example, there is a plausible explanation why the rail continues to be important. For those who have not read the book, watch the movie then read the book. By then, perhaps the next one will be outand any remaining holes will be filled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlas Shrugged","review":"I read the book twice, loved it, this movie was disappointing. It did not capture the true essence of the book. They try to tell the story through dialogue. Hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I loved this movie! So with the times of how the government is deciding who fails and who suceeds and how it drives capitalism into the ground. I find it horrible how many people are truly blind to the crony capitalism happening in our government at our expense. How our government officials are making laws on us that they have written themselves out of like \\"Insider Trading\\", and not having to pay Social Security or having to use Obama Care like the rest of us have to. Why isn't the Wall street protesters marching on congress? In the movie when his wife doesn't see the thought behind the bracelet from his first pour of steel from his efforts and she didnt appreciate it because it wasn't silver or gold. Can't wait for part two. I will buy several copies for family and friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Don't know which is worse, the book or the movie. Premise is ludicrous.

Not in keeping with a certain political party's \\"family values\\" agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so but The Fountainhead was much better.","review":"Attacking the \\"liberal elite\\" is so worn out & appears to be a knee-jerk reaction by some to make excuses for poor to middling reviews or reactions. I thought this movie was OK but I really loved \\"The Fountainhead\\" - it was a hoot. However, as a Catholic, I view Ayn Rand's polemics of Selfishness to be morally evil & ultimately unrealistic - if all the geniuses left America & founded their own exclusive country, which she had proposed - who would do the farming, manufacture cars, stoves, clothing, & other such grunt work that successful business people relegate to the \\"lower classes\\"? What happens if an offspring has physical or mental disabilities & don't become geniuses within the community - infanticide? A well made horror film is a well made horror film & a poorly made horror film is a poorly made horror film. Don't fabricate political agendas of the reviewers to fit your own biases."},{"rating":"1","title":"The novel is atrocious: the film even more so","review":"Hot dog I can't wait for part 2 where we see how the Utopian word full of movers and makers, groovers and shakers fulfill their potential to the brim and the results that come from this world.Wait, it has already been released. Oddly enough it was before Part 1 of the film was even finished. Its called BioShock."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!","review":"After listening to Atlas Shrugged on audio book several times over the last three years I was excited to see the new movie so I bought it from Amazon. Have buyers remorse, this movie version is horrible! The book by Ayn Rand is a master-piece, this piece of video does it no justice at all! I know it's supposed to be a \\"modernized version\\" bringing the story line up to date however the plot jumps all over the place. The casting is terrible! The charactors are miscast to say the least. They are wooden two dimensional and totally unbelievable! Save your money! This isn't worth it if it were free! Very disappointed! The theme music is nice however. Anyone that disagree's with this review is clueless with low standards. If you would like a great experience get the audio book version from Audible.com read by Scott Brick."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE letdown","review":"HUGE letdown. Instead of trying to remake the book exactly as was, should have taken the concepts and projected them on a contemporary or futuristic story. Instead, shackled to the impossible job of replicating the original, you get a wooden caricature, with shallow acting and cliche lines. For me the worst part was that I really wanted to take my 11 and 15 year old's to see it to learn about capitalism, but the totally unnecessary and gratuitous sex scene was the final straw that said this was not worth watching. Instead of capitalism, I'd have to explain adultery. This film had the opportunity to win a new generation of fans, but instead gave detractors even more ammunition to criticize Objectivism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"Shortly after this DVD became available on Amazon there were national TV reports about there being a completely reversed characterization of Ayn Rand's philosophy included with the DVD. Supposedly the studio/mfgr would provide the correct insert if you contacted them via a provided Web site.When I did that I thought I would receive the correct insert in the mail. I never did. Instead I received an invitation to purchase a special collectable edition of the DVD direct from them, not Amazon.I purchased a second DVD from Amazon. I have no way of knowing if there is the same problem with the second DVD since I have opened neither.If others have similar experience I suspect this will end up as a follow-up report on national TV. Good for advertizing the DVD, but not necessarily good for Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"I remember loving Atlas Shrugged when I read it as a very political teenager. I was happy to order the first segment of the movie version. Wow! What a disappointment! No fire in the characters. They sort of whimper along. No energy between them. I won't be ordering the 2nd part, that's for sure. Glad Ayn Rand isn't around to see what has become of her ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful","review":"Haven't read the book and don't plan to, but a film should stand on its own, for people who haven't read the book. Using that criteria, this is a terrible movie in every way: poorly written, poorly acted, poorly directed, and worst of all, it's boring.If you're going to be bad, at least be entertainingly bad. To be fair, it has some nice cinematography, but so do travelogues. I guess Ayn Rand fans love it though, so more power to them. There's a market for just about anything (anyone remember the \\"Left Behind\\" series?) Others beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politics Aside it's a BAD movie","review":"Too many people are giving this a 5 star rating simply because of their ideology.We shouldn't care about right wing or left wing..it should only be about entertainment.The screenplay did not bring the famous novel to life, on top of it the acting was perhapsthe worst I've seen.If you want to watch the movie for entertainment purposes only then this is not the movie for you.If you simply want a movie to agree with your political theory and you don't care about quality then this is for you as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"The plot and pseudo science fi writing is so implausible its impossible to even suspend disbelief for a minute. I had to laugh at the scenes where they find some break through technology behind a wall in an old abandoned TRAIN factory in Wisconsin (har) and spend the next several scenes trying to find the dork who invented it, while rather random people seem to omnisciently know the exact next person they should go see. Sort of a weird combination of DaVinci Code and Tucker LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Characters might be too strong a word...","review":"I was disappointed that such a well-touted story would have such lackluster characters. For all the alleged intellectual and philosophical contributions, the debate presented so impractically one-sided that it misleads viewers into believing there are no alternatives to Dagny's beliefs.Atlas' characters have all the depth and subtlety of a comatose beauty queen. The protagonists are perfect and completely interchangeable self-inserts. Meanwhile, the antagonists might as well be played by Sauron and his army of orcs.In fact, I'm not the first to make the comparison:\\"There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.\\"I'm afraid the same may apply to the movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background knowledge required","review":"When I first read the book I never expected it to turn into a movie. It's long, the characters are all business men, and there are quite a few philosophical speeches. This definitely isn't \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The movie felt like a heavily summarized version of cliff notes (worse than \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"). The dialog jumped from point to point without ever forming a complete thought, relying on your memories of the book to give it any relevance. The acting was far from good, however that may have just been the best any actor could do with such an \\"abridged\\" script.Should you watch this movie? If you have netflix and you and your spouse liked the book: Maybe, if you can't find anything better to do. Otherwise, there's no point. The movie needs your knowledge of the book, but the book is a better memory without the movie.Where are all the cigarettes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very badly made","review":"Ordered for husband he was very disappointed as there was actually no ending to the movie and he claims it was very poorly done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job","review":"It followed the book closely and the actors did a good job portraying the lead characters quiet strength.

If you have never read book, this movie is not going to give you any real insight as to what the book is really, really, about and so do not recommend. READ THE BOOK. Ok, so you have read the book..... being a fan, I must admit it was nice to actually see actors with names I know so well and yes, there are some dramatic moments but this film fails in conveying the underlying evil, thought, policies that have such good intentions and wind up killing the goose that lays the golden egg.

If you do happen to get it... well you'll understand.

I was interested and entertained throughout. I've never read the book, but wanted to. This movie only covers the first part of the book, and the cliffhanger of sorts at the end of this movie leaves me wanting to know what happens next.The acting is not what you'd get from a big budget Hollywood production, but it was good. You'll see some familiar faces, and the actors portray the characters well, I think.The picture and sound are what you'd expect from Blu-ray. Good quality.It's striking to see the similarities in our national government today and that of the book that Rand wrote so long ago.I did not see this in the theater although I wanted to.

So I'm not going to debate the principles of Objectivism, nor shall I discuss the literary merits of Atlas Shrugged. No, I'm only going to mention that my hopes for Atlas Shrugged Part 1 -- the first installment of a planned trilogy -- tumbled like the housing project in The Fountainhead. In the year 2016, a group of individualistic industrialists are being targeted by the forces of mediocrity and socialism. It's up to Dagny Taggart and Henry Rearden to save the nation from economic ruin -- and maybe find out who some guy named John Galt is. I found Atlas Shrugged, Part 1 to be a low-budget bore that does little to elucidate Rand's ideas; if you're a fan of the book, however, you may want to give the Blu-ray a shot, as it contains several making-of docs and a commentary track with the filmmakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"What William Buckley thought","review":"Talking to Rose, about the patron-saint of the conservative movement , Bill buckley chats about ayn and her magnum opus atlas shrugged.

Three movies, actually. But this was done well. The actors looked like I thought they should for the characters -- except Francisco D'Anconia, who seemed a bit too shaggy to me. All of them were unknowns, which I kind of liked, and all were really good actors. I wondered if the people who made the movies were going to skip over the long speeches, and they did, which I think was a good call. The movie didn't show everywhere.

Atlas Shrugged is certainly that, but it is also much, much more. Ayn Rand's ability to come up with a story is marvelous, but it is the genius of HOW she tells a story which is absolutely remarkable. This genius is obliterated completely to shreds in the movie.I understand the limitations of the screen format, but if such an injustice could have been foreseen in the slightest, then this movie should have not been attempted.I would suggest listening to Atlas Shrugged the audio book recorded by Christopher Hurt.

I think that the experience of this movie is going to be completely different for people who haven't, and I can't speak to it. However, as a fan of the book, I found the movie entertaining. It is surprisingly well done, given both the challenges inherent in adapting this book to film, and the enormous amount of bad press it has gotten. I also found it engrossing to an extent that it probably didn't deserve as a film standing alone, because the book is such an emotional ride, and the movie causes you to re-experience all of that in such rapid succession.

Ms. Rand would have been proud of that I think.A few favorite things from the book left out, but that usually happens with large books. This one only deals with part 1 which itself is equal to a large book.Just a few minor things keep me from giving it 5 stars. I would give it 4 and a half if I could.

I saw this movie when it came out on April 15, 2011 and liked it well enough to order the DVD. The episode was the first trip on the railroad opened to the Colorado Mines. Dagny had told the railroad union representative that she would run the trip to Colorado if she had to be the engineer herself. There was a long line of engineers volunteering to drive the train for its first trip. Then on the first trip there were people lined up all along the tracks cheering this maiden run on the Rearden Metal tracks and bridge also constructed from Rearden Metal. The movie itself was entertaining if not great. It is indeed a very hard story to do as a movie but at least they tried. Even though this movie was not great I look forward to the second installment.

Although I have not read THE FOUNDTAINHEAD yet (I will), I did see the film starring Gary Cooper. The film version of ATLAS SHRUGGED is a 1,000 times better. Gary Cooper admired Rand but he read his lines rather than acting them out.The performance within ATLAS SHRUGGED is much better. It is slow-moving and has no comic relief that we often find in dramatic presentations. This may be consistent with Rand. I have never seen her smile or giggle. Perhaps that is the sign of that time.

Old book meets new technological world. Written when railroads were at their most popular I think that the writers did a good job making the story modern.

Not enough real dialogue, instead we get either a word for word from this dated novel, or a comic book version designed to minimize audience misunderstanding. Give the audience more credit than that and make this second film a little more subtle. Infer that a socialist head of industry does what he shouldn't in the name of the \\"greater good\\".I found Dagny Taggert a good enough character but Henry Rearden could use a deeper voice.

It's easy to use and it's really cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Egg Yolk separator","review":"The Egg Yolky works very well and as promised.The yolk gets separated perfectly.Good product for people like me who have had trouble trying to separate the yolk using traditional methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it :)","review":"I'm really happy with the product. It works, it's cute, and it was cheap. You can't argue with that. The only problem I have with it is that it doesn't clip to bowls with wide edges, but that's not a big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need three hands to use...","review":"It's a great concept and really cute, but, it's very small and doesn't sit on a measuring cup or standard bowl, which means you're stuck holding it in one hand and breaking the egg with the other - something I'm not talented at. If you place the product in the bowl and pour the whole egg into it, it creates such a mess that it's better off just separating the egg the old fashioned way. I would choose an egg separator with a long handle that'll extend across a bowl or measuring cup. Otherwise, you'll need three hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"So simple but so great","review":"I've started trying to eat healthier so egg whites was a no-brainer. Sadly, getting actual egg whites from eggs was more than annoying until I got this. It works GREAT. Just clip it to your bowl and crack the egg and viola.2 notes:1. The bowl clip is slightly finicky in that it won't attach to EVERY bowl. It works best on thin bowls that don't have a lip, meaning if it's a thin straight up side for it to attach on it will have best results like that.2. It's best if you crack the egg right over the device. Don't try to be goofy and crack it a foot or 2 above.I can easily recommend this for anyone who wants a cheap, easy way to get your egg whites."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"this product is a complete waste of money! use your hands people! i use large eggs and the product brakes the yokes and the whole thing goes through it. i hate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Egg Yolky Sham","review":"The only reason I bought this item was because I received a $25.00 gift card which gets you NOTHING in Amazon because you end paying through the nose in shipping cost. Take my advise skip this joke of an item which can't even attach properly to a bowl. You are much better off using your hand to filter the yolk, chefs do it all over the world now its your turn to practice...save your cash, use your hand to separate your yolk its much quicker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Egg Yolky is Jolky","review":"When I can get it to stay on the bowl it works fine.

I jumped on the internet and found the Egg Yolky. Of course it does a great job seperating eggs so far it has done 2 dozen with no problems. What makes this stand out is how cute the Eg Yolky is. It is well made, the paint is viberant and all of our guests have commented on the egg yolky. I have already bought one as a gift.

I learned that when the review describes a character as \\"intimate friendship\\" on the back cover it's an indication that there is implied homosexuality written within the story. Other than that I enjoyed the hetersexual relationships protrayed, however the book could be condensed by a couple hundred pages and still spike interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone let me know how it ends","review":"I made it through 400 pages of this book and I'm not sure how or why I got that far and I can't muddle up the energy to finish it. I found the characters to be overly stereotypical, completely predictable and just plain dull. The only one who had any depth at all was Anne. The conversations were boring, especially the political ones. The entire scandal about lesbianism was anticlimactic and dull - how did anyone find it enticing or exciting?I expected to love this book as I was captivated by Ms. Donoghue's SLAMMERKIN. This does not even compare. I only wish I hadn't run out and bought it so quickly-should have borrowed it from the library and saved a bundle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"After reading Slammerkin, and enjoying it so much, I was excited to start reading Life Mask. It did not get my attention right away, but I kept reading, thinking the book would get better. After reading 300 pages I finally gave up. There is a potentially interesting story between Anne Damer and Eliza Farren, but it is lost in the multitude of unimportant characters and the politics of the times. I had great expectations for this book and author, but I ended up being very disappointed. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanted to like...","review":"I read the first 150 pages but could not go on. I found this book boring and shallow. Characters have little depth and the plot is very unstructured which didn't grab my attention. The character's speech also seems very forced and unnatural. Sorry, but I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe she wrote this","review":"Frankly speaking, this novel is meaninglessly long. I can't believe the author of such a good story as Slammerkin can write this bad novel. The plot progresses painfully slowly and all the characters are colorless and disembodied. Hard to identify with any. In short, she is not in the league with Philippa Gregory, the author of many period novels. If you liked Donoghue's Slammerkin, then, don't read this. You will be hugely disappointed by her literary misadventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Mask/ Emma Donoghue","review":"Life Mask was a very good read. Each time I picked it up, I was transported in time. The author made me feel that I knew each character and their motivations intimately. Her ability to express female emotion through the written word reminds me of Tolstoy.I am a fan of english history and have read a good deal about the french revolution. I believe that added alot to the meat of the story.As for the sex bits, well, the hint of erotica is always better than the deed.If you've just finished Tipping The Velvet, don't go right into Life Mask, it'll be way to subtle for you. However I highly recommend Slammerkin. Emma Donoghue is a great find for me, I can't wait to read Hood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary, dreary, dreary","review":"How can an experienced author drag you kicking through 600 pages of what should be an exiting and colorful period in English history? I did want to see what happened, but it took so long to develop that at the end I didn't really care what became of the dreary characters. I can't believe I read the Whole Thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"I loved Donoghue's novel, Hood, but Life Mask was a big snore, eventhough I usually love historical novels. I found the writing stilted and the characters boring: they didn't seem very sympathetic or real. I trudged through about one hundred pages before I just started skipping through reading various sections to find out what happens: nothing. I wanted to like this novel, but needless to say I was very disappointed with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing \\"demonic\\" and harmful is the book its self...","review":"Twisted, agenda-driven propaganda is the prime tool of any liar.

First, Phil Phillips is a lunatic. Secondly, Phil Phillips is a lunatic. Finally, Phil Phillips is a lunatic. The author obviously has no idea how the brain of a child works. I won't say that this is just a right wing fanatic witch hunt, because I really do think that Mr. Phillips is trying to help people, but he needs to have a broader base research and at least consider the opinions of those who don't agree with him. When you write on what is mainly a subjective idea, you need to listen to more than just one side of the story. The only part of this \\"shocking expose\\" that flat out scares me is the fact that Mr. Phillips seems to think that the toy manufacturers are conspiring to turn the children of the world to Satan. Oh well, at least he's trying to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hillarious, yet sad...","review":"Phil Phillips does an excellent job of showing how logical consistancy and knowledge of child developement and psychology aren't important in raising a child. While many of the segments of the book keep me laughing for days, it makes me sad that ANYONE would take this book seriously. As a Christian, it makes me sad that such ignorance would be allowed to get printed. Most of his points are completely unsupported and often blown out of proportion. If you want a good laugh buy the book, but if you are seeking real Biblical counsel on how to help your kids, stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll see Demons in your Oatmeal!!!","review":"This guy sold this book to sell fear in the name of GOD for profit. He is a disgrace to humanity and a very close-minded one-dimensional thinker that only sees evil in everything except the bible. The author \\"Phil Phillips\\" also appeared on a program called The Eagles Nest \\"Deception of a Generation\\" hosted by another fearmonger named Gary Greenwald in 1984. It was to promote this book and unfortunately it scared enough parents to betray their children by throwing away their children's favorite toys for nothing. According to Phil Phillips, pretty much every toy sold in the 80's would give you a front row seat to hell and membership into Satanism. His book isn't based on any facts and at many times stretches to convey anything that can be mistaken as truth. I wouldn't be surprised if \\"Phil Phillips\\" isn't involved in some type of David Koresh or Jonestown cult these days. Do NOT waste your money on this garbage. If you want to be scared, buy a Stephen King novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious Read","review":"I saw this book at the secondhand book store and bought it based only on the hilarity of the back cover. I thought it was a parody, but it turned out the author was actually serious.The book delivers just what you'd expect from it-- a brainwashing and biased view of what are now classic and beloved toys and animated programming from the 1980's. It's a shame that people are that obsessed with hating toys and cartoons that much.It's one of the funniest books I've ever seen-- and can't possibly be taken seriously at any point. I will say one thing though-- the author is rockin' that sweater in the back cover portrait.

It's this kind of legalistic crap that keeps Christians in the dark ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Turmoil\\" is Terrible!!","review":"I actually purchased this book when it first came out and really thought it was insightful! Then again, I also believed that the \\"New Age Movement\\" was infiltrating and corrupting Christendom,that \\"backward masking\\" and \\"subliminal advertising\\" were genuine threats, and that the earth was only about 10,000 years old! Over-the-top, hysterical and ignorant fear mongering in the name of Christ is nothing new, just look at the hand-wringing over Harry Potter. \\"Turmoil in the Toybox\\" is absurd to say the least. I'm glad I realized that long before having kids of my own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The star is for entertainment value...","review":"But I wasn't really entertained, as I am a serious Christian (gasp, fundamentalist, even), and I was embarrassed for Mr. Phillips as I read this book. He is WAY over the top in his criticism of toys and cartoons. Yes, there are a few legitimate concerns that he raises, but those can be taken care of by parents being aware of what their kids are watching and pointing out how some of what they see differs with Christian values. Better yet, just turn the TV off! Anyway, I saw Mr. Phillips in person years ago and was intrigued enough to buy the book...and then embarrassed that I fell for it and had spent money on it. After so many years (I think I bought the book close to 20 years ago), the book seems kind of funny now, if I didn't know that there are people out there who will take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding","review":"All who read this book WILL become insane....It doesn't matter if its from the frustation of wondering where the rantings of this lunatic author come from.

I see no other psychological reason at the madness he spews into this so-called book other than simply having too much time on his hands.Wake up, Mr. Phil Phillips! THEY ARE CARTOONS! Make-believe!

This is probably the worst piece of propganda I've come across. It is so juvenile and devoid of any sense of reality.

The fact that the author really believes the things he writes is very frightening, but not quite as frightening as the fact that people have bought, read & believed this crap.

Don't let someone else do your thinking for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining foray into the mind of a lunatic","review":"I have to admit, I was entertained by this book from beginning to end, in a sort of car-wreck-by-the-side-of-the-road way. It's really amusing just how far some people can take their own personal beliefs. Phil Phillips is definitely one tree short of a hammock and while it frightens me to see blatant proof that these sorts of people are out there, his book provides hours of laughter for those of us who grew up with these toys and turned out just fine, thank you very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow","review":"I acquired this literary goldmine the other day and I must say it has become very precious to me. No matter how trying life becomes, I can always open to any page of 'Turmoil in the Toybox', and everything is allright for a while.

Here's two pages worth of writing: \\"Sometimes all day in the window he'll sit... All by himself or with his sister Bridget\\". That somehow fills TWO pages and there are only 13 pages of text!The first page mentions eating cantaloupe and that's the last time anything about cantaloupe is mentioned in the book. I thought good stories (even kid's books) were supposed to tie the subject matter into the story more than once!!The book design itself is nothing special. The illustrations are OK, but not that engaging. I definitely was hoping for a better story.Dr Seuss.... now those are children's books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Cat's Tale for Young Readers","review":"My two year old grandson takes great delight in his book collection. He discovered \\"The Cantaloupe Cat\\" when he was only 18 months old and it immediately became one of his favorites. It's the first book he hands me to read and he now enjoys sitting on the floor and turning the pages himself. The text is especially child friendly and the illustrations are appealing to grown ups as well.

There might be a hint of DP flavor, but it's so light that my mind might be playing tricks on me wishing to taste it so badly.Also. it IS ONLY 4oz! just like the title says! that's $5/oz... I read the title then I saw the picture with three packages a little deceiving in my opinion I figured for $20 I was getting three 4oz packages. As far the other review saying the jerky is dry... It's jerky...It is not bad jerky but it doesn't taste like Dr. Pepper, and it is definitely not worth $5/oz.

This coffeemaker makes an absolute mess. It leaks when pouring so that you have 1/2 cup of coffee on the counter top every time you pour a cup. The lid is so tight to unscrew that I often can't do it and have to go find someone to unscrew the lid on the coffee to even pour it so that I can then clean up the counter from all the coffee that leaked down the side because of the faulty seal that held the lid on so tight I couldn't get it off anyway. Do yourself a favor and just purchase another brand. I tried to find a replacement pot thinking I was the only one with this problem and they've discontinued this model...imagine that?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"We had the first thermal carafe by black and decker and it was wonderful. It lasted about 15 years, so we bought this one. Whatever monkey changed the design never actually poured a cup of coffee from it before releasing it on an unsuspecting public. There is no position to turn the lid that doesn't stop coffee from dribbling down the pot. You have to ALWAYS pour over the sink because it is always going to drip and not a slow drip either. I now have to find another brand because the company that took over black and decker told me this is not a problem that they would fix because it does brew the coffee, the fact that you lose half you coffee down the sink is not an issue they deal with.

What a disaster. Our son gave this coffeemaker to us as a Christmas gift so we hate to give up but warm coffee on the counter just doesn't get it.

I had an old Spacemaker for about 10 years, and was happy with it until it just wore out. I am not happy with the new one at all. The installation design is terrible - more holes in the cabinet & the bolts stick up into the cabinet. It's difficult to put the carafe cover on & off & if it's not on exactly right, the coffee overflows all over the counter. The coffee is not hot enough to begin with, and cools off very quickly.

The first one died after about 7 years; the second lasted 4 years; #3 passed away at the ripe old age of 2 years, and my latest one has just died at 18 months. Enough already!It seems obvious that quality has been tossed out in favor of cost reduction. Black and Decker must be really squirming at what Applica has done to their good name.Since it seems that no-one else makes an under-the-cabinet coffemaker, I have to move on and put up with a standard, counter-cluttering, model - I simply cannot bring myself to spend $60 on what I know will be a substandard product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back To the Drawing Board","review":"We've had a Spacemaker Coffee pot now for just about forever.

You have to go back to it and push ON 15-20 times after the first time, no one likes watching coffee brew...And the coffee is never hot enough. I can't wait until a newer version comes out. Maybe that will have been fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to put a lid on in over 60 seconds or more?","review":"This seems like the perfect coffeemaker - everything looks great your setting your timer puting your water and coffee in your new coffeemaker feeling great about the purchase and thinking wow I finally found the perfect machine - you wake up the next morning to have that first cup of coffee from this wonderful machine and then it happens - dribbles of coffee are coming out - ok I will take off the lid I can live with that - I will just put it back on when I am through pouring my coffee - I thought, this is when it all sunk in this coffeemaker is not worth the aggravation I have had to deal with on a daily basis. Warm coffee and fights with the lid- I do not like confrontations so the last thing I want to do in the mornig is fight with my coffeemaker - if you have carpal tunnel or arthritis this pot will be a real pain- Hope this review helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"SpaceMaker below parr for the money.","review":"The Black&Decker Spacemaker Coffee Maker was a disappointment because it does not keep the coffee warm by completely shutting off after brewing and the opening for the pour spout is not big enough to allow the coffee to but more than trickle into your cup. You will have to take the lid off to get it to pour at a normal rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"B & D ODC425 Spacemaker Coffee Maker design flaws","review":"We replaced our parents old ODC325 for Christmas with the new ODC425. Unfortunately the previously great design has been compromised in the new design to the point where unit is a nightmare to use, and our parents would like us to return the unit. We have to agree that their gripes are valid, and here is why:Old design had glass carafe with flip lid. Easy to see coffee level, and easy to pour. New design has stainless steel carafe, so you can't see level. Also has poorly designed screw on lid that does not allow coffee to dispense at a practical rate. Lid is extremely hard to replace when removed also.Old design had bright visible red LED display that was visible from any angle. New design went to mini LCD display (like on a small calculator) that is NOT backlit, and is nearly impossible to read from any angle let alone straight on. So you can't tell if the pot is on or off, you can't see coffee level, and it is a pain to dispense coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great space saver","review":"Well, many words can describe the B&D. Saves space, easy to fill and keeps time. That's about all the good comments I have. The caraffe leaks all over the counter while pouring. I took the o-ring off of the lid to help reduce the spill. Didn't work. Finally bought a B&D glass pot to replce the caraffe, removed the gadget that allows mid brewing pour. Works great now! It brews cold coffee! Microwave now replaces warming function. C'mon B&D! Years of practice should result in perfect design. Is this outsourced to another country too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow! This wins the prize for the most BAD reviews!","review":"I'm glad I read these reviews. I had the old type of B&D Spacemaker that fit under the counter with brackets and had a glass carafe. I had it for 5 years and finally decided to replace it when it started leaking onto the counter and the water reservoir smelled slightly \\"swampy\\" no matter how many times I cleaned it. I was going to get another Spacemaker but after reading these reviews I decided to spend $5 more and buy the Hamilton Beach BrewStation. I sacrificed a few inches of counter space, but I'm very happy with it! I never realized that my old Space Maker didn't make hot coffee until I poured my first cup of HOT coffee from the BrewStation. I had problems with the glass carafe on my old Spacemaker dribbling but now it appears that problem is worse now with the newly-designed thermal carafe. Thanks for all the helpful reviews on the new, \\"improved\\" B&D Spacemaker! I'm glad I didn't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"this coffee maker is the worst maker i have ever had,i have had many. i would like to try to get my money back. we will be looking elsewhere. thanks again.

The idea of coffee going into a caraff and not continuing to cook on a hot plate is good, if the coffee got hot to start with. The lid that easily cross threads is most frustrating, let alone taking 30 seconds to dribble out a cup of coffee. After just 2 days with this new piece of junk I'm retreiving my old B&D space saver from the trash and cleaning it up for some more miles. For years before I poured a fresh pot into a seperate caraff to keep hot without over cooking. B&D new product team, you guys blew it big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"cold coffee","review":"If you like cold coffee, this model is for you. The coffee doesn't brew hot enough to stay hot in the carafe. We have to heat our coffee in the microwave then pour it back into the carafe for it to stay hot.

Was I ever wrong!! This has got to be the absolute worst coffee maker on the market today. It is impossible to pour a cup of coffee from the thermal carafe without spilling it. I purchased this item for TARGET (Can't recommend them either)and they refused to take it back because it was an open box item. Mr. Coffee / Wal Mart...Here I come........................."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spout is poorly designed","review":"The coffee stream when pouring is absurdly small and slow. The spout tends to drip coffee onto the counter when pouring. The lack of a channel in the spout causes the coffee to run outside the spout and down the side of the carafe. A small channel for the coffee does not seem like it would interfere with the carafe's ability to keep the coffee hot. The insulated carafe does keep the coffee hot well, but the mess when using it has caused me to search diligently for alternative under the counter coffee makers. I have had the machine less than a week. A different lid might help this issue as well. Turning the lid to seal the carafe is annoying. A push button on the handle that unseals the carafe to pour the coffee seems like a reasonable alternative. Without a channel for the coffee, though, this too would be a mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this coffee maker!","review":"I have had this coffee maker for 4 years & though it does dribble at times when I pour my coffee, it is really made to dispense coffee through the lower handle with the push button!+++s: it saves space on your counter, the timer works well & is simple to use, it's wonderful to be able to put water directly from the faucet into the water carafe, you don't have to worry about turning it off & best of all the thermos pot does not allow air to get to the coffe, so the coffee does not age nearly as quickly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit finger 11, a bit nickel back, a bit feul, all good","review":"I waited for the default cd for a month and a half before it came out. When it did arrive in stores on the 2nd I was able to swing around and get it the next day. This is a very good cd with four talented members putting it together. Their alternitive sound rolls very smooth and the vocals are a nice touch.Though this cd isnt perfect. Though their sound and style is well preformed it is in no way unique. Not every song is a hit but most of them are tolerable at the least in this short (37 minute) cd. The songs that really drive this cd home are \\"sick and tired\\", \\"wasting my time\\", and \\"somewhere\\".Default isnt the best new band around but they are solid. Expect good things in the future from this up and coming canadian band.

It wasn't a song that spiraled me into the nearest music store to buy the album, but it was far from boring. I loved Dallis Smiths voice and was only skeptical about buying the cd because I had a fear the other songs wouldn't even measure up to the single. Well, after many weeks and through multiple almost-purchases of THE FALLOUT, I finally broke down and bought it.I was pleasantly surprised.If you liked the single, but not quite enough to buy the cd, take comfort in knowing the cd is just as good and in many spots better.

And I don't like it now under the name Default. Just because a style of music is easy to make and easy to sell certainly doesn't make it good. This type of music is quickly going down the same road that cheese metal went in the late '80s.

I just can't see how people buy this and say in their reviews how original they are. This is not original at all ok, this is just the same old thing that gets overplayed on mtv and pop stations. If they where so original you couldn't think of a band simialiar to them, though thats not the case with this band, here are some bands who to me sound like default, nickelback, creed, new staind, 3 doors down and many more. If you want a band who's not to heavy and has talent, go check out system of a down, they are wacky not to heavy, and they have out standing vocals.

This album isn't going to suck you in with one infectious single and then proceed to rape you in the ally behind your apartment with 99.9% filler. Instead, Default offers up over ten tracks, and though they may smell of \\"new band syndrome\\", it isn't in a bad way. This is why I call this album \\"raw\\", it almost sounds like something an under budget group would record in their uncle's church. But again in a good way. This album is not tamed, it's wild, hard, and unapolegetic. Dallas's voice isn't trained or tamed here, it's rough and imperfect, that is one strike against the record. However it hardly changes my score, I think it's a brilliant record with some great tunes. This is a better back than Nickelback, and I find it puzzling how underrated they truly are in comparison.

Default's debut CD, \\"The Fallout\\" is a 32 minute disc that starts off strongly, but becomes trapped in its tired, trite, and generic alt-rock formula. It takes more than saying the name of the song four times in a row to make a memorable chorus (which occurs in close to all of the tracks), and for a disc of this short of length, it's not a good sign that it feels twice as long. If you enjoy bands like Nickelback and Three Doors Down, you might get something out of this release, but for me, I can't really put a high mark on a blatant showing of mediocrity and minimal effort.

Difficulties include: battery draining rapidly on chest strap when not in use, wildly inaccurate heart rate measurements, heart rate measurements get \\"stuck\\" with no apparent way to reset (outside of taking the battery out), losing the heart rate measurement part way through a workout and not getting it back . . .

It only explains history and general information such as population and capital, etc. If it could provide us more information on cultural differences in each country in order to let us know how they live, for example, their diet, housing conditions, education systems, fashions, festivals, it would be much more informational and vivid.

The sound when I barely press the pedal is annoying, I just hear all the rockers going back and forth. It sounds like I have a crack in my intake manifold. When I get on the gas, you can really hear the supercharger whining (the only reason this review deserves one star). The problem is that I keep romping on the gas so that I don't have to listen to the low end sounds.Bottom line on performance: no change. I don't feel any difference in horsepower, and just to test, I raced my in-laws in their stock 1999 Grand Prix GTP with this intake installed. I lost 3 times off the line, and to add to the aggravation, the 1999 GTP continued to pull away all the way until we hit 80 MPH every time. Granted, the 1999 GTP has a 200 lb. weight advantage, but the whole point of adding upgrades is to make a car faster.

These definitions are made much clearer in a standard real estate textbook. The majority of the book is spent giving examples of others creative exploits. Little information is given on actually becoming a creative investor. Perhaps part of the problem was the fact that this book was written twenty-one years ago. I'll bet even if this were the most updated version there would still be much better books out there. Even though there are only 270+ pages, I struggled to finish reading it.

The final, 10-page chapter is devoted to teaching us how to enjoy being rich.That being said, the author presents many standard and some less common principles of real estate investment.

After a few days of relief from this mouse, I started carrying it around the office and putting it in my purse to take home with me.That said, the mouse was too big for my smaller-than-average hands. The size problem created some tension at the base of my wrist. It was still DEFINITELY worth using, but would have been even better if there were a version for people with medium to small hands.Two years after I bought it, I dropped the mouse on the floor and the buttons popped out.

My perfectly functional laptop did not recognize the USB connect, and none of the limited instructions provided by Evoluent worked. In addition, the company provides no phone tech support for product owners.I have installed many dozens of USB-compatible devices over the past several years, and the computer always at least recognizes the install. I am returning the mouse to Evoluent, and my search continues for an ergonomic device.Believe the bad reviews about this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"The only thing that takes a little getting used to is this:Because klicking a button is done by horizontal force (instead of vertical with a traditional mouse), inadvertently sometimes the mouse is moved when trying to click so as to miss the target.

Because of its weight, it takes a lot of effort to shove this mouse around the desk and it also takes a firm grip. Hmmm. Firm grip, wrist problems. This is not a happy combination. I also had problems with the way the bottom outside edge was shaped, making it uncormfortable to rest my pinkie there. My hands are average-to-large for a woman, so I wonder who this mouse was designed for. Not for me, that's for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Have XP or Vista certified drivers","review":"I had high hopes for this mouse- it seemed to be at the convergence point between a regular mouse and some pretty esoteric shapes. I simply couldn't get it to work on two of my XP machines .... It also required me to remove ALL of my other wireless connections ... eg: MS 7000 keyboard. Sorry. A double deal breaker. It didn't matter whether I used the install disks that came with the mouse or the updated ones I downloaded from their site.

No way!","review":"Yes, my fingers don't go to sleep anymore but my wrist hurts so badly that I can't use the darn thing. Not worth the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"did not help me","review":"I bought this mouse to help with my forearm, wrist, and hand pain from excessive mouse use. After using it a while, I did not find it helped any. I did not like the feel of the mouse - it is bulky and feels awkward in my hand. Also, your hand cannot really relax while it is rested on the mouse because of the shape and the fact that the buttons are very easy to depress. I also did not like the pointer control - it was very jumpy. The inventor tries to make the argument that the \\"handshake\\" position is better and more natural because the forearm bones are not crossed. I think that is bogus because when your arms are relaxed at your side, they are typically pronated and the radius and ulnar are crossed. This is not unnatural or uncomfortable. I switched to the Logitech trackball and like it a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not so good at the same time","review":"When i first recieved my verti mouse i was impressed. I work on a computer 9 hours out of the day and wanted a more ergo mouse and thought this was the answer.

For this reason i sold it to a buddy and went back to a regular mouse. Construction is top notch though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality - Does not last","review":"Eventhough this is a great design and eliminates wrist pain, the device does not last.

A mouse should last for many many years, not just one year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mouse design so far","review":"I just started using the mouse and already know I won't go back. The concept is so simple you'll wonder what took so long. You're basically holding a mouse sideways while it rests on the pad. And this means your wrist is in a natural position.Multiple buttons allow you to choose what works for you. I hate roller wheels and don't need to use it or notice even notice it on this mouse. But it works too for those who want it.My only gripe is I have larger hands and offering a somewhat larger version as 3m does would get the product every single star rating.Don't wait until that version is offered however, save your wrists now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward mouse, helped my wrist but hurt my hand","review":"I tried this device for about 3 months a while back. It helped me at the beginning by reducing the tension on my wrist, but then it began generating pain along the edge of my hand, so I stop using it.The idea is interesting and valid, the natural position for the wrist is sideways and not twisted down.The problem is that there is no base to rest the lower edge of the hand, so that part gets stressed out.Of course everybody's ergonomics needs are not the same, but I recommend instead the3M Ergonomic Mouse SMALL/MEDIUM, which have been working great for me (3 years now)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good service","review":"This is my second one of these. I had the original model for over 5 years and it saved my arm. Unfortunately, Evoluent did not create new drivers for my old one and as Microsoft updated over the years, the drivers ceased to work properly forcing me to buy a new model. I like this one, it's a speed demon, but I am very unhappy with the manufacturer for not keeping up the drivers. It's like Quicken does now, their product will work for 2 years for online banking and after that, you gotta buy the latest version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't help","review":"It is difficult to accurately control the pointer with this mouse.

I did not find this mouse to be helpful. All it did was increase stress on my shoulder. I have found that using the computer less has been more effective to me than trying to strain my body in an even more awkward position that this mouse makes you do. Of course, individual results may vary and I applaud any company that even attempts to make things easier. I don't understand how the \\"handshake\\" position is any better. Not using the computer period, or using it less, seems to be more effective. good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Evoluent mouse doesn't fit my hand","review":"I bought the hype and purchased an Evoluent VerticalMouse3 Rev 2 and used it for a week, increasingly noticing the soreness in my wrist and thumb.

Don't buy this if you have less than a normally-sized hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with KVM","review":"I really, really want this to work. When I plug it directly into my computer, it's great; I like the movement, the ergonomics, the button placement. But when I plug into my KVM (an iogear GCS932UB), no go. It randomly gives me horizontal and scrolling, but no movement. This is a pure USB KVM too -- no PS/2 or adapters in the way. Turning on and off mouse emulation does nothing. I spent 45 minutes doing the dance of plugging and unplugging every cable in the system in different order, but no dice. Oh well, back to the drawing board.I'd highly recommend this item and give it five stars if you're plugging straight into a single PC, but be warned if you use a KVM - it might not work for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"crapped out","review":"For this price, I am appalled that the mouse is essentially unusable after three months.

Really helped with the hand fatigue of sitting at a computer all day. Instantly solved the pain in my wrist & forearm. It was also easy to adjust to, since it is just a regular mouse turned sideways.

So when I listened to this album I was surprised, big time. I had not heard something so original in a long-long time. Different BUT interesting. In simple terms, it sounds somewhere like a mix of Pat Metheny, Bill Frissell and Andy Summers with an atmospheric tripi-groove.

So if you're a fan of any of the pickers on this cd, or new to Mark O'Connor, or just want to hear some of the best live acoustic picking ever to be caught on tape, buy this. You will NOT regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amazing thing I've ever heard","review":"Virtuoso is an understatement for any of these guys. Bryan is my absolute hero (I'm a guitar player as well, or at least like to say such, but it's hard to say as much while he exists.) I've criticized fiddler's albums before for having too much fiddle (Aubrey Haynie's The Bluegrass Fiddle Album, e.g.) but here Mark is tasteful and variant even on the tunes where it's just him. Chris tears it up, putting it lightly, but also plays to the part. Something about these guys' playing seems like that is the only way it could be played. It is the goal of a musician to be compared to them. I can't say enough about it, just buy the album, if you like instrumental music AT ALL, it will quickly rise to the top of your 'best CDs' list."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nation's Health","review":"This was the first time I used Amazon for a text for class, worked out wonderfully.

The music is emotional and moving: it's dark, solemn, powerful, and mysterious at times.

The result is simple: Brian Tyler has done a beautiful job creating this soundtrack for an epic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds a touch of the exotic to Dune","review":"I'll be honest, I haven't even watched the Sci-Fi Children of Dune miniseries yet. However, I was looking for a new soundtrack to listen to while I read and came across [Children of Dune. So far, I have mixed feelings. It's a good soundtrack - at least 4 stars - but nothing too exciting. In fact, it's a bit forgettable. I prefer Graham Revell'sFrank Herbert's DUNE - Original Soundtrack from the Sci-Fi Channel MiniSeries. It's got a more unique flavor to it.

The great advantage of these screws is that their self-tapping tips are significantly less likely to split smaller wood pieces than are conventional wood screws.

This video is very hard to follow. Many different theories about who killed him and why Jimi was killed. At least 35 minutes out of the 60 are a hard to follow biography of Jimi's career from 1967 to 1970; I don't know how much of that was even believeable. Don't waste any money or time on this. If you are really interested in the truth about Jimi's demise do a google search or read some books. But we will never really know. And this dvd doesn't help at all.

I never really thought about how much work and attention to detail that the people \\"behind-the-scenes\\" went through to make such a production happen. It was especially fun to see the actors out of their 'Pride and Prejudice' make-up; some of them looking entirely different than the character they portrayed.

Like the featurette on the DVD, it explains a great deal about the costumes, the choreography, the musical score and determing locations for the various well known places that the audience visits during the program. What is not on the featurette and is in the book is insight into what the performers were feeling during this major film event, expecially the primary characters of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy portrayed by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. It is very interesting to hear their thoughts as they approached their roles. And it is also very apparent as you go through this book that everyone responsible for actually getting this on film loved the book and are fans of Jane Austen. Very nice indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I highly recommend this book for any true die-hard fans of P&P. This has got to be the mother-of-all 'making of' books! There are many quotes and interviews from cast members throughout. As well, Sue Birtwistle goes into great detail about the production of P&P (e.g. how the food on the set was preserved, etc.).

I enjoyed the video in a renewed way after understanding Darcy's reasoning in key scenes. I would have liked more of this kind of in-depth interview from the other principal actors.

Furthermore the author has wasted much space in the book describing the programs, hardware etc that the architecture firms have employed, that is non-relevant and is extensively iterated that tends to annoyance and frustration for the reader.

While most of the tracks on here are immediately recongnizable as Rob Zombie, there are a few more slower paced tracks less characteristic of his style. Perhaps this is why most people seem disappointed by this release. This was my initial reaction as well, but upon listening to The Sinister Urge multiple times all the way through, I have found that it has begun to grow on me. The lyrics remain traditional Zombie with satire-like themes of evil, death, ect. Even though the album is short, each track seems to flow well into the next, giving it a balanced sound. It might not live up to the reputation of Hellbilly Deluxe, but I believe The Sinister Urge is still worth a listen to fans of Rob Zombie and the heavy metal genre in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Zombie, *distilled*","review":"Rob Zombie makes the music HE likes, which is the way any real artist should approach their art--never try to appease the masses or create what one thinks *other* people want. If its good, people will appreciate it.With that in mind, THE SINISTER URGE is, actually, an excellent album, only it is somewhat shorter than previous efforts. As the title says, \\"distilled\\". Compared to \\"Astrocreep 2000\\" and \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\", there seems to be less filler here; the only \\"filler\\" I see is the sampling, but it's filler with a purpose, as it helps add creepy atmosphere. When I say less filler than the other two albums, I mean that every song here is a potential hit--there aren't only 2 or 3 that are good, they're ALL good. I only wish the album was longer, but if that meant \\"filler\\" songs, what would be the point?

His attempt at going techno caught me off guard and turned me off immediatly. The album sounded to much like bubble gum pop. I am somewhat of a Zombie fan but since he went solo his music has suffered in my view. Hellbilly deluxe was a good album but nothing at all like the white zombie material. The only song on there that I liked was \\"House of 1000 Corpses\\". And why did he put Scum of the Earth on the album? It had been out for a year already of the mi2 soundtrack.

You can't always get what you want. This is for the true dedicated fan. For the rest, save some bucks and pass on this one. Fav picks: \\"Feel So Numb\\", \\"Never Gonna Stop\\" and \\"Demon Speeding\\" I guess my fav picks are predicatable since they were splashed on MTV.

This cd is pretty damn good and has a 'fast car, fast women' sound to it. Rob Zombie seems to have nightmarish visions and apparently applies these visions to his music much like an painter who applies his vision to canvas. The music mixes good fast rock and roll with the precision of techno and the horror of a good old fashion slasher flick.Dead Girls Superstar, Feel so Numb, Scum of the Earth, and House of 1000 corpses are my favorites today, but that usually changes with my moods. Either way the whole entire cd is very worth the purchase. I was not disappointed in the least. I felt, in fact, that this was a bit better than Hellbilly Deluxe.Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another killer disc from the Zombie himself!","review":"I got this cd and was impressed! The songs are what I would have expected from Rob. And a duo with Ozzy, now that kicks a--! But in my opinion, this rated as an excellent album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to Rob Zombie's Music","review":"I love this CD. I must have heard it a hundred times already. All the songs will be memorable. The songs are all good, but the weakest one is \\"Dead Girl Superstar\\". \\"Never Gonna Stop\\" and \\"Feel So Numb\\" are definitely the BEST songs on here. \\"House of 1000 Corpses is spine-tingling and disturbing. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Unbelievable","review":"Rob Zombie's 'Sinister Urge' quickly became my favorite out of my somewhat large CD collection. There isn't a single song on this CD that I don't love. I love the strings in some of the songs and the brass section in one of the others, and I just can't get enough of the orchestra in track 9. The best thing about this album is that at only 30 minutes long, it contains absolutely no filler. I can pop this CD in and just relax, and not have to worry about constantly skipping the songs I don't like. In my opinion, this CD is much better than Hellbilly Deluxe, and Rob's going to have to work really hard to out-do himself again."},{"rating":"1","title":"kind of a let-down","review":"This review is meant for those who own and love Hellbilly and haven't yet picked this up - be warned. Overall Urge sounds weak and watered down compared to its hard hitting predecessor. Although it has a few bright points it is by several orders of magnitude an inferior product to the timeless Hellbilly Deluxe. Although I continue to play Deluxe after several years of ownership, this one has languished virtually untouched since I bought it. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Zombie's best.","review":"Rob Zombie's sophomore solo album isn't quite as popular as his debut, Hellbilly Deluxe but personally I think it's just as good. It isn't as heavy but the songs are catchier, more enjoyable and memorable. Sinister Urge focuses more on industrial and electronic influences than metal. There are still several harder rock tracks but a few are more experimental and different like Transylvanian Transmissions Pt. 2. Never Gonna Stop and Feel So Numb are great songs but my personal favorite is (Go To) California."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent CD marred by copy-protection","review":"This sounds like a decent 3rd album, I heard it over a friend's place, and I would have bought it, but I'm boycotting labels that are cooperating with the RIAA because of their revenue grab on webcasters -- forcing myself and a lot of my friends out of business.Also, this CD has copy protection built in that will mess up your computer if you try to rip the tracks so you can listen to them on your MP3 player -- rather than lug around hundreds of CDs. That's right it will actually damage your computer!If you could get it from another source -- like directly from the artist -- I'd say get it. But since you can't, any money spent on this CD is feeding the RIAA and others who want to make a profit first and don't care if it's killing music.Thanks,MUPDATE: Later pressings of this album do not have copy protection. So, 8 years later I'm pretty sure you'll be able to get a clean copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass auf!","review":"Another good but different cd from Rob Zombie. This album includes great guitar riffage, an orcastra and some poppy elements that some older fans might not enjoy. The album is pretty short though with a filler track that's just a bunch of nonsense that I always skip. I guess it'd better to have a short cd with a lot of good songs than a cd with some good songs and a lot of bad songs. I really enjoyed all of the songs and most of them stand out except \\"bring her down\\" and \\"scum of the earth.\\" So go do yourself a favor and buy this disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robs as Rockin as he ever was!","review":"YOU da man rob! This cd is awsome little bit of a new sound to it but its still the same rob just a little bit of a jive added. Plus Iron Head has Ozzie in it Very cool Combo! I really recommend this cd to anyone who liked robs other cd Hellbelly deluxe. YOU will like this one trust me..if rob reads these reviews..KEEP ON ROCKIN ROB YOU DA MAN!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The urge rises, then ends abruptly...","review":"Sinister Surge has several really strong tracks. Instead of just copying what worked on \\"Hellbilly\\" and \\"Dragula,\\" he pounds out great song after great song. Some of my personal favorites are:\\"Dead Girl Superstar\\" which has a tremendous guitar riffs\\"Crippletown\\" which is slower, but doesn't lose it's edge\\"Iron Head\\" which is a duet with Ozzy\\"Feel So Numb\\" which has the coolest sample off the disk (from Manos the Hands of Fate)and \\"Demond Speeding\\" which can be downloaded off of this site.There were a few problems with this CD, however. Several of the tracks are non-musical samples from old horror movies. There is nothing wrong with that, except when the number of those is close to the number of real songs. The CD run time is about 35 minutes, too short. He pounds out song after song, and then just ends.Overall good, but just missing about 15 to 20 minutes to be a 5 star cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob Zombie....new CD...SAME sound.","review":"The new Rob Zombie CD isnt bad, its just not original. For the hardcore White Zombie/Rob Zombie diehard this is a must have. For all others, your money is better spent on a used copy of his earlier works. The music he has created has become a stale formula on this new CD, predictable. His last CD (remixes excluded) Hellbilly Deluxe wasnt bad, it just sounds like generic White Zombie, which is all Rob Zombie actually is. Astrocreep 2000 was groundbreaking supercharged demonrock. The first White Zombie cd rocked too. I even like alot of the remixes on their remix cds...but its almost like uses a random lyric generator to write his songs...theyre the same as previous CD's just switched around a little...maybe he was putting too much effort into his yet to be released movie....I dunno, go get Astrocreep 2000 and save 5 or 6 bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rob who?","review":"Since when did Rob Zombie start doing techno?

There were a few catchy songs like \\"Iron Head\\" which featured Ozzy and \\"Feel so Numb\\" which is hard to resist, but I just failed to buy into this album. Obviously Rob is exploring new sounds and exceeding the boundries, but to me, this is nothing like any Zombie. It seems more like a dance cd with its techno influenced backgrounds. There are very few songs where the bands just comes right out and do what they do best, play the damn instruments the way they were meant to be played. There is nothing more I can add except I am a bit let down by this release, as soon as I put this album on I turned it off in disgust after one time through. After making numorous efforts to buy into it, I just can't. End of story, I'll just have to go back to Hellbilly Deluxe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres the second cd...at..?","review":"Im sorry but 40 mins of album time is not long enough especially when much of the 40 is filler lead-ins and samples that have nothing to do with the actual music of the song.Like another guy has allready said, if u want heavy industrial metal with a killer punch get Rammstein's new disc Mutter which makes this lackadaisilic outing by Zombie seem like elevator music.Another thing, one of the 3 best songs on this album is not on the d%mn album!! I suggest downloading the song \\"American Nightmare\\" off the internet, try kazaa or morpheus, its a really good song.Best songs on the album-Bring her downFeel so numb....thats it, and altho feel so numb is a really catchy song, its Way to repetitive lyricaly, Rob needs to go back and listen to Astro-Creep a few times for some inspiration me thinks.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic, Phoned-in, etc.","review":"If you liked \\"Hellbilly Deluxe\\" for its catchy riffs, heavy beats, and diverse songs, then you may be disappointed with this CD. With a few exceptions, the music sounds pretty generic and boring, like Zombie had to slap together a CD in order to fulfill a contract to his record company while he filmed his movie. The songs \\"Feel So Numb\\" and \\"Dead Girl Superstar\\" are really pretty good & could have easily been on his last CD. However, some songs (\\"Demon Speeding\\", \\"Scum of the Earth\\", even \\"Iron Head\\") are sort of boring, while other songs (\\"California\\", \\"Bring Her Down\\", \\"House of...\\") just plain aren't very good.I personally was very disappointed, especially since I was such a fan of \\"Hellbilly\\". Nothing on this new CD is really as good as \\"Superbeast\\", \\"Dragula\\", \\"Living Dead Girl\\", or \\"Ballad of...\\", etc. I think that this could have been a much better CD with just a little more effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"***!!!

I've only owned it a month and in that time I think I've thrown out, sold, or donated about two dumpsters worth of things I was holding onto for all the wrong reasons. For the first time I'm enjoying getting rid of things, and making room to actually have places to put things away. Let's just say I used to browse for costume jewely in online auctions, but now I drool over storage accessories. Sigh. (Another lifelong clutterbug bites the dust.) In short: yes, I'd have to say that the book was very helpful, at least in providing that intial kick-start that so many of us pack rats need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't be called \\"Unclutter Your Home\\"","review":"This shouldn't be called \\"Unclutter Your Home\\" as it focuses primarily on tacky ways to organize the clutter you already own. For example, store your panty hose in a plastic bag hung on a hanger. Sorry, but that just doesn't cut it for me! How about weeding through that massive collection of panty hose and only keeping the ones you absolutely love and use? This book may be useful for someone who is just beginning to try to reform their messy lifestyle, but I think it would be even more useful if it focused on methods that actually encouraged getting rid of the junk and uncluttering rather than storing the stuff you already have. If you are looking for an organization book, this may be a useful book for you. However, I tend to find that the solutions seemed a little tacky and not very astetically pleasing. I would recommend you get this book from the library first before you decide to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"7 Tips repeated 100 times","review":"I found this book to be a complete waste of money.I got sick of reading the same tips reworded and used over and over and over again,maybe Miss Smallin should have written a booklet instead of a book.If i could have given 0 stars i would have.Keep the clutter from your house,don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Novels","review":"I had read Dreamships a number of years ago and it has become one of my favorite novels over the years, so I was delighted to find that Melissa Scott had written a companion novel set in the same milleu.Dreaming Metal is not a traditional sequel, and can be read without any prior knowledge. However, it is a follow up to Dreamships and I think a reader who has read the earlier work will have a greater appreciation.The novel picks up some 5 years after the events of Dreamships, and chronicles the creation and growth of an entity which may be an artificial intelligence. The cast of characters is slightly different, and the writing is in some places extraordinary. Like Dreamships this is a slow paced character driven novel of ideas rather than an action packed adventure story.I think it compares favorably with the finest SF novels, and is one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning AI!","review":"This book was the first I've read by Melissa Scott, and I was not disappointed. I had no idea that it was a sequel to an earlier work, and it read like a new piece. The story follows three characters seperately and does a fine job of keeping you interested in the different aspects of their lives. My favorite was Fortune, the dancer. Celeste was quite a surprise at the end, reminiscient of Arthur C. Clarke's Hal 9000. I recommend this book to any science fiction fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"She has the edge that has been missing for a while","review":"I heard tracks from this album while in London and was determined to find it over in the US.

She also sings about just as much as she raps, which makes her album a great combination of both styles of performance. \\"Seed Will Grow\\" is a great song that has a reggae vibe to it. \\"It Takes More\\" is another hit song that has a great danceable beat.

With the help of producer John A. Rivers (Love and Rockets) and engineer Chad Blinman (Ichor, Das Ich) This Ascension set out to explore new territory both lyrically and musically. The first thing you'll notice is how the guitars are mixed more up front for a harsher sound. Also new on this release is the addition of percussionist Paul Sutherland. The musical scheme on this release changes from one song to the next. At times, the band sounds similiar to Love Sprials Downwards, Faith and the Muse and Mors Syphilitica. Don't worry though, the trademark This Ascension sound shines through on every song and with Sever they tend to wear their influences more openly on their sleeves. Die hard fans will agree that this release surpasses \\"Walk Slowly...\\" and that This Ascension will always remain one of the most well rounded Dark bands out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true gem","review":"I discovered this band recently, and I must say I'm very impressed.

As another reviewer mentioned, it works for ESL students as well. It amazes me that they can't be honest on what audience they're trying to target, but instead using the misleading name like Grammar Bible, and even in the description on the back cover they claim it's everything anyone would ever need to understand English grammar; how arrogant and narrow-minded is that?

In today's comic book (or graphic novel, if you really insist) market, where there are so many new issues with nothing beyond some occasional good color illustrations, it's very refreshing to see how entertaining a story illustrated in black-and-white can still be when proper respect is given to the characters and the audience.

The storyline involves a team of oceanographers setting up a network of underwater sensors. The premise of this film exemplifies the optimism about scientific discovery that was common in the early 1960s, although ironically, there are some serious scientific mistakes. Because the plot is so sparse, the film is mainly a collection of episodes. The characters are for the most part rather simplistic. The film's best asset is some spectacular underwater photography, but in the end the nice visuals are not really enough to sustain interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all!","review":"Excellent cast.

First, the finish appears chrome in the picture whereas it is actually a flat gray metallic finish on the sides, with chrome feet, top and sides.

It's great for a bedroom because it is practically silent. The heat is effective and it did what it was supposed to do...allow me to turn down the heat in the rest of the house at night while keeping the bedroom pleasantly warm. That was the good news. The bad news is that after a few months, it broke down. It turns OFF when you increase the heat by turning the thermostat up. As another reviewer said, it is now an attractive retro paperweight, but that's about it. I was considering having it fixed but after reading the parts hassle that others are having, I'm not going to bother. After battling with Delonghi over other retro products, I'm giving up. I won't buy any of their stuff anymore. By the way, if you want a great, silent heater, try the Bionaire Micathermic model (BNRBH3900U).

I had to return three of them. Thank you, Lowes, for your patience.The fourth one was a Delonghi HR715. It filled the bill as far as being totally silent.

Toaster BTU's, from a box the size of a small suitcase.My Holmes Quartz heater puts out at least five times as much heat, as reported by my shins. The problem is that both labels state that they consume 1500 watts of electricity.

ATLANTIS BLACK? APOCOLYPSTIK? Who cares!?!? Well, someone might care if these covers were any good, but really all the songs on here are tired and uninspired.

The fitted sheet no longer fits on the crib mattress because it shrunk up so much on the first washing and the top sheet also shrunk so it barely goes around the bed. All the sheets are extremely wrinkled when they come out of the dryer as well. Other 200 count cotton sheets that we have purchased for my son have never looked like this.

My favorites (esp. plates 7 and 16) bring out the model's physical strength, not as a weightlifting grotesquerie but as something inherent and womanly.It may seem redundant to say this of nude photos since the subjects are all conspicuously female, but Morey seems to delight in the models' femininity. I don't mean the pink, ineffectual kind, but the features that make women such beautifully different people than men are. This shouldn't be the only collection of nudes on your shelf, but it certainly has its place.-- wiredweird"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant work","review":"I picked up Ghosts of Mississippi several years ago but tucked it away for a rainy day. De la Beckwith's death earlier this week (and a California rain storm) prompted me to dust it off. I now regret not having read it years ago. Maryanne Vollers' work is, in short, a masterpiece. Her amazing investigative skills and craftmanship left me wanting to read more. Logging on today to write this review, I was thrilled to see that Vollers has a new book out (Ice Bound). This time I won't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Pictures!","review":"I enjoyed the book. A well written book of history, however, I was very disappointed that the author put no illustrations in the book. Not even one picture. The cover has a picture of Medgar Evers that is very dark. I would have loved to have seen some trial scenes and pictures of the actual characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok, four and three-quarters stars....","review":"This book is definitely not what you would call fun to read, but it is a stirring and important document. The author commits a few infelicities of language (for which I would have deducted the quarter-star if I could) but keeps the narrative tension high and sheds a lot of light for this Yankee girl on the kind of culture that made a man like Medger Evers loyal to the state of Mississippi even though it was a state that would allow his murderer to go unpunished for decades. It doesn't gloss over the warts of those on the side of the angels, and although it doesn't fully explain the psychology of the assassin, perhaps no one can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I saw and was disappointed by Rob Reiner's film, but and figured that the source material (this book) would be an improvement. I was wrong. Evers' life is inherently dramatic, and his case an important one, but the author does her best to drain the life out of it with cliched writing and obvious, even reductive analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saint","review":"I read this book through, not long before Mr Beckwith passed away in prison. I found this very one sided, Medgar Evers is shown to be a saint, an angel on Earth, while Byron De La Beckwith is shown at EVERY turn to be a warped, crazy person. Anyone hoping for fair reporting here will be out of luck. Remember, Mr Beckwith was tried twice and had a hung jury. It wasn't until the late twentieth century, with the PC climate, that he was found guilty. At that point there was no way he would have been found not guilty."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT&T Model 2300 Expandable Phones","review":"I purchased a base unit and two phones in approx. 1995.We have used the phones successfully and have rubbed off the numbers and letters from the keys.I purchase three hand sets to replace the two well worn handsets.The replacement handsets have display problems. Some vertical and horzontial parts of the display do not display. The cause is the separation of the display panel from the electrical contacts of the screen.I am disappointed that an AT&T; product would have such a major flaw.I will probably disassemble our old handsets and see if I can swap the rubber key pad with the old phones that do not have a display problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Phone","review":"Poor quality unit. That's why AT&T doesn't sell these themselves, but out-sources them instead. Half the time I have a echo in my ear of myself when I use the phone. Now it has developed a \\"Chripping\\" sound that you only hear once you have dialed the number. The person on the other end can't hear you when this happens. Solution is hang up, walk over to base unit, pick base unit up about 4 inches from desk, drop base unit on desk, re-dial the phone number. Of course these undocumented features (problems) began shortly after the warranty had expired."},{"rating":"1","title":"unit is bad","review":"i got TWO (2) full units bc i couldnt find handset at storewas good until..BOTH LCD screens died on BOTH handsetsthe system like a bus marquee made of boxes now half text is missing like if battery died and replacing it didnt fix itall i get is ]-[ = L l 0 example most text is gonei experienced this with organizers when batt dies but ...\\\\also sound is horrible and crackly"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take your money elsewhere!","review":"I purchased this phone with an additional handset last week and it is of extremely poor quality so I have resumed use of my old 900 mhz VTech.

In sum, take your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase This Phone","review":"I'd give it 0 stars if I could. I had the same problem with the phone cutting out as the person from Plainview, NY. See AT&T 2300 2.4 GHz Cordless Phone with Caller ID for the review. I do not have call waiting nor do most of the people I call. AT&T was trying to blame the problem on that, but it must be something else. They sent me a new phone (wrong model) to replace it, but it had the same issue. I sent it back. Later, the original phone was unable to find it's base even though other phones worked fine when plugged into the phone connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"We've had this phone for over a year now and it is hands down the best cordless phone we've had. Quality is excellent, machine is very clear. We bought the Uniden - 2 handset phone first - but every time we put on the microwave while we were on the phone, the unit would get static. No such thing with this unit. It works great. I have 2 handsets and now I'm thinking of buying a couple more for the rest of the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bargain system - except for the Caller ID bug !!","review":"In my search for a cordless phone with the following features, I thought this ATT 2322/2300 was IT.- atleast two handsets - expandable to more.- NO answering system on base.- Caller ID (this was the drawback read below!)- 2.4ghz DSS- Speakerphone on each handset- and most other common features!The Caller ID only displays the 10 digit format from SBC/Ameritech and the phone cannot add a 1 in front - so that I end up dialing local numbers! eg. My local area code 630, CID: 7734421234 - dialing from the phone to this CID results in 7734421 (ie 630-773-4421)! If only there was a provision for adding a 1 in front of CID dialed calls. The Casio Phonemate system I had did have this feature - but the Casio was a horrible system in every other manner!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Battery Life","review":"Good phone! I've been using them for ten years or so. I first bought it, after a consumer magazine review indicated that the headset would go a long time without needing a charge. It definitely works great for battery life, and most other aspects. I've used it with a headset, and it works good there, with no complaints from the person on the other end saying they can't hear me well. It not quite as good with the speaker phone. The only significant downside is the keypad that slowly fails over a few years. You have to press harder and harder to get a given number to dial. It gets noticeable after a year or two. Because of the great battery life, and the low cost of refurbished 2300s, we just buy another refurb when one gets too hard to dial. I read somewhere of a man that wrapped the keyboard area with plastic wrap, and he claimed it prevented the keypad troubles, even under dirty operating conditions. I haven't tried that yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice quality","review":"Works fine. Apparently well-made and sturdy. Amazon requires 14 more words: It is a nice shade of blue and has a pleasing rubbery feel on your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this item if you want a playpen.","review":"This is not a portable product in the way you think of portable. It is sturdy and the bonus is it packs into a carry bag. Folds up or out in seconds and is as sturdy as a non-portable. very large compared to what they sell in the stores about twice the size but not too big to be a hazard.

It seems to be very high quality and it is the only large size playpen available today judging by my Internet research. The baby just loves to play in it and it is very easy to put up and fold down."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Like It","review":"Pros: It is very colorful and infants love the color contrastA safe spot for your baby:) It is fully screened in and the bottom velcros down so your baby will not get his or her fingers caught in between the mat and the pen.It is very sturdy. You do not need to worry if you have a bouncy toddler.Cons: It is heavy!!!! Build up your arm strength and lift it with careThe bag that the playpen fits into is cheaply made :/ We have had problms fitting the mat and the pen into the bag. Also, the zipper is not very rugged so it will probably break fairly easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful .. one of my best buys","review":"I was able to pull this out of the box and put it together and less than a minute. It is very colorful and the toys are very cute. I have a 3 month old that is a little to small to play with them, but she like to lay in there and look around at the toys and the colors. The bottom pad is cushioned but not very much. I think it is soft enough for naps and play time though. My 8 month old played in there last night and scooted his bottom around in there and played with the toys for about an hour. This is a larger playpen that would be hard to move from room to room. IT is 3 feet by 3 feet w/ no wheels on the bottom. I have it set up in the corner of the living room where I will keep it. There is noting about this that I do not like. My only change would be to have a cover that was washable for the bottom, but luckily I do not have a baby that spits up."},{"rating":"2","title":"best playpen ever!","review":"this is one of the best most practical porducts i have bought for my kids. i wish i would have bought it when my first one was born! we took it camping and my son slept in it in our tent trailer, as well as for naps down on the beach. the toys in it allowed him to play while he layed there and then would fall asleep! the square design gives more room to play when he can't be on the ground! just perfect! love it love it love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We still use it at 2.5 years old!","review":"I love this pack n play! The other ones that are rectangular and fancier did not work for us (and they were twice the price).... It was the one with a changing table and bassinet. I finally relented one day and bought this one because it was bigger, boxier and roomier. My son hates restraints and being boxed in, but he is much more okay with this larger pack n play, and is willing to stay in it for 20-30 minutes at a time (a record!). And he is 2.5 now, so it will definitely last longer than the rectangular ones you see everywhere...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well made, great value, and the black option looks great!","review":"Roomy, very well built, easy to set up and break down. Decent padding for a playard.I bought the black colored option ($[...]) because I wanted something more neutral than the primary-colored one, and the pastel version is quite expensive for some reason. It does not have the play toys on the side, but I was looking for open views as well. I also purchased the fitted padded sheet (acts like a mattress pad) and regular green cotton jersey fitted sheet....Looks fabulous and is plenty cushy for napping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Playpen","review":"Most of the play pens I saw at the larger retail stores were small compared to this one. I had to get used to folding it. A bit heavy but my son had a wonderful time and a lot of room to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great play yard","review":"I bought this for my 1 year old daughter mainly so she'd have a place to sleep when we visited my mother-in-law for Thanksgiving. It was a nice size, not too big and not too small. And the bottom was cushioned well enough for my daughter to rest comfortably. We had no problem getting setting it up the first night, but the second night it acted as if it didn't want to set up again. Not sure why but overrall we liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great playpen","review":"I purchased this playard b/c my little girl rolls a lot and the rectangular one she has kept her from being able to move around too much. She's able to move all over the place and play! We also took it on vacation and used it for a bed, no problems there either. She loves all the toys on each side of the playard and she's facinated by the colorful mat, as well.

Most playpens are smaller. This was a god send when we went on vacation. Our little girl was still under 2 years old, too big for the traditional playpen and too little to be sleeping in her own bed. If anyone has slept with a little kid, you know you get kicked from head to toe. This allowed her comfort and us a good night sleep. We had it at the hotel and at the house rental. It was something familiar for her as well.We actually had an older version that was passed down from my older sister. My little girl goes over to a private sitter and she asked me where I got the playpen. I did some research and found this one. She watches several kids and bought this for her own grandkids. A MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"only @ amazon","review":"I tried to buy this product at babies r us and they do not carry it, i also went to walmart and couldn't find it.I thought it was discontinued until I searched it here... and yay success!!I was looking for this product in particular because a friend borrowed me hers, and now it's time to return it so i wanted one exactly the same.My baby loves it, she stays hours playing inside!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pack 'n Play","review":"I love this pack 'n play. It is much larger than most portable playpens and yet breaks down with ease. I just love that it is covered in bright colored fabric rather than the navy and tan colors we see so much of in baby gear. My son just loves it and enjoys fiddling with the attached toys. I am very pleased with my decision to purchase this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains PVC and Fire Retardants!!!!","review":"As soon as I opened the box, I could tell by the VOC's that this playard was treated with chemicals. I called Graco to confirm that it is indeed treated with fire retardants. In addition, some of the characters on the side panels contain vinyl...like the entire face of the sun is PVC. Why would you let your child play, let alone sleep in this toxic chemical stew. I called Joovy about their Room2 Playard. It's the same size but quite a bit more expensive. The representative told me it was not treated with fire retardants. Definitely worth it to pay the extra $, knowing my children won't be exposed to harmful chemicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice","review":"This playpen is huge and real nice.

Also, we were transitioning from the swing and he needed a place to chill out while I make dinner etc. This pen is great. The colors are very stimulating to the baby and he LOVES the rattles, squeakers and crinkles built into the appliques on the sides. He really likes to kick the base to make the noises happen (he is too small to really crawl over and reach). I would have given 5 stars except that the floor does slope in towards the middle, so much so that I would not let the baby sleep in the pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I had been searching for a playpen for awhile. I wanted one with a bottom like I used when I raised my children. It kept them safe and I could put them outside to enjoy the fresh air while I got a few things done. There are lots of pack & plays, but they are too small for play. They have lots of playyards, but I wanted something that would be off the floor/ground. This way it could be used for the inside & outside. I finally decided to try the Graco even though it seemed smaller then I wanted. I was really happy when it arrived. The colors are fun and bright and there is enough room for him to move around and safely play. It is easy to put together and break down. It is also easy to wipe down to keep clean.

The toys built into the sides are really nice too, my son loves them. The only thing I would say is that this is really more for playing in, since the toys might be too distracting to make this a good port-a-crib. Still, it's a great place to stick the baby (or since it's bigger, two or even three of them!) for a while while you make dinner or whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly spacious, portable and fun!","review":"I just bought this to leave at out-of-town relatives house for a place for my one-year old to sleep and play.

We moved it to several different homes and hotel rooms over the course of a week-long trip and took only a few minutes. My son LOVED it - comes with 4 built in toys and the play space is so huge. It actually made me resent the regular playard we keep at home - I may have to upgrade. The one wrinkle is that finding sheets to fit.

It's larger than the other pack and plays out there and much more colorful. The way I see it, a pack and play is place for the baby to explore safely and the combination of the vibrant colors, cute bug toys and mirror on the 4 sides, and padded mat on the bottom make this an ideal location for baby to safely learn about the world.

This product will be used for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect playpen - baby loves it!","review":"the pen is perfect and bigger than the pack n plays with the bassinets. i wanted something to keep my baby safe in while i was busy cooking or doing dishes. he can safely play in this and the toys stitched onto the side mesh keep him occupied even if his toys dont. the only downside is its hard to find playsheets locally. you have to source them on amazon. other than that, its a great playpen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best playard on the market today!!!","review":"Do not hesitate to buy this playard!!!

We use it for quick corralling, not prolonged play time. He likes the toys on the sides, and I like that it is larger than most of the play yards I've seen, granting that my experience is limited.-It goes up and down VERY easily and quickly.-It is not very heavy for the size and sturdiness. My parents have a Cosco playyard that they borrowed from a friend for when we visit. Theirs is about half the size and seems almost as heavy.-The square shape on the TotBloc is nice, too because he can move around a bit in there and actually get somewhere instead of just rolling over once and hitting the end.-There is no listed weight limit on this, only a height limit.

If we kept entertaining her from outside the playyard (like play peekaboo), maybe she would be willing to stay as long as 3 minutes in it.now she's 18 month old, she only spent a total of about 20 minutes in it (after about 10 tries). we gave it away as a gift to a friend.i gave it 2-star because I do feel that it's a well-made product. just be aware not all kids like this. :) it seems most do though based on the review here... not sure why my daughter doesn't (as she likes most of the toys that received good review here)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is really small!","review":"My mom and dad bought this for my little sister. She is 18 months old. It is SO SMALL!!! It is like she is in a cage or something, there is no room for her to move around in it. My mom took it with us to my Gramma's house for Gillian to sleep in, but she kept waking up beacause she didn't have any room. Plus the bottom is really really hard too, so maybe that kept waking her up. My mom and Dad really liked the high sides so Gillian culdn't climb out. My mom and dad said it was way too much money, though and would not tell anyone else to buy it.Bobby, Gillians big brother"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the larger play yards on the market","review":"It can be slightly difficult for one person to set up. Especially if you have a little one in your arms. Otherwise, a very handy item to have. It does fold up to a nice compact size that doesn't take alot of storage space.We mainly use it for naptime when the grandkids are over. The designs on the sides are bright and colorful enough to keep a small one's interest. And they really enjoy the 'noisemaker' parts that they can reach out to rattle and crinkle on their own.We like the fact that it is one of the larger play yards on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playpen review","review":"Love it.

We wanted something bigger than a regular travel play yard so when I am cooking he has a place to play.At first all was well, with in a month the plastic on the corners began to crack and break. He wasn't even pulling himself up yet so this was ridiculous! Emailed graco... NO REPLY... emailed again... NO REPLY... emailed a third time... NO REPLY.This play pen, to me, would be considered unsafe! We have ended up covering the four plastic corners with duct tape b/c of the plastic breaking off in small pieces that are choking hazards. Another draw back ... the cover on the padded bottom does not come off to wash!Definitely would NOT buy this product again... especially since Graco doesn't back up their product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco Pack n Play 36 X 36 square","review":"We abolutely love the size of this pack n play! The extra space is great for older babies to move around and play or sleep. My only complaint is that it does not come with a sheet to cover/protect the pad...and as every parent knows...it CAN get dirty! I have tried to contact Graco and they do not make a sheet to protect it. I was able to find somebody on Ebay who custom makes them and I now LOVE this pack n play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous for sleeping but heavy","review":"We left our hand-me-down pack and play at our parents house. We were going away before we could get it back from them so we quickly ordered a this one. Having watched our first child barely fit in our first one (which was a rectangle) as she grew, we were happy to see how spacious this square version was. It looks like an old fashion play pen. Our second child has PLENTY of room to grow and even at 8 months was taken by all the stuff on the sides. That said, space comes with a price- it weighs about 22lbs. So, we did have to wrestle it through the airport and onto the plane for our trip. But, in the end, would I buy it again? Yes, the space is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!","review":"This playpen is amazing. I bought it for my niece's 4 month old baby. The baby was attracted to all the bright colors. She found the firefly wings and started mushing them.

I am very satisfied with the product and the whole purchase experience. Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"full size playpens rule!","review":"i'm from the old school... the full size playpens were the popular when i had my first child... now all you can find are the compact porta-cribs. the porta-cribs serve their purpose, but they are not for newborns and infants once they start getting active and need more space (albeit, confined space)... i was thrilled when i found the graco play pen, and (as far as portability) we can still take it with us on trips! there's plenty of room for my new baby to play, and stretch out for naps, and just chill! and the little activities on each wall are a positive addition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable Playpen!","review":"This playpen is great! My daughter loves to play in there. She is fascinated with the ladybug that squeaks when you press on it. The sun is a little mirror. The butterfly is a rattle. She even takes naps in her playpen. It's very spacious and covenient to take to the park when we have family picnics. I would definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent play pen; mat needs to be washable","review":"We love this playpen because it's so much roomier than the standard size ones and because it has really fun toys built right into its mesh walls. The only downside is that the very cute mat is only surface-washable, and there are no elasticized sheets available in the market for it, like there are for standard pack n plays.I also wish this pack n play was available in stores and not just online. I think more people would buy it if they could see it displayed in Target and other places alongside all those boring dull-colored pack n plays!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"This is a great place for baby to play. As a square, it provides much more room for baby to move around and play instead of in the rectangular pack n plays.My daughter also loves the animals in the mesh, and plays with them quite a bit.The only thing is that I wish Graco made sheets for the bottom.Overall though, we're very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is a playpen!","review":"I'm an older mom (40+) who did a lot of babysitting as a teen and remembers what big, square playpens used to be like...not the cramped, rectangular things everyone has now. This spacious pack and play is wonderful! Our 10-month-old daughter loves it - we have it in our kitchen so we can set her in it for a few minutes while we use the stove or chop up food (cases where, for obvious reasons, we wouldn't want her underfoot). She can see us, we can talk with her, and she has plenty of room to practice pulling herself up and walking along the edges (and falling on her bum on the padded floor). When she was younger, she loved playing with the attached toys (especially the butterfly with the crinkly wings).It's sturdy, easy to set up and take down, and packs away neatly into its carrying case. An all-around great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Pack 'n Play","review":"I bought this square pack 'n play for my granddaughter.

I have to commend the company for shipping it to us extra fast! We received it only two days after ordering it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where was this when the twins were born????","review":"I have been looking all over for the old time playpen with a lot of room in it for toys and for sleeping when the babies get older. My twins are 9 months old, and before they were born, all you could find was the typical pack n play which was way too small for twins to sleep in, or to play in. We resorted to 2 pack n plays, but then they couldnt play together as they got older. My mom found this one when we went to visit her. She had only one baby bed, and was looking for something besides that tiny pack n play to put the other twin in for sleeping. She was thrilled (as was I) when she found this one on-line. Hooray! Finally something useful for my twins and for single older babies to sleep and play in."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO WORTH IT!","review":"I just got the Graco TotBlock today and I'm already in love with it! The baby was so occupied by the little critters on the 4 sides of the crib and the brightly colored mat that he didnt even need a toy in there with him. I was worried about the mat being hard based off of some of the previous reviews but I actually found it to be quite soft! (not like a bed or anything but soft!) The mesh netting didn't seem too bad either although I'm going to watch my baby when he doesn't ahve socks on just in case he scrapes his skin against it. It's spacious and so easy to set up. I had a little trouble closing it but I think I just need practice. The price is great and hoenstly people you really odn't need all that extra junk that comes with the other ones. The space alone makes this one worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pack 'n play","review":"We bought this pack 'n play to travel to my in-laws house and it was great. It's much bigger than the rectangular one I have at home and it's much easier to put up. It is harder to find the square sheet, but they do carry them at some Toys R Us stores. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a pack 'n play. We are considering buying another one for home to replace our old one-which has only been used several times. My baby also loved the bugs on the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 5 mth old had bleeding toes","review":"Be very careful using this play pen. My baby loves playing without shoes or socks on. He was plaing in the play pen wiggling his legs against the walls of the play pen. Apparently the walls in the play pen are made from a very rough netting and scrubbed the skin off my babies toes. At first I couldn't understand why he had blood on his toes but then we noticed blood lines on the white netting. From now on he is only allowed to play inside when his shoes are on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver!","review":"This is the greatest play yard ever! I bring my son to work with me and we work at a rock crusher so I'm sure you can imagine how dirty the floors can be, needless to say He loves it!!!

Most of all it's very sturdy and will take his jumping up and down.The best item ever.Stoney Ray 6\\\\12\\\\01"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Playard","review":"My child loves this playard. He is fascinated by the animals on the sides. As for assembly it is very easy and fairly intuitive. One person can assemble it (it is just a matter of 4-5 simple steps). For a playard it is light, though my wife always makes me carry it. We take it to various places with great ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spacious!","review":"I purchased this playpen after my sister recommended it. The pros: it is spacious (at 38\\" x 38\\" it is larger than the average pack and play), it is sturdy, it is easy to set up and take down (I did need some help the first time to make sure I was pressing the right buttons to collapse it, but I'm glad they are there to make it more sturdy), and it packs up to a convenient size for travel. The only con I can think of is that the travel bag does not have a handle. I wish it did, but not enough to bump down the star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great playpen!","review":"This is a great playpen. It is exactly as the picture shows, the bottom quilt is comfy and it's quite large and sturdy.

Arrived on time, everything was as promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST PACK N PLAY. VERY BIG","review":"I came across this pack n play in Amazon after searching everywhere for a Pack N Play that would last my baby for at least the first year.Everything I saw at Babies R Us was too small, so I decided to take a chance on this one. I was extremely pleased when I received it.It came already assembled, looks beautiful and is big and very durable. Can't beat that.I hightly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great play yard","review":"I was looking for something for my 7 month old daughter to keep her safe when I need to leave the room.

The pad it comes with is good and the colors and extra toys on the side are fun for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it, baby tolerates it.","review":"I think this playpen is great; it's spacious, sturdy, and colorful. My 10 month old thinks it's a prison. She will tolerate it for about 10-15 minutes at a time, which is fine because it buys me some time where I don't have to worry about her safety. I first introduced her to the playpen when she was about 7 months old. I think she found all of the characters at the bottom to be frightening, but she was fine after I put the sheet on. I'd hoped she'd grow to spend more time in the playpen, but tolerates it less and less as she becomes more mobile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for play, Not for sleep","review":"This is a great for play. I really like the built-in toys and bright colors.However, I bought it for our vacation as a place to play and sleep. Unfortunately, the pad is somewhat uncomfortable and the sheets (must be purchased from company other than Graco) cause the pad to be a little lumpy. My daughter would also wake up and want to play with the toys in the middle of the night and then had a hard time going back to sleep.Although I love the size of it, it is quite awkward to move around when open since it is heavy and large.Still worthy of 4 stars since it does what is says it will do. I am happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco Pack N Play","review":"I bought this for my son to use at my business. It's nice and big to play in, plenty of room.

This playard is perfect. It's larger than the Pack-N-Plays so he has room to move around without feeling constricted. The mattress is comfortable so he can take his naps. I set this up by myself without any problems, so I can assure you setup is a breeze. I did a lot of research before deciding on this playard and I'm so glad I went with this one. Also, the price is affordable. This is a great item, so don't hesitate to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graco Pack 'n Playard","review":"I ordered this product and had it at my doorstep within 4 days. It is a great product for the price. I'm watching my daughter's 10 month old twins and this is a great size for twins to nap in.

My 7 mo. daughter likes to sit in it and plays with the attached toys on the mesh sides along with her other toys for up to 1/2 hr at a time. I am happy with the purchase so far.

The Strawbs are best known for their fusion of progressive rock with folk and the mainstream pop stylings of the 70's. Here we see them at a point of transition, begining to move from their folksy roots gradually into a more 70's progressive sound. Rick Wakeman had been doing some session work with the Strawbs prior to this. This was his official entry as a full time member. His playing is in top form without being completely over the top, and is the centerpiece of more than one track here. This is also a primarily accoustic recording. If you like the Strawbs, this is a must if you wish to have a good scope of their evolution over the years. \\"Song Of a Sad Little Girl\\", \\"Where Is This Dream Of Your Youth?\\", and the live bonus track \\"The Vision Of The Lady Of The Lake\\" are absolutely stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"first strawbs","review":"In 1972, I was looking through my friend Hank's voluminous record collection and came upon this album. I asked him about it and he played a scratched and skipping \\"Where is this dream of your youth?\\" I dug the song right away and I guess that I borrowed the album, though that usually means intent to return. (It was trashed from too much careless play on an old Gerard with a bad needle, so I don't think he wanted it back.) While this is not the most accessible Strawbs issue, it is, to me, the most alive and weirdly unsettling. And the Strawbs are pretty weirdly unsettling on just about everything they do, so that is saying a lot. I like the \\"Where is this dream\\" jam on this record better than the studio version, and Wakeman does his virtuoso trip more effectively on this recording than anywhere else, in my opinion. Try Hero and Heroine or Ghosts if you are new to the Strawbs, but don't forget this oft overlooked gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only i could purchase MVM when I was student...","review":"Very useful book.

Muffin was SWEET, and very well trained. Muffin did many of the tricks explained in this book. You could see he was a very happy dog, which made me buy this book. The author trains with kindness and firmness and that's something that I could have seen from just reading the book without having met her."},{"rating":"2","title":"REAL Dog Book! (It's GREAT)","review":"This book is awesome! It is so clear and easy to follow. It helped us so much with both our dogs. Anyone who says it is cruel to give a dog a correction if it is needed is wrong. Dogs DO have to be corrected. Our two terriers snapped at the kids. We corrected them as the book told (with a smack on the nose) with a riding crop, and they learned not to in just one day. Without this, we would not have been able to keep them. Which is better, correcting a dog or taking him to the vet's to be killed?? This is by far the best book on dog training on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draconian Dog Training 101","review":"This is the book to read if you want to terrorize your dog rather than train it. Included are the gems of hitting an aggressive dog over the head with a hardback book, hitting it with a stick and scolding a dog upon discovering 'spiteful' behavior such as chewing or eliminating while you are gone.The author advocates the use of fear to force the behavior she wants. Her methods are beyond antiquated - they are sadistic and cruel. A truly horrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow - pretty harsh","review":"I couldn't bring myself to use most of the techniques in this book on my puppy. Jerking a dog's neck hard with the leash, throwing water in his face and yanking him off his feet by the neck might sound harsher than they really are, but I simply don't want to do them. There are a few useful tips here, but the techniques that I did attempt just caused my dog to cry and run, and left me feeling absolutely horrible about myself. After reading about more positive techniques from authors like Paul Owens (The Dog Whisperer), I just can't see using any other approach but a positive, non-violent one. In a short time my dog has responded to positive training joyfully and is on her way to being a wonderfully well behaved dog. Most importantly, I love training her as much as she loves learning. Don't ignore your own sense of humanity- it's there for a good reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!","review":"I opened this book and the first recommendation I saw was to smack the dog on its hip (this was for general disobedience, I believe). I turned to another page and saw \\"Hit dog on its nostrils with your palm\\" (this was for failing to \\"stay\\"). I don't care what credentials the author has, I can't condone her methods.Try Woodhouse instead, or \\"21 Days to a Trained Dog.\\" You don't need to hit your dog to train him or her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tittle should be....\\"101 to beat your dog\\"","review":"Yes, this book gives some excellent advice on beating your dog. The methods in this book are extremely out dated and rather harsh. The section on \\"Jumping up on people\\" is extremely alarming, acording to this book you should knee your dog in the chest and hit them over the head with books, if this method doesn't work then you should stomp on the dogs foot. If you knee a dog in the chest you will kill them, they do not have the protection around their organs like we do therefore you could seriously damage and possibly kill your dog using these methods of training. Please don't buy this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great dog primer","review":"When I got my seven year old son a puppy last month, I spent a small fortune on books about dogs as I had never had a dog myself growing up. When I looked at the section on dogs at my local bookstore, I was astonished at the number of titles, but devoted a good two hours to poring through as many of the books as I could. \\"101 Training Tips for Dogs\\" was by far the best organized and most practical. I bought that one and numerous other books on animal training, but have found Ms. Decker's the one that I return to again and again for advice about everything from how to keep a dog healthy to how to break a young dog in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works on my dogs!","review":"We have three dogs in our family--two pitbulls and a cocker spaniel. Kate Decker's \\"101 Tips for Training YOur Dog\\" has become our Bible. Her advice has helped us prevent one dog from chewing up the carpet, another dog from constantly vomiting, and another from barking while we're away (and annoying the neighbors). We've love our animals and feel the author shares that feeling. This book taught us a lot about how dogs behave and how they interact with people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, common-sense advice","review":"\\"101 Training Tips for Your Dog\\" is a comprehensive and authoritative approach to dog care and training. Ms. Decker covers just about everything a dog owner needs to know--everything from how to prevent a pet from chewing up the furniture to what to do in medical emergencies. The book is very user friendly and organized so that information is easy to find. There's a lot of commense sense advice here and I'd recommend this guide to anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to spend reading, but wants as much practical information as possible--but dispensed by someone who clearly loves and cares about animals. I especially liked the photos of the author interacting with an assortment of dogs, most of whom, I'm guessing, belong to the author herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abusive methods","review":"I skimmed this book in a bookstore and it brought tears to my eyes.This book advocates abusive training methods.

There are many better, positive method training book available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Methods that are 30 years out of date","review":"What an appalling book! You should never, ever hit your dog. If your dog has a problem that serious, you should consult a professional trainer -- not listen to a book written by a woman whose training ideas are from the 1950s. These methods could also seriously injure or emotionally traumatize a small or sensitive dog.Hitting, choking and slapping haven't been used by intelligent trainers for decades. There are other, gentler ways (like leash corrections or clicker training) of getting your dog to behave."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdated abusive methods","review":"As a professional trainer running a very large training school, I'm disappointed to see that these outdated and abusive methods are still out there. This writer still recommends hitting dogs, pushing their noses into messes, and she even recommends use of a \\"riding bat\\", which she says is like a riding crop but \\"sturdier\\".The proliferation of positive methods means that nobody should ever again feel they have no option but to hurt their dog and call it dog training. Please read \\"Positive Puppy Training Works\\" by Joel Walton, \\"The Power of Positive Dog Training\\" by Pat Miller, and other excellent books by more positive trainers.

I read it in a day and couldn't put it down! The descriptions of sounds and scents in the world of total darkness will set your imagination on fire and you become as eager for light as the characters are by the end of the story. Its a powerful allegory of Christian salvation and offers an often visceral representation of human falleness; trapped in darkness and evil, totally so if not for a few divine promises of deliverance, yearning for light and mercy, having never known either of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully Written","review":"I recently bought this book having remembered that I read it in High School.

(not!)","review":"I bought two pieces of Delsey Meridian Plus luggage, and both suffered the exact same fate - giant cracks around the wheel mountings after just a couple of international flights. Delsey MUST be aware that there is a HUGE design flaw with this model. It doesn't take an engineer to figure out that you can't use brittle polycarbonate for luggage! The problem is so widespread (I've seen many online reviews citing the same problem) that I almost wonder whether these things are engineered-to-fail. Delsey, shame on you for selling shoddy products. My Samsonite Oyster luggage lasted literally hundreds of times longer than this Delsey junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible book!","review":"This is a book of how NOT to create a logo.

Seriously, there's a whole section on circle logos where he takes circles and does various things to them to make something that doesn't really qualify as a logo.And honestly, the examples are very sloppily done. Things don't align properly, there are gaps and corners poking out where they aren't supposed to. You would think he would go over his \\"designs\\" carefully before publishing them in a book.

While it does provide good instruction on different Photoshop plug-ins to generate design results, the sample logos in this book seem very, very dated. Many of them are not good examples of logos that I would expect to see from a design house.

Hadrian's Wall was built against them, and the Romans never managed to conquer them. They're the original Blue Man Group. The best part of their cultural legacy, IMO, is their sculptural work. The stone carvings that they left behind are intricate and mysterious, ultimately developing into the Celtic form.

However, that's not my real complaint about this book.As with his other book, \\"Sex God,\\" Bell's \\"theology\\" is shallow -- soft on basing anything on Scripture and using more of a \\"touchy-feely Jesus\\" than anything else.

As a result his whole thesis is self referentially incoherent.Rather than saying that there is no such thing as absolute truth, perhaps what Bell is really saying (although he would never put it this way) is that we should believe his truth, rather than classic Orthodox Christian truth.Coupled with this his writing lacks clarity and so at times the reader has to work very hard to understand what he is saying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good...","review":"I read this book on the recommendation of a good friend of mine and I certainly found it worth my time. I appreciate the author's desire to get at the heart of the way of Jesus. I think he does well to walk the reader through Jewish culture/history to add another level of understanding to New Testament accounts that I think many have heard and probably studied.The book is a quick read, honest, real, and seems to do well to give a better understanding of who Jesus is.4 Stars because of its brevity and lack of cohesiveness between chapters. The topics he touches on could very well be expanded upon and made into 2-3 books. Scripture within the text of the book would also greatly improve the value of the book.

After all, isn't a personal relationship with our God kind of the point? If you're looking for your faith in Christ to develop not only linearly, but spatially, this is the book for you.

He has some insight that may anger you, but maybe that's good. He says the Bible has been thrown at us one way for centuries and maybe we've been interpreting things slightly wrong that whole time. Throughout the book, Rob explains that there are many passages of scripture that are being interpreted from a modern-day perspective when they were written in an ancient time for ancient people. He says we've injected our culture into these passages instead of lookng at them from the culture of the Jews in 30AD. And if we look at them in the context of the culture for when they were written, we get very different meanings.

Not all are neutral. Not all strengthen the faith.

This book is theologically confused and seems to be more about trying to be \\"trendy,\\" \\"artsy,\\" or just the newest thing going.

If you have heard Rob this book is so typically Rob Bell.

I have had the fortunate opportunity to attend Mars Hill Bible Church on a couple of occasions, and I was both challenged and encouraged by Mr. Bell each time I went. I enjoy the questions that Mr. Bell puts forth, and I am also challenged by the different thoughts he has on theological topics long considered to be answered or solved.In summary, Mr. Bell's book gave me a lot to think about and to process, all while encouraging me and motivating me to keep digging toward a deeper, lived-out faith. I am thankful for the book and for his insight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent material, poor delivery","review":"I am currently using this book as a Christian devotional.

I haven't yet finished, but have enjoyed filling the margins with personal notes, questions, and Biblical references. He may come off as brash, but I like Bell's work.The packaging for this product was not up to par!

He brings a fresh perspective on subjects that have been preached into the ground.

These books will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Look at the Christian Life","review":"Just as a velvet painting of Elvis gives us another look at Mr. Presley, so also, Rob Bell wants to paint for us an alternative picture of the Christian life. The Trinity is like the spring of a trampoline that helps us to spring up in faith for a better look at what God is like.Bell also has a chapter about being yoked to Jesus and His teaching. We cannot simply \\"make a decision\\" for Christ. We have to yoke ourselves to Him and submit to Him as ourrabbi and also as our true emperor.Bell also says we can be true to God by doing whatever we do in life to His glory.He also has a chapter about the founding of his church and how he got burned out and how he was burning out because he trying too hard to be successful rather than doing his ministry out of adoration for God. He found out during this time he had a soul that needed to be reignited.Bell does a good job of bringing confusing biblical concepts down to earth,and that is the biggest reason why I like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!!","review":"Before I decided to read this book my friends kept telling me, \\"If you're comfortable with your faith, don't read this book,\\" to which I replied, \\"If you're comfortable with your faith then something is wrong.\\" If we don't challenge our faith, then how will we ever develop spiritually?That's exactly what this book is about: challenging and questioning our faith. Bell takes us into the world of questioning ALL THINGS in search of truth. Question yourself, question the church, question your beliefs, question religious principles and doctrines, question culture, and even question the Holy Bible and how we use it.Along with Bell's profound insights and wisdom, he provides an abundant list of commentary, references, resources, and literature to explore certain points more in depth.

Bell is a Pelagian in his understanding of sin and redemption. People will love this book who have no clue about their own depravity and of God's demands of justice. The cross of Christ is meaningless to Bell and his followers.Just take a look at his little talk with the Dahli Lama a few ago. Luther would have had more to say, and would have taken Bell's little [...] out for a serious whipping.Give us a break Bell. This sheep has another Master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Great book. Rob Bell's book focuses on the love and adventure of being a Jesus follower more than focusing on Christian forms and traditions. He gives fresh insight into the adventure of walking, learning, and adapting to the Christian life in a contemporary context. He gives rich reflections on the ways our faith needs to flex, move, grow, adapt, question, and be relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuel cap","review":"I was not happy with this product,the cap lock came apart and had a gas vapor leak,not good for smog checks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Seal Caused Check Engine Light","review":"The overall quality of the cap is 'OK'. The problem is that the seal inside the cap did not work well and caused a check engine light for an fuel / evaporation system leak. I still had the original OEM non-locking cap and swapped it back over. After scanning the car's computer to see what the issue was, I check all of the fuel hoses and other areas and decided to try changing the fuel filler cap back.

It has a 460 ci engine and 410 rear in it (such a lovely combination). I bought this cap because we usually siphon gas from our cars for the lawn mowers, bikes and go-karts. Since I have the biggest tank and easiest to siphon in the family, I bought this cap to protect my investment in gas and the $109 fuel pump. It locks and has a vent for something built into it. The key has to stay inside so it can be opened which is kinda annoying. I'm going to get another for the second tank when I get the pump for it.**UPDATE**I pulled the key out and the whole lock cylinder came out. The sad thing is I used it like 20 times in its whole lifespan. Luckily I was able to get it off my gas tank.

It seems all the good ideas are used up! But Micheal Warden has created a world in which the very sound of Words and language can create or destroy. This is more than just another fairyland of wizards spouting magic words (though Micheal owes an obvious debt to Tolkien). There are deeper themes in this writing. Deeper ideas than I have found in modern authors lately. An enjoyable story, with villains and explosions and beauty and love and all of the things that quicken your pulse, but also plenty for your mind as well. If you like your entertainment to stay with you even after it is over, this is a book for you. You will find yourself thinking about this story over-and-over. I did, for five years! Any now, FINALLY, the second installment \\"Waymaker\\" is available. Trust me, you'll get hooked and have to have both!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I've never been too into fantasy. However, this book caught my attention. I gave it a shot and was glad! If you liked Ted Dekker's Black, White and Red, then you will probably like this as well. I love Ted, but think Mr. Warden has taken a similar theme and created something far better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wholesale, bold-faced plagiarism.","review":"Michael Warden has stolen Stephen R. Donaldson's ideas, re-written them for a Christian audience, and presented them as his own unique and original work. There's really nothing further to say. Any halfway competent lawyer could win a plagiarism suit against Warden.If you care at all about intellectual property rights, avoid paying a cent for this book. Buy a copy of Donaldson's \\"Lord Foul's Bane\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!!","review":"I normally don't read a lot of fantasy, but this book is incredible. It weaves together a world that you will want to visit, people that are real and a sojourner that you wish you knew. It starts present day then sends you into the Inherited Lands and a new world. You won't want to return. I can't wait for book 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an echo","review":"The author claims he didn't consciously rip-off Stephen R. Donaldson's Thomas Covenant series, though every last detail of his world and situation is clearly lifted. Harrumph. For another example of this, go look into the pagan traditions that underlie all the major holidays and other practices of Christianity."},{"rating":"1","title":"An annoyingly promising story","review":"Mr. Warden has come up with an incredible fantasy world and interesting characters. Two \\"must-haves\\" for good fantasy. However, it was torture reading the book. First of all, it seems there was no editor. Major grammatical errors, made-up words (like \\"it became noticeably MOISTER\\"!!!) and repetitive phrases (how many times can you tell us a character moved with grace? And that another character \\"if it was possible\\" moved with more grace????) dominated the book. Again, it was a good story, but I tortured myself getting through the book, skipping whole useless pages at times, only to get to the end to discover the story only just begun. How frustrating! I won't be reading the sequel, not because I don't want to know what happens, but because I can't stand the thought of going through that kind of grammatical pain again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh, imaginative fantasy novel.","review":"I won't elaborate beyond the positive comments of many previous reviewers, as the book's positive aspects have already been expressed. I haven't read any Donaldson, so I can't speak to that topic. If it is that derivative of his work, that would take away from the novel, though I would enjoy it still. All I know is that this novel is a story with a reluctant and damaged hero who goes through a rough learning process. Part of his past has a very adult theme, so therefore I would be reluctant to recommend the book to very young readers.The depth of imagination put into this world is on the Tolkien level and I enjoyed the way the author wove the story together. I also look forward to the next book, as the ending hinted at far greater adventure. A really good novel in the Christian Fantasy genre!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Ride","review":"Michael Warden's novel is an absolute delight, with an other-worldly feel that kept me guessing about the outcome until nearly the very last page. \\"Masterpiece\\" is not too strong a word for this fine novel. A warning: I found the first half a bit confusing and somewhat plodding. But then comes a thoroughly unexpected twist and-wham! Just like a roller coaster down the first dip, the story catapults you into an amazing labyrinthe of twists and turns. Gideon's Dawn is the kind of allegorical tale that will force you to confront hidden secrets and contemplate one's relationship with the future. It will also leave you hungering for the next installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reagan shown in an unfair light","review":"I read most of this book before I just couldn't read any more. I was prepared going into this, that it painted a picture of America that one normally doesn't hear about. However, the author did so in a mannor that led one to believe that America is the worst nation in all the world. He uses the word demonize to describe the acts that the various government agencies and personel carried out. He praises socialism and communism without giving the whole picture involved with the communist agenda. It is my understanding that he believes capitalism to be destroying humanity. Read with caution, knowing that this is a book about a different America.

The songs show all sorts of ups and downs most musicians faced in the 70s both musically and comercially.After seein Hensley live in Ogre, Latvia (some of the songs from this album were played there), I decided to check the album out. I must admit that it's stunning. At times there is a bit too much of everything on the CD (check out the package), but the whole album has a very good feel although being a little sad. The songs on the CD ((This is) Just the Beginning, Okay, I Did It All etc.) are of the highest quality ranging from melodic ballads to strong rockers 970s style). The Last Dance has already been published before but the song has it's way here and is a true gem.

The songs are tributes to these men, and they play their hearts out. Jose Fajardo passed away recently, this was his last recording, he leaves a legacy of over 30 albums to his credit. The ages range from 56 (JP Torres, who arranged and produced) to 83, Cachao and Fajardo but these guys prove they still have the talent that made them famous and play with teenage enthusiasm.

She wastes a lot of paper just by repeating what she has already said before as if trying to convince herself of those statements.

What I found very useful was the sections on hairstyles, accessories, heraldry, and other details you don't usually find elsewhere. That being said, the author often makes assertions that may just be educated guesses--it's hard to tell the hard historical fact from conjecture.

The only song that i don't like is \\"acting up\\" ft/ Lil' fizz which sounds like a Michael Jackson song and lil' fizz spits a weak verse.

This obviously completely defeated the purpose of having a magnetic latch since nothing was holding the device closed anymore. I considered using gorilla glue to fix it, and that might work, but to buy a product and expect to do something like that is stupid.I will compliment how sturdy the case feels though and if it would just stay closed I'm sure it would have kept my cd collection very safe.

The concept was great and the writing was superb. His sophomore effort, however, leaves much to be desired. The story timeline jumps rapidly from one point in time to another a few months away. Apparently, everything that happens in between is insignificant and only needs be recapped. This \\"time-warp\\" effect slows down the pace of the novel in that the reader now has to read a \\"re-cap chapter\\". Also, the overall driving secret of the novel is not really that great. It's been done before. And done and done and done and done and done. Overall, this book is mediocre at best. Richard Steinberg should stick to covert-ops style books like The Gemini Man and The 4 Phase Man. Both of those novels were significantly better than this.

I never gotten more than 150 pages out of one.On the plus side, the print quality is nice.

Unfortunately with this one, you pay for what you get. Before you even think about installing the printer you better make sure you have a USB printer cable, because they don't include one in the box. Also, buying some extra ink right away would be good, since the cartridges you get to start with are less than half full. After you have all the prepwork in you have to go through the tedios process of setting it up \\"exactly\\" as the instructions say or the install will fail (had to do it 5 times). Once it is installed expect constant lockups, failures to print and scan, oh and the extra load time for windows since the software hogs all the system resources during startup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they disable printer sharing ?","review":"The features looked attractive but when I set up my HP PSC1210 I was in for a big surprise. This is only printer that I know that cannot be shared over a network. It will only print with the computer that's attached to it. So if you plan to use it with 2 or 3 computers in your home network forget it. Now that the cartridges have been opened I can't return it!The driver only offers these options: draft/normal/best, portrait/landscape, paper type and size.The absence of a greyscale and multipage options means it will use up a lot more colored ink than you would normally expect.Maybe all these problems are related to the fact that we can't use the 870c series drivers because that would allow saving a lot of ink. All other PSC's can be used by a windows 98 computer using a 870c driver through the network.So this printer is crippled in a few ways. Maybe it's the successor to HP's Appolo printer line."},{"rating":"1","title":"total trash","review":"Set-up disaster. Printer would not align. Graphic images looked double exposed.

I get streaks in all my pictures. I spend a lot of time in Photoshop correcting levels and streaks as well as something that appears to be dust, underneath the glass, that shows up in every scan. In my opinion, your best bet is to buy a printer and buy a scanner. I know the whole all-in-one thing is convenient, but in this case, I feel as if I definitely sacrificed quality for convenience.

However, the big reason we got a new printer was for making labels. Desipte following all of HP's and Avery's instructions, the 1210 is only capable of ruining expensive labels.

The paper feed only seems to work with one sheet; more than that and it grabs multiple at once. The scanning only works for single pieces of paper; anything at all larger that requires the lid not to be pefectly closed and you might as well take a digital photo instead. And don't get me started on the software; I'm a professional developer for a major software company, and it still took me several hours with low-level diagnostic tools to get it all installed correctly and working. All in all, a pretty miserable experience.On the bright side, the printouts come across nicely, so I haven't quite thrown it into the trash yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Convenient","review":"This is a great product. It prints great pictures. The Ink Cartridges have lasted long for me. It is small so it fits in tight spaces. The Scannner is not top of the line, its a 36 bit, but I already have one that is 48 bit which I use to scan, so I don't really need this feauture, but 36 bit scanner is good. What I liked the most is that you can use it as a stand alone copy machine, so you don't need to turn on your computer and scan your documents and then send them to print, and even if you got the copy option in your scanner in order to print it you need the computer to be on, but with this baby it doesn't matter if the computer is one just turn on your 3 in 1 and get your copy in seconds instead of minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, Easy to use, Great quality at this price!","review":"I am very happy to have HP quality for the copy/print functions at this price; tossing in a scan capability at this price is pure bonus.

I like the small footprint of this unit.

As Moss recounts these stories, \\"Falling Woman Creates a World,\\" \\"The Battle of the Twins,\\" and \\"Hiawatha's Mirror\\" are classics among cross-cultural myths and folktales from around the world.Robert Moss writes with energy, passion, and from the depths of his personal experiences. In his writing and teaching, Moss has explored, developed and expanded new ways to apply the spiritual teachings of many different cultures to the practice of dreamwork in contemporary life. DREAMWAYS OF THE IROQUOIS moves Moss's work to a new level of understanding, awareness and synthesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamways a hit","review":"Unlike alot of books on the subject, Robert Moss has again written an interesting book on the subject of dreaming.

For me, the place this shaker leaks is not the measuring jigger lid, it's where the lid fits onto the main body.

I am, however, looking for an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly functional","review":"While not the most singularly elegant shaker, it is highly functional, with a jigger measure in the cap with lines for 1/2 and 1 jigger, plus a 1 ounce measure.

But it arrived scratched up on the widest part, because the packaging provides no protection for mail order. The scotch tape on the package suggests it was a return.The caps are not a good fit, and must be held tight during shaking.The double wall design is great, but the problem is that the lid and cap are single wall.

Disorganized, infused with humor that really isn't that funny, and a lot of excess verbal baggage that I personally don't have time for.I would have preferred a concise, logical text that gets right down to business, moves in linear fashion, and actually gets somewhere quickly.

The fact is that this book discusses EVERY topic related to the world wide web. It gives a broad understanding, plenty of detail, and a lot of wisdom as well. I disagree with folks who suggest it is \`\`out of date''; it still provides the perfect foundation for anybody who is going to build a web site (or wants to know how they work).If you want to use technology that isn't mentioned in this book, go ahead and get another book on that.

Lowdown Grown-up Jive is tongue in cheek yet serious. The musical arrangement is tight, with a beat reminicent of 60's girl bands. Love Stuff showcases Harmans flawless harmonica technique and the title tune wraps up the CD with a blues festival type jam.Too often blues fans expect more of the same from their favorite artists.

It's not terrible, but it is nothing in comparison to some of his other albums such as Extra Napkins, Do Not Disturb, etc. There are few tracks on this CD that deliver that raucous, toe-tappin' roadhouse boogie attitude that we've come to love and expect from James.

I bought mine on the recommendation of someone who has one: he dropped his onto the pavement and into a puddle. His PDA was fine. On the plus side, it is compact. It is padded, but doesn't take up much more room than your PDA (in my case, a Handspring Visor). There is an ID window and one slot inside, as well as a holder for an extra stylus. Some may see the fact that there's no room for anything else as a negative, but I got my Visor to eliminate lugging around address books and notepads, etc. Why confuse the issue? Probably the only negative is the lack of a clip or belt loop or even a strap. But, given the price of other PDA carriers, this is an excellent value for money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Case for Palm VII - NOT!","review":"While this case is listed here as fitting both Palm III and Palm VII organisers, the packaging only mentions the Palm III.

This excellent Palm glove worked well for me until this past weekend when my Palm fell onto a shop floor and the screen was severly cracked. It fell flat on the floor, not even on a corner, which would normally be the most stressfull fall for the Palm. Two things: Firstly: I think Palm computing should look at designing more ruggedness into their products. This will be challenging to do to keep the size the same, but I am sure they will be able to do this!

This product may work for the Palm III which has the hard plastic flip cover but should not be used/sold for the Palm VII."},{"rating":"2","title":"a GREAT purchase...","review":"I read other customer reviews before purchasing this case, and have to say I am even more pleased than I thought I would be! My Palm IIIxe fits perfectly inside, and the velcro attachment and stylus holder both work beautifully. I can open my flip-top without difficulty, and the card holder is quite handy for my driver's license and credit cards. When zipped up, the case does double the size of your palm; however, you can rest assured that it is safe inside and will withstand normal jostling in your purse or coat pocket. The case has a slightly springy feel and is tremendously attractive as well. The price is a bargain... If you have a Palm IIIxe, purchase this case--it is a model of form AND function."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to carry my Palm!","review":"I'm not a surfer dude, but this Body-Glove inspired case is perfect for my PalmIIIxe!

This case does just that. The case is padded and insulated all over, so you will not fear that bumping and dropping the case against hard surfaces would damage your precious investment in a Palm. Moreover, the case allows you to keep the flip cover as an added protection to your screen. The fit, even with the flip cover, is just right. The velcro attachment is also very secure, so you don't have to worry about a Palm crashing to the ground unexpectedly.I usually put my Palm in my coat pocket last winter and spring. Summer posed a problem, but I got around it by attaching a key chain to the zipper and hooking it to my belt strap. It work perfectly, and the zipper enclosure holds up to the stress of the Palm's weight even as I walk fast...Overall, this product is a must-buy as a protection for your investment in Palm"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Palm VII Users!","review":"This case does NOT fit the Pam VII at all.

Buy Two!","review":"I've had it for 2 1/2 years and have dropped my Palm IIIxe numerous times in various conditions (wet, dirty, muddy). It's like a timex, \\"takes a lickin & keeps on tickin\\". I've dropped it so many times that I've knocked the teeth out on the top corner zipper and now the zipper gets off track or hangs up, my palm is still in great shape due to the protection this case has given it. I'm looking for another one and since it's a discontinued item, will probably buy two. Inside storage is good, it holds all I need to operate daily (credit cards, license, business cards & cash).

By that time, the case from Amazon was en route.The case arrived the same day as the Visor and we were thrilled to find that even with the front cover on, the Visor fits perfectly.

It has enough room to hold my pen stylus in the case and an elastic loop to hold a couple of normal stylii.

The left side of the case has a place to hold a Graffiti cheat sheet or a business card and a few other small items (photos, driver's license, c-cards.

I've always loved the Valdemar universe and I had been excited when the \\"pre-history\\" series was coming out. I don't know if it's the influence of her husband as a co-author, but this trilogy is one that I don't think I can bear to read a 3rd time. I only read it twice because I couldn't believe it had been as awful as I'd recalled.The characters in the 3rd story are so hard to care about that it becomes nearly impossible to care about anything happening in this book. The book seemed rushed - almost as if it had been thrown together to complete the trilogy.I'd recommend reading ANY of Ms. Lackey's books before these. I still think she's a wonderful author, but don't let this trilogy be your first experience reading her work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to good.","review":"I feel like Larry Dixon must have written most of this book. This acts like there was one event, and they tried to turn it into a whole book. There is little or nothing about the Black griffon and his mate in this book, and it does not add to the story line. The black griffon was an excellent read, and if you like it, you won't like this book. I think this was the first time I returned/traded off a M.

My advice: get it from the library if you really want to read it. You'll be glad you didn't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Pointless","review":"Although I really liked the fist two books in the Mage Wars trilogy, this was quite disappointing. This story is not at all about the main characters you have come to expect from the first two books, but their troublesome offspring. It is a protracted romp through the woods, with the two main characters being hunted by some unknown force, which of course ends happily and victoriously. No political intrigue as in the first books, but mostly an \\"action\\" read. Lots of accidents, running, fighting and arguing. You do not need a whole lot of brain power to get the story, but a healthy imagination would help, since the whole thing is boring, cliché and predictable. The characters are flat and uninteresting, eliciting no emotional investment or response from the reader, and the whole book in general, felt like a badly written fan-fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first two!!","review":"While many other readers felt that the first two books in this series where more interesting, I beg to differ. If you like wartime strategy, politics and lots of description then you probably would prefer the first two. If, on the other hand you like action and suspense, than this would be of more intrest to you. The characters are fresh and interesting, and though the \\"bad guy\\" was sort of predictible, the story is well written.

It was a new story for me, but still easy to predict the twists and outcomes. If you have read the first two books of the trilogy, this book is a bit of a departure - the protagonists are the children of those in the earlier books. It takes a while for an interest in, and concern for, the characters to develope. This detracts a bit from the opening chapters of the book, but the story is interesting enough to hold attention past that detraction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took to long, not in good shape","review":"It took a little over a month to recive this book.

Vitola strains to perfect \\"cleverness\\" in her characters and plots. She is preoccupied with creating unforgettable characters (in the eye of the beholder),than with the essence of good story-telling. I look for believability in her writing and cannot find any.

However, the amount of time I have to spend going over and over on my skin to get the shaver to pick up the hair is just ridiculous.

I have fine hair that usually comes right off with any half decent product. This \\"shaver\\" is not a decent product. It somehow managed to give me quite painful razor burn on one leg without shaving off any of my hair. I was injured and disappointed. I threw away the packaging before I tried it, but I'd return it if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Remington quality!","review":"I had a Remington for about 15 years. it was a great little razor, then it died. I bought another one a few years ago and it was only ok so I bought this hoping it would be an improvement.......WRONG!This one is horrible! I shave and shave and shave and the hair is still there. It takes forever and when I think I am done I still find big patches that the razor left uncut.I think I will look for another brand and stay away from Remington altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I had a Remington shaver for 11 years before it died, so naturally I replaced it with another Remington.

What has happened to Remington?"},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I'd read these reviews","review":"My teenage daughter dropped & broke the shaver I'd had for 13 years. I thought Remington would be good -- a company known for making razors. Wrong! We've had it for about 3 months. My daughter said it didn't work as well as the old one, but I'd read it takes awhile to get used to. She's used it plenty & asked to use a regular razor, something she's been very afraid to (and still is). I tried it & I see why! It DOES NOT CUT HAIR!! One review said it was because of the trimmer before the foils, but my old one had that & worked wonderfully. I thought \\"they just don't make things like hey used to,\\" but took a chance yesterday & bought a $10 Conair LWD1. What a difference! It works! Remington really messed up with this one, so I'll never buy that brand again! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"This razor is terrible!

It took 5times as long to shave has my normal razor! I had to go over the same areas about 10 times, only to discover later I still had hair there!

No pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"This was so bad I didn't even want to give it one star but I thought I better just so I could express my frustration. I try to be a very positive, optimistic person, but after purchasing two of these razors in the 3 week span and both ending up not working AT ALL, I quit. I went to another brand. I was able to turn my first one in and thought I'd try a second because I thought there is no way this would happen again. But sure enough, after using it about 5 times, I hit that button one morning and nothing. Sorry Remington...never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"This razor takes forever... You have to go over the hair so many times your skin gets irritated and it is painful.

Then I get the second one and the face motor was messed up and it would not give me the CD back. Another $15 to them and $8 for shipping and I get one that works when installed. The CD has to run via the DVD and makes it so you can not read the track number. You have to switch it to radio to change any of the sould settings. and the card reader is in a real bad spot. Also you have to have the remote to do almost all functions. Now I have had it in for about a mouth and the face moves when it wants to.

She received many animals/birds that were displaced because some child or adult took it out of the environment it was supposed to be in, leaving my mother to raise it. She does this work as a volunteer...I wish more people understood that in most cases, it is best to leave things alone that the parent animal will raise the duck/bird/animal and disturbing it is not wise.I didn't get this book because I just read the free preview and it was clear I do not want to buy this book for my kids.

This film delves more deeply into the samurai/ronin/political psyche than any other film I have seen! It is a brutal, violent and at the same time beautiful film. The cinematography is flawless. The music is haunting. I usually don't like narration but the narrator in this film takes your breath away! Everything about this film is powerful. Mifune's portrayal of Niiro is fascinating! His is a dark portrait of a very complex man driven to self-loathing and murder by his own ambition. The story jumps through time at a frantic pace yet the film is so well done that you are never confused. The final confrontation in the snowstorm is incredible! There are two rather talkie scenes but these do not diminish the power of the rest of the film. At the end of two very intense hours we are left wondering what might have happened if the truth had been revealed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one you shouldnt let get away....","review":"I saw this movie a few weeks ago on a Japanese Channel. The writer of this movie really knew what he was doing. The Narration towards the end of the film is so very moving and provoking.Although you may not like it with poor quality sound and video from a VHS... the minute this sucker comes out on DVD is when you should grab it up. I don't want to spoil the plot, so i'll just say this.Note: Don't buy this movie if you're not a fan of old Samurai films. Trust me, you'll hate it. I tried to make my friends watch one of them, and they couldn't get past the fact that the movie is older than they are and is poor quality compared to films today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible video quality.","review":"As for the Animego release on DVD, it's a terrible transfer, perhaps from video tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentiously overcooked","review":"People who think this is a great samurai movie aren't dumb, just deluded. Mifune bought the story for himself, probably thinking he could equal Kurosawa's humanist insight. That's not shameful; but the story ain't that good. The buildup takes forever, and the main plot device is lame beyond belief. Film students will love this, but not real people. This is to samurai cinema as Shane is to Westerns, beautifully produced, over-earnest and bloated, larded with the cliches rather than the vigor of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"This was an absolutely horrible movie.

What did surprise me though was an open box cutting razor left from the factory which nicked me when I reached in to pull out the pieces. Because of those things, I called Amazon.com and they knocked some off the price, so keep that in mind if you experience any of the same issues. The directions weren't terrible but could have been better. The only real positive I have is that the face of the table - the green matting - looks great.

At first I hoped that the bitterness would mellow with a little shelf time, but after year in a cool, dark place the flavor is the same. I consider myself a foodie and I love strong flavors, but this oil's bitterness is just so strong that it overpowers any other qualities.

I read other reviews about a bitter 2008...They're correct, i remember that year too. If you want the oil for the omegas and the polyphenals, you cant do better than this product. I am a little biased also because this family lives and brews here in Sacramento, CA and they are often at the local farmers market with their oil. Sometimes its amazing, sometimes its fair, but I know what I'm getting. In todays market of irradiated, processed, and cooked beyond recognition foods, I'll take a product I can trust.

I've tried quite a few olive oils (from low to high end) in my time and I've grown to like oils with a light grassy flavor with a bit of peppery punch. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Bariani uses unripe olives to make their oils but I found this one to be overly bitter.

I work at home several times a month and I cannot listen in on conference calls or talk to customers on this phone due to the fading in and out (with both handsets).I would try looking at a V-Tech or AT&T before buying this GE model."},{"rating":"1","title":"G.E dual handset","review":"I wanted a dual handset cordless phone and since GE was the cheapest, I went ahead and purchased the phone. The phone was not at all what I expected. There was a constant hissing/clicking noice in the phone itself. The volume on the phone only goes to 4 unlike my other phone.I also noted that the caller id function did not present the numbers in the order that they called--the date/time function didn't work properly. If it was a repeat number it would go back to the oldest date that the person called on. Also when dialing long distance from the caller id, it would not automatically put 1 in front of the number before dialing. Also, the phone is not shoulder-friendly. If purchasing this phone I would indeed purchase a headset to go along with.I eventually returned the phone and was refunded my money. I think I will spend a little extra money in purchasing a product I have long trusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will not get what you ordered!","review":"I ordered this phone and it is not the same phone described!

As stated from other reviews - poor reception, clicking sounds. Confusing Caller Id format. (Not to mention extremely small display window) And after 1 year of gentle use, on one of the handsets, the 1, 2, 3, 4, & 5, buttons no longer functions. What a waste! Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GE 21006ge3 2.4 GHz Dual - Handset","review":"Well pleased with both performance and quality of these phones.Clear audio with good range.Second handset does not require phone jack, nice feature extending primary base/phone. Good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"short battery life and bad reception","review":"I have to agree with everyone else on the reception...i constantly have clicking sounds and 'white noise.' If an appliance is on (such as the microwave), the noise is unbearable. Also, I usually have to pick up the other handset after 30-40mins of a conversation because the low battery signal will start beeping in. Very, very annoying. My husband and I have had this phone for 2 years and if we didn't have cell phones we probably would have thrown this phone out the window a long time ago. This is the worst phone I have every owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a recommendation","review":"This phone has absolutely terrible reception. There is a constant \\"white noise\\" in the background and a profound click that happens every 30 seconds. I have not had one conversation on either of the handsets without having to ask the other person to repeat what they have said because of this click.Another severe disappointment is the caller id. The calls are not listed in received order. I have yet to figure out the order they are displayed, but there is no way to tell what the most recent call is without scrutinizing the date on the call.The last disappointing aspect I am reporting is that on the caller id display, any call outsite of your area code is not displayed with the preceding 1 (for long distance). This means you may not simply hit the talk button to call back the caller on caller id. You have to punch in the number with the preceding 1+...There is no redeming feature on this phone to make it a worth while buy for any reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst phones I've seen in a while","review":"Bought this set to replace 2 Panasonic cordless phones I had that for some reason have no battery life, even with new batteries...but that's a whole other story.The features sounded great...ability to transfer calls from one handset to another, walkie-talkie type feature that would function even when the power is out, hold button. But I never got to try them out. These phones had the worst reception. For example...if I was in my kitchen with the exhaust fan above the stove on, I couldn't hear the person I was talking to. Even if I was in the living room sitting next to the base, the reception was horrid...static, volume changes. Even the loudest volume setting was no help.The one thing I did like about it...the color combination. The green and grey was very pretty.Needless to say, I returned it to Target yesterday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone, reception, battery life, etc.","review":"I have had a great experience with these two phones after several trials with a variety of others. I am not wild about the color scheme (aqua green and gray - how exicting!) Also, not specifically high tech looking, but works great. Super range on these, the only drawback being that the directory in the phone is a little more limited on the number of spaces per entry, but I have a third party LD service that requires a lot of numbers, so probably not a factor for most. Overall, would most deifinitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Impressed by this Book","review":"I was hoping for something new and different, but this is the same old recycled stuff we've been hearing for years.

Billy Joel has written a series of gorgeous piano instrumentals ranging from ponderous nocturne-like impressionistic works to sprightly and lighthearted rhapsodic romps. No schlock here. All very fine original works and following in the vein of some of the finest piano composers who have come before from Chopin, Debussy, Rachmaninoff and Gershwin. Brilliantly interpreted and rendered by Richard Joo, a master who can play fiercely and with great pathos but who can also trail off and play with the most delicate and subtle touch you might ever hear from a contemporary performer. Joo is more than a technician. He is not just rendering \\"notes\\". No, you can tell he loves these beautiful works by Joel and expresses them with great feeling.Note to Billy Joel and Richard Joo: Please give us much more of this kind of material!!A must to add to your classical collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice stuff, why complain","review":"I like this album whether or not it deserves to fit into the \\"classical\\" music category. From a serious classical fans point of view, I suppose it has flaws, influenced strongly by former classical greats, but so what, that's how it's done. Few artist create without some influence of their culture and surrounding, both past and present.If we were musical critics back in the 1700 & 1800's, I'm sure there were plenty of people criticisng Chopin's latest release or Mozart's current opera.Maybe there's an expectation that a pop artist of this era should stick to his own music, which is wrong.

Fantasies and Delusions is disappointing in that nothing on it actually goes anywhere. You could basically \\"drop the needle\\" anywhere on it and have no idea how it differs from anything else on it. The style reminds me more of a nondescript player piano. Joel is one for whom melodies and interesting ideas have always come easy, but perhaps his hiatus from his strength of creating great rock, pop, and ballads has dulled his abilities.

But this is an insult to Billy Joel's intelligence. What was he thinking? This album is slow, boring, and uninteresting. There is no life to it. It's obvious that a man like Billy Joel needed a break after all those years of good music. He has proven that he really was tired with this CD. He should take a long vacation and return with another... CD like River of Dreams or Storm Front. Personally, I don't think Billy Joel and classical music go together. My recommendations would be don't buy it. You'd be wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get real!","review":"I have another way of looking at this.If this music was actually written by Schumann and the other masters which are unmistakably being emulated within, nobody would give any of these pieces a second listen and they would have been discarded from the repertoire long before the rest of their very substantive works made it even to first base. Fantasies and delusions seems to suggest that Schumann et al had a really, really bad hair day.Unlike other superstar pop writters like Paul McCartney or Yanni who try to emulate the aura of the \\"classical\\" style in a generally nondescript free floating fashion, the thing about Joel is that the mimicry is just plain old way TOO contrived it becomes TOO obvious.

Doesn't Billy Joel (TM - yes he has actually trademarked his name) have any honest-to-goodness friends who could have stopped this?

Pieces move abruptly from locale to locale, from \\"inspired by Debussy\\" to \\"indebted to Chopin\\" to I guess every piece William Joel remembers practicing. Unless you think \\"classical\\" means \\"not a song\\" the only classical thing about the CD for me was the cover which, gee, looks just like a Schirmer book. This stuff was written by \\"William Joel.\\" If you like Billy Joel, buy stuff written by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like classical music","review":"Perhaps Billy Joel's regular fans will listen to this album and think that they've gotten all long-haired (in the classical sense) and sophisticated. After all, it sounds like classical music. It even looks like classical music. Okay, the Boosey and Hawkes parody cover IS clever. But it will invite comparison to real classical composers, like Chopin, and it's going to come up short. Way short.If it causes someone that's never heard any to listen to classical music, then it won't be a complete waste of whatever they make CD's out of. But the aptly titled \\"Fantasies & Delusions\\" (accent on the Delusions) is to classical music what Cats is to Broadway or Ronstadt is to Sarah Vaughn. Don't waste your money, buy some Chopin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wide range of reviews, which should you believe?","review":"After listening to Fantasies and Delusions, I decided to read through the customer reviews and I find the trend to ignore musical history very troubling. I feel a few posters did hit the nail on the head when they revealed that Mr Joel depends far too much on musical anachronism in these very disjointed sketchy works, but it is far more troubling seeing the number of people who go out of their way to praise him for doing this.Maybe you can favorably compare Billy Joel to Yanni because similarly he created pleasant sounding little nothings but I get the impression almost everyone is trying to endow him with the qualities of Beethoven or Schubert, a big joke in itself.No other would be immortal artist ever got a free pass. We shouldn't expect Billy Joel to get one either. And please don't be mad at me, I'm not being harsh, I'm just being fair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"This CD of solo piano compositions by pop singer and songwriter Billy Joel is unbelievably bad. A horrid mish-mash of ultra-romantic piano idioms, including a few naked thefts from works by Chopin, Schumann, Liszt, and Rachmaninoff. I gather that it is what Joel thinks classical music \\"ought to sound like\\", or some such thing. I cannot fathom why Sony Classical would permit this drivel to be released, or why Schirmer publishing company would allow them to use their time-honored sheet-music cover design for this nonsense. Avoid! If you want some classical piano music, get the real thing, not this cotton-candy substitute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good but one question","review":"I've often known Billy could write solo piano material. There is a snipit of this type of material in a tune called \\"Lullaby\\", and after the verses. the middle part of which I believe was an incredible melodic interlude. These compositions are original, fresh, melodic...very good pieces of music.....BUT, please can someone tell me why Billy did not play them?.....He is an excellent player in his own right and probably no reason he could have not performed them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Standard Landscaper Reference","review":"This work is valuable no matter the edition you get. The basic working fact in the business is that most of your needs will be covered by the original edition. The latest edition is expanded and includes more water management and xeriscape coverage.

The book empowers victims of verbal abuse to confront abusers strategically and without the use of similar abusive tactics. Moreover, the book provides a blue-print for employers and managers searching for policies and protocols that can help stop and prevent abusive language in the workplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"1955 all over again!!","review":"You Can't Talk to Me That Way!: Stopping Toxic Language In The Workplace\\" is one of the worst books I have ever read.

Why not just bring the good 'ol boys and hold board meetings in the men's bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"(This guy is like a machine - it seems like a new Pizzarelli CD is always coming out!)So it's yet another solid release from the hip jazz guitarist singer. This time though, he's doing the bossa nova.It seems strange that Pizzarelli's never done this genre before, because it works out so well. He's the perfect laid-back mellow guy for the music.So, as usual, another solid cd beginning to end. Actually, this album is one of his more enjoyable ones because of the new style and great source material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please give me a break !","review":"John Pizzarelli's voice is as annoying as the sound of a dentist's drill.It it so nasal and thin ! This Bossa Nova cd is ridiculous.No amount of masterful drumming from the great Paulo Braga can make up for the horrible lack of swing in Pizzarelli's guitar playing.He has no clue about Brazilian music and rhythm and I am sure that Brazilians must find this recording if not offensive, laughable and diminishing to the sensual and harmonically rich tradition which is called Bossa Nova. Please John, get out of your corny suit and loosen up your act. Also, please, remain with the music of your father. You might be better suited for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"an error gone bye","review":"Seriously, this is an era gone by.21 albums?How about a 21 gun salute!I just personally find it completely boring,like any lounge music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant elevator music","review":"First let me say that I am a big fan of J.P. I've met and spoken with him, seen him perform live on a number of occasions and own most of his recorded work. This CD is a big waste of his talent. He's never been the greatest vocalist but his choice of material, arrangements and trio playing usually compensate. This CD relies on pop versions of several classic bossas. His take on \\"Your smiling face\\" with strings is about as pop as you can get without sitting in a dentist's office. If you liked Sergio Mendes and Brazil '66 you'll like this CD. Otherwise don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Kenny Gee played guitar ...","review":"He'd sound like John Pizzarelli.My 78 year old uncle heard Pizzarelli do a 'Brazilian' bossa nova jazz concert in Salt Lake City and thought that I would like this album.

Three times the doors on the Havahart Mouse Trap failed to latch properly, so each time he got away. On the third try, I actually had my hands on the trap, but I wasn't fast enough to push the latches (little metal rods) down into the catches.I give this product E- for effort, that's almost an F for failure.Only buy this if you have a heart, and are low on brains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing !","review":"Within 1 hour of using this trap with dry oatmeal I had caught a mouse that was making surprise appearances in my kitchen leaving his calling card ! I set the trap (it takes some figuring before getting it to work correctly) turned off the lights at midnight and by 1 Am I heard the cage rattling! Brought the mouse to a fieldand set him free. Cannot recommend this humane trap enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Trap","review":"This trap did the job quickly, neatly, and humanely. I used a Hershey's peppermint white chocolate kiss on the little bait tray. In ten minutes I had our mouse.Instructions that come with the trap are so-so, but I understand why. It's hard to explain. If you make sure the bait tray is level, then you'll see how the two long outside rods (which hold open the doors) balance with the little rod from the tray. The end of one long rod (the curved one I think. My trap is burried behind cans and I'm too lazy to go look.) balances both the other long rod and the short rod from the tray. On top, make sure your bars are laying such that when the doors fall, the bars fall with them, latching the doors shut.I noted on other traps that there is the potential to harm the mouse if the trap is set up wrong. On this one the worst that can happen is your mouse gets away if you don't set it up correctly.The other good things to note about this trap are that it is not messy and it is reusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Current version poorly manufactured","review":"I have had & used 3 various Havahart traps with great success in the past. My mouse trap finally needed to be replaced, so I readily purchased another Havahart. I am disappointed to report that the current quality and trip lever design is poor. The 'flip wires' will not smoothly or completely close (the doors arrived out-of-shape), so even if you could set the trap, the mouse would be able to slip out under the door. Too bad. I'm purchasing other humane traps to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE! POOR QUALITY! NO SOUND in some players!","review":"Bought this classic film to add to my 2000+ collection.

His treatment of Sculpture is especially and mind-bogglingly poor, as he flails around the various sections tweaking but never elucidating the mutually-entangled parameters and punching his keyboard. The most he can say for most aspects of most instruments is that they're \\"really powerful\\" or \\"really cool,\\" but he gives not a clue about how the sounds might be used together to make something coherent.Effective teaching this is definitely not.

Apart from getting some pretty slick songs and putting them together in a nice neat package, he is the worst person in the music industry (even below Max Martin, and I hate Max Martin...). I don't understand why he has to shout his name at the beginning of the song. Anyone who has heard and of the rare songs he seems to get will not tell you that they really love the part when he shouts out his name at the beginning of the song. an even better question would be what the F@#K he says at the end (my cousin an i debate that it is either him saying 'ENOUGH!ENOUGH!ENOUGH!' or 'BLAH!BLAH!BLAH!').

It's some of the best artists in the game, coming together to make hot tracks. Big Pun, Cam'Ron, Canibus and Nore are a great combination. Also, Nas, Jay-Z, Memphis Bleek, Mobb Deep and Flipmode Squad put down fire on the album too. Not every song is great, but it's hard to come out with a 20 plus track CD and make it all good.Overall this is some of the best rap that was out in 98. its still hot nowadays too. if youre a fan of the whole DJ thing and like big posse cuts then this album is for you, as well as all clue's other stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"DJ CLUE THE PROFESSIONAL!

DJ Clue is one of them. He has claimed that he was never into scratching, just the blending of R&B and rap. That statement is right up there with Puff Daddy's \\"I'm not a rapper, I'm an entertainer.\\" quote. On this album, all we here from Clue are tired beats and annoying shout outs. The beats are nothing innovative, just some old song or sample put over a drum track. Little or no scratching is heard. Perhaps due to his lack of skills on the turntable, Clue has a guest MC or crew on every track. We have to suffer through weak rhymes by overrated talents such as DMX, Cam'ron, Mase, Missy Elliot, etc. DJ Shadow has successfully pulled off blending samples unlike DJ Clue who drops boring beats. Thankfully, there are real turntalbists such as Rob Swift, Mista Sinista, DJ Shadow, etc. While some of the beats are catchy, they don't save this album from its many flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Cd was phat to death .","review":"This CD was phat to death and had all the dope artists .

It'll tell you ie. 3 new calls, but if they've called you in the past, you have to scroll thru all the phone numbers and look at dates & times that people called. THIS IS HORRIBLE! What takes 2 seconds on most phones takes you several minutes to do with this phone. I want to know who the new calls are right NOW, not in 10 minutes after tremendous eye stress trying to scroll thru 50 numbers to see who was a new caller.2.

The majority of Dr Newman's examples, which make up at least 90% of the book, are far too harsh to be of any use. If you want to alientate your friends and realtives, be mean to your kids, and get fired from your job, then go ahead and say this stuff to them.

Do it yourself\\"If you are comfortable with harshly telling people no, even relishing shooting people down (and the tone of the book is pretty resentful), I doubt you need any assertiveness training to begin with.For someone who does need more assertiveness, the examples are a little too rude, so this book is too out of character and not much help.

There is very little here musically. I'm a bassist - and I admit that Victor is a virtuoso on the bass - but how long can you listen to someone slapping at 100 miles per hour? It gets boring real quick. One bright spot is Marcus Miller. He joins Victor on one track and he still has it all in my opinion - funk, substance, intelligent musical expression. This CD is chock-full-o simple chords, corney crowd chatter, and moronic dialogue between musicians. No lie, one song repeats \\"What did he say\\" over and over for 5 minutes while they hang on one chord. Come on Victor!

There is way to many special guest at times, and all of the chatter on stage during sounds gets very annoying. I expected only Victor and a bass guitar, true, there are a few songs where it's just him, but then the rest of the group ruins it.

Apparently, (this is never explained in the story) Lords' character was one of Skinner's victims who managed to escape before he finished the dirty deed. She has nasty scars on her arm and leg and has to inject herself with something, presumably to ease the pain.

An amazing performance from Raimi, who slides deftly among the layers of the psychopathic title character without once overplaying his hand in a truly chilling performance. Ricki Lake is also subtle and effective as the unhappy landlady with a slowly growing attraction for her strange boarder. Unfortuately, the high-caliber performances are wasted on a meandering script and unfocused direction -- and a fatally slow pace which destroys any interest we might have in what's going on. As for the gore, it isn't that it's too much, it's that it's not enough. Too little and too late, it's almost half-an-hour before we know anything more about the movie than what we read on the box, and by then we're no longer interested.

I thought the plot had been fine but it needed more work. I believe the story was much too short in order to fully go into the plot enough. I saw several scenes that annoyed me in how horribly edited they were and vital parts of speech, that would have better filled out the characters, cut out. Something good I can say about this is that the acting was interesting fake when it came to Ricki Lake, but I was impressed by Ted Raimi's call on the classic homicidal manic. To tell you the truth I think you should pay close attention to the relationship between Traci Lord's character of Heidi and Raimi's character of Dennis. It all comes down to them. Bottom line, this is a wacko against humanity movie and at some points you actually feel pity for the insane murderer. I would recommended this as a great movie to study, if only for a short while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This film is truely terrible.

The added bonus is the occasional sarcastic remarks by Paul Sherman which makes one laugh all over. From the very first it grips the reader and keeps churning out unexpected twists in the plot,the main element being Maclean's trademark:- Suspense. It keeps the reader rivetted upto the last page and the action never dies even when the suspense has been revealed.

Instantly, u love the quirky hooks and catchy melodies that are both riveting and addictive. Hailing from the the Neue Deutsche Welle or 'New German Wave', Wir sind Helden or \\"We are heroes\\" are a quartet consisting of lead vocalist and guitarist Judith Holofernes, Pola Roy at drums, bassist Mark Tavassol and keyboardist Jean-Michel Tourette. Four singles are released from the album sofar and all are gems, namely \\"Nur ein Wort\\", \\"Gekommen um zu bleiben\\", \\"Von hier an blind\\" and \\"Wenn es passiert\\". My personal favourite is \\"Nur ein Wort\\" - a cheery upbeat song, very folksy sound coupled with a feet tapping beat. Their sound is very analog, unlike the deluge of digitalised music we hear nowadays. This album is quickly a personal Top 5 album for 2005."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ich liebe diese Band!","review":"Wir Sind Helden is my favorite band. I love their music. I actually heard this album live in Stuttgart, Germany while I was studying there before I got the CD. It was quite a moving experience. The song Von Hier an Blind (From Here on Blind) does so much to express the feelings of the the current generation. One doesn't have to philosophize about the future of Germany to enjoy this album though. Some of my friends have critized the Helden for being less critical of society in this CD than their last one, Die Reklamation, which is certainly also an awesome album. However, I think the criticism that they have \\"gone soft\\" since they have become successful is unfounded. Listen for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool, quirky German pop-rock","review":"Music is always a great companion to have when learning a foreign language, be it on account of the inspiration it provides, the pairing of texts with memorable melodies, or the exposure to the rhythm of speech. I am so grateful to have come across this off-beat German band with awesome tunes and intelligent lyrics. A very well crafted pop-rock album that is at times serious and emotional, at others funny and light-hearted. There isn't a song that I don't like. 5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ein gutes Band!!!!","review":"This is one of the best german bands, along with Nena.

I've been on an Alaskan cruise, and will be going on a Mediterranean cruise next summer, and NOT staying in a suite.I found it to be amusing (but not laugh out loud funny) but not particularly helpful.

Its a completely different take on the classic Christmas movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoopi Wipes Out","review":"This movie is but a shadow of what her other movies have been. Whoopi can do incredible movies and she can do horrible movies that are some how guilty pleasures. But this was just terrible. The problem is that we spend what feels like 4 hours building up to an ending that falls flat and drags out.The movie has a great idea: Santa Claus must retire and be replaced - BY WHOOPI!! Great, wonderful, let me see that. We needed a movie that sees Whoopi as Santa Claus almost immediately. The cute Scrooge moments could have happened as she saw the North Pole and had to deliver gifts. But no, Whoopi is Santa for all of ten minutes, and by that point I was bored out of my mind and ready to go. This was clearly just a paycheck for Whoopi."},{"rating":"2","title":"gets u in the holiday spirt","review":"this was a great movie it realy gets you in the true spirt of christmas. a must see for the whole family to get into the spirt of christmas, was very fun to watch. makes you warm all over a feel good kinda show"},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic?

Not a convincing Santa Claus at all and the idea of him turning to Whoopi Goldberg to become the next Santa was a pathetic idea at best. I mean, Kris Kringle has nothing better to do in the run-up to Christmas than associate himself with a money-grubbing home-shopping network??? Give me \\"Miracle on 34th St\\", \\"A Christmas Story\\", or \\"The Polar Express\\" anyday over this. In fact, I didn't even see \\"Call Me Claus\\" broadcast on ANY station this year.

I was so excited to find this item because we love Laurie's music. However, this video is terrible. It looks like it was made in someone's garage and the sound is aweful. I wouldn't even try to sell it or give it to someone, I just threw it out. I didn't want to give it even one star, but I had to. A total waste of money. The CD's are much better. The new DVD, We Are The Laurie Berkner Band was a big disappointment also. It was very lame and not many songs either. Her videos on Noggin are much better. Really, don't waste your money, just record her on Noggin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I love Laurie Berkner and have thoroughly enjoyed what I've seen of her on Noggin.

We have the CDs in the car so we can play whenever he's cranky and, almost immediatly, he's back being a happy kid. So I bought this tape hoping to give him the same experience of music and dancing. To my surprise, not only the video production is poor, boring, sooo null compared to the vivid, bright colored videos from Noggin; but also the audio quality was terrible. I bought this tape from Amazon and you cannot return video tapes after opening them :[ If I had a glance of the content of this video before buying it, I wouldn't have wasted my time and money on it. I wonder how come Laurie have not recorded a new DVD... she's missing a great opportunity here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable!","review":"My son LOVES Laurie Berkner videos on Noggin. This is NOTHING like it. It's not enjoyable at all. The sound is terrible. It crackles and buzzes on all VCR's I have tried. The picture quality is horrible as well. Horrible. Wish I could have given it zero stars ... and get my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"We love Laurie but this video is awful!","review":"We bought this video because we love watching Laurie on NOGGIN. These are NOT the same videos! This is a video of a \\"live concert\\" at what looks to be a birthday party. The sound isn't very good, the animation is just plain bad and my 1 y/o is not interested in it at all. If she hears the \\"move to the music\\" intro on NOGGIN she will run in to the living room and dance around while watching the Laurie videos. She walks away from this tape.Don't waste your money folks, just tape them off NOGGIN like we did and buy the CDs. Your child will be happier and so will your pocketbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"How dissappointing! Absolutely terrible video quality, very poor sound track with lots of buzzing. It appeared to me as though the tape was a thrice over copy used as a master which severely degraded the picture and sound. I was unable to clear up the picture or the sound by adjusting tracking and I have a brand new, high end VCR/DVD combo unit. This tape looks to have been shot in a high school lunch room and the production quality only supports this opinion. Overall, we viewed this tape once after opening the box and threw it out afterwards because it was of such poor quality all around we considered it useless and a waste of money. I would have better spent my time pirating her videos off of NOGGIN for my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"addicting for the kids","review":"We got this video because our kids love her music. Yes, it's obvious that this was filmed years ago. It's nothing fancy as for the graphics or special effects ... but the kids certainly don't notice that. We're looking forward to another Laurie video being released in 2005. I'm sure there will be many improvements (especially the outfits!)But the songs will still be fun and entertaining!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Video Songbook Good, but for Noggin-Style Videos try the \\"We Are the Laurie Berkner Band\\" DVD","review":"We've had Laurie's Video Songbook since it came out, and it's a cute video of concert style performances surrounded by a songbook.But if parents are looking for videos like the ones on Noggin I strongly recommend \\"We Are the Laurie Berkner Band.\\" It just came out on Valentines Day (2006), and is really really good! They really did a good job of picking Laurie's best songs and making cute, simple videos to them that are a lot like what we've been watching on Noggin. The whole band is very expressive and my kids loved that there were other kids dancing in the videos. Plus there's a new song that old and new fans will appreciate. And the DVD format lets parents pick and choose videos (not that we find ourselves skipping any) and watch bonus material like learning the choreography to \\"Moon Moon.\\" \\"We Are the Laurie Berkner Band\\" was a great buy that we will watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slam Dunk Winner!!","review":"Laurie Berkner is awesome. Every song but one is a gem, and that one would probably be liked by others.\\"We do our very best, we do our very best, we do our very best each day, but we're not perfect\\" are the kind of affirmations that Berkner sets to catchy tunes with nice harmonies kicked in for good measure.In Victor Vito, you can hear it a hundred times and not want to blow your head off!! That's good because you WILL hear it at LEAST that many.This was my first Berkner buy and the book is on the way. I'm getting more CDs too! She's first rate, and thank God my son likes her better than Raffi or the Wiggles!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Timmy may be different, but that is not wrong","review":"This book is told from the point of view of a typical child looking at a special needs child. Though a young child might really ask what's wrong with someone, the question as the title implies that there is something wrong with Timmy. That people who are different are somehow \\"wrong\\" is not the best message to offer children to foster acceptance of differences. We can be different and differently abled without something being \\"wrong.\\" A better choice is \\"All Kinds of Friends, Even Green\\" by Ellen Sinisi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"This book teaches other kids a lesson.The lesson is that people shouldnt make fun of kids that are different.I almost cryed when I read this book.My mom read it to me it was very good.My friend was spending the night then my mom called us in because she wanted to read this book to me.My mom was in tears when it was over.This book is good for your kids to read they will love this book so much they will want to read it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Book","review":"I truly appreciated the handling of such a sensitive topic. (...)The characters are wonderful as well and easy to identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO RELIGIOUS.","review":"The publisher should mention the heavily religious tone of this book ... I got this for my sons' school because it sounded good and valuable, but many schools do not accept children's books that mention God in them over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Wrong with Timmy?","review":"Where did the author get her information? It is disturbing that such a popular book teaches outdated and unrefined language to described a child with learning disabilities. As a special ed teacher and counselor, I find it a setback to use language such as \\"retarded\\" in a book which attempts to aid children's learning about other challenged individuals. The fact that there are no credentials to back the author's writing is apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"not specific","review":"this might be a good way of introducing handicaps to children, however the book has no minorities, and there are no specific handicaps explained. i found it hard to read with too much text and it wasn't very good explaining \\"what was wrong with timmy\\" i would chose something else to teach children about handicaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with the author?","review":"This book is a real nightmare for children with disabilities. Maria Shriver does attempt to impart the message that nothing is wrong at all- unfortunately, she's already planted the seed in the young minds of her readers with the mere title of the book. She then spends an exhaustive twenty pages trying to be sure she'd convinced them of it. I'd recommend \\"Russ and the Almost Perfect Day\\" by Janet Elizabeth Rickert instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"GREAT\\"","review":"I just happen to see this on amazon and read the other reviews of it. Since I like musicals I thought why not? I really liked it, just like the others did, what I thought was really interesting is, I just happened to stumble across this and never heard of it. When I did get it and played it, I was impressed it does have some really nice things in it but, what made it interesting was all of a sudden I heard that the show is opening off broadway (its opened-now in previews) that came as a really surpise to me. I'm now looking forward to reading the reviews and hope to see it. I also think its funny that we will have two musicals about frankenstein in N.Y. at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claude-Michel Schonberg and Alain Boublil should sue...","review":"The only reason this has two stars from me is because I haven't seen the production of Frankenstien itself and really do like the idea of a musical. However, has anyone else noticed that the creative team has pretty much ripped off every chord from the Broadway production of Les Miserables? Examples:Birth of my Creation- Who Am ISorrow Born of Dreams- One Day MoreDear Victor- In My Life meets A Heart Full of LoveAmen- Dog Eats Dog and Javert's ThemeThe Modern Prometheus- What Have I DoneThe Coming of The Dawn- One Day More meets Empty Chairs at Empty TablesWhy?- Javert's SuicideThe Chase- Look Down (reprise)The Proposition- The Barricades (\\"You on the barriciade listen to this\\" through \\"Damn their warnings damn their lies!\\")Try singing these songs to the medley provided on the website. Or, better yet, listen to the two recordings simultaneously. There may be subliminal satanic messages being projected from the speakers.A good day to you all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I'm always looking to discover new musicals so when I read the good reviews of this I was definately intersted. Add to that I am a fan of several of the vocalists on this album and I was really looking foreward to listening.I won't say this is comepletely worthless. \\"The Workings of the Heart\\" is a lovely song, and \\"Why\\" has it's moments. Shuler Hensley, Ivan Rutherford, and Rita Harvey sound good in their roles. But I didn't feel that was worth the price of the CD.Other reviewers compare this to Jekyll and Hyde. That can be a good thing and a bad thing. While J&H; is undeniably entertaining it holds little in the way of origonality or musical value. Each song is derivitive of another, better song. Frankenstein a poor man's version of Jekyll and Hyde. It lacks the lovely ballads and occasional dramatic tension that make J&H; fun but it attempts to recreate them. The result is a watered down version of something that wasn't all that great to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't like it","review":"This CD just didn't do it for me, perhaps unfairly. If you've listened to \\"Jekyll & Hyde\\" this seemed like a pale shadow of that, both music and story-wise. I couldn't help but compare the very similar plot-line and the much less engaging but similar songs. The singers, too, I thought were also lacking with the exception of Shuler Hensley (who was great as Jud in the 1998 London cast recording of Oklahoma.) Despite the reasonable price and mostly glowing reviews which lead me to take a chance on this CD despite the lack of sample musical clips, this one wasn't a keeper for me and I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for the cost","review":"I picked this up for fifteen dollars at a discount store. It is very cheaply constructed. The grips on the bottom are not sufficient to keep the bike from sliding away from you as you pedal. I had to put a 15 lb tub of cat litter in front of it to be able to exercise without stopping to pull the bike back into position every few minutes. As another reviewer mentioned, this causes me to bump my toes occasionally. The other problem is the tension setting. I find that when I set a tighter tension, it loosens back up fairly quickly. The motion is jerky and it does wobble a bit side to side. If I had paid full price for this, I would be extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be more disappointed","review":"I'm actually pretty impressed with how easy this was to assemble. Only took 5 minutes or so, and it feels high quality.Using it however, makes it completely worthless. I picked this up for $10 at my local Ross Dress for Less, and I see why it was so cheap.It slides all over the place, and the only way to stop that is to put something stable in front of it (like a wall,) but then that makes your foot hit it on every rotation. Even then, it wobbles from side to side when you pedal, shifting position. It's also annoying while pedaling because the strokes are uneven and jerky. Can't expect much I guess, but this makes it useless.I'm throwing mine in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not great","review":"I purchased this camera because Canon has a good reputation with cameras. I had a Richot which I have lost and needed a new camera. The quality of the shots from the Richot seemed much clearer than those from the Canon.

I also found the manual for handling the camera to not be user friendly - which is really rare since most companies try to make it easier for the user to grasp the concept of the new camera and its features. In my eyes, the camera will do for now, but I'm not sure of how long it will be before I replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camera review","review":"The Canon Sure Shot family has always been a great product line however this camera is a piece of junk.

The transition she was going through is a lesson for all of us. Especially when its finding love again after going through the pain of not being loved in return.

Sound quality is distorted and static-y, especially when someone calls you from their cell. Do you enjoy saying, \\"I'm sorry, what did you say?\\" You'd better! I purchased the 900mHz because it was touted as being compatible with DSL. I'm not sure what the issue is. I have a GREAT 900 mHz phone by Lucent--crystal clear in sound transmission, but, so old it didn't have caller ID, etc.Amazon won't help me. It's been over 30 days (around 50 days) since I purchased the phone so of course they won't refund. They gave me a 1-800 number supposedly for GE. It is for \\"Thompson Products\\" who apparently make GE products now. The first try yeilded only an automated system to get info on TV/Vid/DVD (visual) products--no mention of phones!

We were doing a unit on Identity which means learning about one's self. I thought that this book was an excellent choice. During the final chapters, I felt like I was part of the book. This book is about a special complex built for terminally ill patients that were being experimented on for new drugs. This book made me think about how friends can help one another. An example of this is that Barney did not stay in his \\"compartment\\". By staying in his compartment, he would not have helped out Mazzo, which means not getting involved. This book shows that it can be good when \\"you get involved\\". - Justin Z."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits well, but there is one small problem","review":"Got this for a friend.

I couldn't be happier with this protecting my phone. Let me start giving it a 4 out 5 and ill get to explaining why.Pro's: Slim fit, fits very snug, great design, feels AMAZING in hand, texture ads grip to the phone, and the seller shipped extremely fast.Cons; I have one problem with this case and because of this problem i couldn't give it a 5/5 like i wanted to. These guys really should have cut a hole where the power button sits. The volume keys are covered but its perfect. Its almost a struggle to press down the power button but it just needs a little force. Gets annoying after a while! Im going to take a small knife and cut the hole where the power button is. The box was also busted but doesn't take away how great this case is. Best buy for 12 bucks shipped!To the creators, you guys really ought to rethink cutting a hole where the power button is because other than that you struck gold with this little gem of a case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Case for your Motorola Photon 4G","review":"The case's \\"tuxedo black\\" style is what caught my attention. My main reason for having a case was protection, but I didn't want one of the armoured, clunky cases. Well, this case has style, and I'm proud of my Motorola Photon 4G wearing it! But more importantly, this TPU case fits perfectly, like a glove, and gives some valuable protection that a cell phone needs. My only criticism is the same as what other reviewers have said on here: the power button is covered, rather than the case having a cutout for the button. It does take a little oomph to press it down. This is just my first day of ownership, so I'm hoping I'll get used to it with time. (Excellent service from the seller too.) 5/5 stars for product and seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate cover for the Photon","review":"This has to be one of the best covers for a phone I have ever used since my Palm Treo.

I no longer have the time to make a trip to the store (like 5 times a week) so making my own sounded like a great idea. I actually stumbled upon this product while I was in Korean Town, the price was about $8 there. Most off-line Asian grocers are a lot cheaper when you're looking for something like this. But if you don't live near them, I suppose this is the way to go. Anyway this matcha green tea powder really makes perfect home versions of Starbuck's green tea frappuccino, or the ones of JB's. There are higher-end grade powdered green tea out there, but this is perfect for numerous recipes.

The speakerphone function works like a 2 way radio, i.e. you can't talk and listen at the same time. If you plan to use this phone as a business phone, forget it; it's a toy. The speakerphone is useful only for listening purposes, and switching between lines causes a quick burst of static, at least on my model. For the price I suppose it's OK, but if you need a work-horse phone with durability and a useful speakerphone, this isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely free flowing","review":"I put this exhaust on a 4.3 1500 2wd after installing a 350 y-pipe, which is 3\\" collector and bolts right up.

No one can see them but Eva. And so begins a story about life with a twist of psychology.There were many times in this book where I had to stop and think when Eva's companions appeared.

Pure poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite O, but definitely a keeper","review":"I must say that I miss some of Damien Rice's hissing anger that burst forth from a whisper that was featured prominently on the album O. This album replaces that calous anger with a dark bleakness. Where O was put together beautifully and carefully, some songs on 9 seem as though they were put together in a dash, which is odd for an album which took so long to come out. I have been very satisfied with the album as a whole and for a sophomore effort Rice has produced a solid album."},{"rating":"2","title":"9","review":"is damien rice really this confused individual in his love life, or is this just a character he plays through this album and his debut \\"0\\"? he just can't make up his mind. he loves her, he loves her not, he hates her, he loves her now, or maybe it's somone else? he's cheating on her, she's cheating on him, there's a girl that does yoga, and lately he's horny. all of these things come through on \\"9\\" in there own little pornographic/emotional way. although i think i like \\"0\\" a little better (being that that album is perfect!!) \\"9\\" is a great collection of songs from a great singer/songwriter. after listeing to damien'e raw passionate delivery you, the listener, will feel as if you yourself have been in a cracked relationship. or maybe that's because you really have. in then in that case maybe you need this cd more than i do. heres to great musicains makeing great music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He only overshadowed himself...","review":"With the realease of his Freshmen \\"O\\" 4 years ago, Damien Rice has only overshadowed himself with his Sophmore album \\"9\\". This album has a lot of attitude, it is a lot more dark sounding then the first and it is a long time coming from this break through artist. Songs that stick out are the tracks 9 Crimes, Elephant, Dogs, and Grey Room. Still though, Rice pours his voice and soul into every second of every song, even in the song Rootless Tree (which sounds like the lyrics were written by a 14 year old) when song by him sounds remarkable. If you enjoyed \\"O\\" at all, and his B-Sides, this will fit right into your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hm","review":"I like the melody of this album.. but the lyrics are really awful. I thought O was a great album, but this one is just not that good. Remember, this is just my opinion of his album. Some people may find his lyrics in his album powerful, but i didn't feel that way for most of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multi-layered","review":"My knowledge of the artist's music started rather early, before all the hype of the album \\"O\\" or the music \\"Blower's Daughter\\" started (I guess mainly because of the movie, Closer), and I must say to this day, I am still peeling off the layers from the first album and is surprised by the way it touches the raw emotions differently each time.I've only just begun to listen to the new album and although I was skeptical about its perfection at first, I realize now that I judged in haste, for this album means something entirely different than what it meant after the first listen.I have no doubt that \\"9\\" as well as \\"O\\" will continually bring me emotional bliss through my joys and hardships in life. Therefore, because of its boundless potential, I do not hestitate to give it a perfect score."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure i'm not making any friends with this review.","review":"This album, to me, is every bit as throughly unimpressive as everything else this man has done. Call me crazy, but I only consider someone a 'great songwriter' (and I've seen the label pinned on Mr. Rice a time or two) after they've written GREAT SONGS. In the case of the artist in question, I can't name a single one (his best-crafted tune, in my opinion, being \\"The Professor & La Fille Danse\\" from his b-sides release). I would call nearly everything in his existing catalog mediocre, at best. So, I guess you can all start hating me now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Album","review":"I thought the first Damien Rice Album was amazing, this one is better. it's a little more aggressive, but i like it(i mostly listen to metal, but as i get older, my taste in music is getting better,lol).

I play bothof them all of the time. It's very easy and enjoyable to sing along with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Follow-Up Album","review":"As much as I liked \\"O\\" (The movie \\"Closer\\" and Natalie Portman will always be associated with \\"The Blowers Daughter\\"), I think this album built and improved upon his debut. The opening song \\"9 Crimes\\" is wonderful and eerie and the melody has a haunting effect that frames the album perfectly. I also loved the songs \\"Dogs\\" and \\"Coconut Skins.\\" What I think makes this album so refreshing is the way that Rice has made the chorus matter again. I've found that music in recent years has suffered from a long-standing want for choruses that aren't nonsense and superficial gunk. I wish I could say more about why this album is so good, but you'll have to listen for yourself. It's well worth the money, especially for fans of Alexi Murdoch, Badly Drawn Boy, and David Grey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly mediocre","review":"Weak melodies, insults (Rootless Tree), overbearing drums, ugly voice, childish lyrics.

It didn't matter what I did, nothing resolve the problem so I let it charge for 24 hours instead of the 12 hours GE requires. I then proceeded to test the phone and notice immediately that the Caller ID was very difficult to read. And then on several other calls the Caller ID didn't work at all. Also had to have the sound up to maximum and still was hard to listen to callers (I have no hearing problems).

This is one of the variations of first-person narration. The common theme is to give the narrator all knowing insight, VOG (voice of god), compared with the mere mortals surrounding them. In this novel, Mount takes the less traveled path. That being, the less than entirely reliable narrator who evokes pity. The possibilities here are usually more interesting.

Only 23 pages are devoted to Lamentations, and the commentary is superficial and unorganized. One of the key characteristics of Lamentations is its acrostic nature, but the author doesn't even mention this except as an aside in the middle of the discussion. The author includes a couple of historical anecdotes to make the book \\"relevant\\" to modern life, but their relevance to the actual text of Lamentations is questionable at best.I have not yet read the Jeremiah commentary, but if you are looking for help with Lamentations specifically, as I was, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoes come to life","review":"Plot: The book tells the sotry of judge Elena Rincon who lives in Madrid. her dad just died and she has mixed feelings about her relationship with him. there are also other characters who are all looking for love and to make sense of things. But, below the bed (as the title suggests) there is another world where their shoes come to life. The shoes are the ones that make sense of the things and reflect about companionship.

When the mitt arrived the actual color was quite orange and actually almost a dayglow orange.

Yet, with all that hype in costumes and the actual simplicity of music, there is no feel and rhythm now. When Prince came back recently, he brought a magnificent sense of old school R&B to the game again. It is the first time he has released a single, since his public symbol and his feud with Warner Brothers expired. Arguably, he hasn't lost a step, as many people thought. With Musicology, his first single, from the exactly same titled record, he truly brings out the feel of Soul and Earthy, classic R&B to the mainstream. The song is very upbeat, and is a remarkable reintroduction to one of the most influential artists of the late 70's and 80's. If this song is so wonderful on the charts, I can't wait until the albums next single, whenever that'll be. Nevertheless, it is a guilty pleasure that is wonderful to escape into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful Headphones","review":"These headphones do have good audio quality, but there is one HUGE issue...These headphones HURT your head!

Gone is the choppiness (for the most part) and the horrible cut-scenes to a black tunnel or the back of a scoreboard or whatever. Personally, I don't care about the radio-announcer. Madden was totally annoying too. Yeah, I agree, they could improve here but the game is near flawless where it counts: gameplay, graphics and presentation. The new animations are great and I dig the realism: you have to think and strategize with this game, unlike any other Madden.Gripes are few.. personally, I don't like playing in the rain because the mud just looks fake and distracts from the players. Also, why can't we save a game mid-game? Previous Maddens allowed this.Overall, love it. I was so harsh and critical of 06 and 07 that I never thought I'd enjoy another Madden.. well, here is a vast improvement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game Sucks worse than any game I've ever played","review":"The only reason I gave it one star was because there was no option for 0 stars. It took all that was bad from Madden 07 and made it worse. Good luck playing on superstar mode. You can't see anything when you throw the ball, so it's totally up for grabs. I also hope you have the hand-eye cordination of the world's most elite assassin to be able to do the rookie workouts they set for you.

This game lacks many of my favorite features.No coach mode!No computer controlled games. You have to have a user control one team, and because you can't do coach mode, and because the QB will NOT throw the ball on his own, you have to throw the ball youself. So your QB will only be as good as you are.No historic teams.You can't create players in franchise mode.There are fewer created team logos and color options.Lame radio announcers.To make things worse, the regular xbox Madden games are not backward compatible on the xbox 360.

One of the things I liked best about those games was that they were both fun and SIMPLE. Madden '08 has good gameplay, but the endless features and in-game adjustments are a little overwhelming for someone who only wants to play a game every once-in-a-while. This seems like a game that would really benefit from commiting more of it's cache to gameplay and graphics and less to over-thought minutia.That said, the computer AI is much improved. AI players respond smoothly and efficiently to the action on the field and the basic gameplay is very good. The Franchise Mode seems solid.Overall, really good, but be prepared to spend a lot of time either learning the details or getting your butt kicked by people who do."},{"rating":"1","title":"please play you disc in a 360 console","review":"Pop this game into my 360 console, played it once, the next day start, i was about to play it a second time when a message pop out saying \\"Please play this disc in a xbox 360 console, pop it out, pop it back in a couple of times and it still says that!!

I'm sort of new to the Madden series (playing since madden 06), but i think i've seen my share of good and bad maddens. Well anyway, let's start with the good things about this game. You can play as a newly drafted rookie in superstar. DEFINITE plus. You can fully customize a created team and make stadiums, which 07 lacked. Many people like front office mode in Franchise because you can scout players and even relocate your team to various places in North America. On rosters you can edit any player's abilities to make them really bad or good. Weapons is really cool because you can make mismatches to get big plays. Graphics have been totally redone compared to 07 weird lookin graphics. Gameplay is so much smoother! Animations make for a lot better experience. Now for the cons.

This is not the utopia of Star Trek, where we humans are always good and everyone else ends up being so impressed by us in the end. These creatures have seen lots of different sentient beings, and we are just one of them. In fact, we are evolutionarily far behind most of them, and the human is at best tolerated, and at worst, teased for his cluelessness. The only reason anyone chases him is because a more advanced being put knowledge in his head that has worth, and he accidentally killed the brother of an important official.

It is too wordy and boring for little ones, and too short for older kids. The illustrations look like they just tried to maximize clutter in Photoshop: \\"This poem is about snowflakes... we'll paste a snowy tree scene and as many snowflakes as possible on to this page.\\" Mimi and her mom look like possessed construction paper cutouts of monkeys.In short, there's nothing really imaginative about this book. It's a bedtime book about a mother putting her child to bed. You get unimaginative poems about snowflakes, a carousel, a meadow, puppies, mice, and the night sky.Read it before you buy it - I'm sure it appeals to someone... after all, it IS Disney.

The deep grooves, and dark industrial feel of the music, with it's catchey guitars, put this band into their own category of music: Bondage Rock. The cd has a length that is plenty long to give you a mouthfull of their sound, and doesn't leave you craving more. The creative blending of the synths, gritty vocals, beating drums, and beeming guitar and bass, make this band a powerful competitor in today's music scene. Aside from the blank first track, and static track,(a result of the live video footage included on the disk) this is one of the best albums i have heard in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound quality","review":"I am dissapointed with the bad quality of the sound and the large difference between the volume you hear your own voice and that you hear from the caller.

The ringer is extremely loud and cannot be adjusted.Caller ID is bizarre, becasue the order of calls on the phone is completely different than the order of incoming calls. Plus the time-stamps are always wrong, both on caller ID and on answering machine messages.The call-back feature for caller ID simply doesn't work for long-distance numbers-- because the phone will not dial \\"1\\" before dialing.This phone stinks.

We only had this phone for a few months before it became very hard to press the numbers, particularly the most-used numbers of our area code. It is now practically impossible to press the 2 button, and when you mash the 2 button with all your might, it then dials several 2's.Second, after hanging up from a phone call or a misdialed call (see problem #1), you cannot immediately make another call.

Anything more, you will be screaming with each use. The cutting mechanism gets jammed with each pull of the rope. The saw blade attachment is not very sharp, and it takes forever to cut a small limb. The pole is too whippy and difficult to control. Get something better for your arms' sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for soft material","review":"I was looking for a collapsible pruner for trimming some pine trees. I currently use a pruner with a solid wooden pole. The collapsible pole works fine but the cutting head is useless for soft material. Most cutting heads are anvil or scissor types. The Fiskars cutting head is neither. The blade goes into a slot that is about 3/8 inch wide. When cutting soft material, like the new growth on a pine tree, it gets smashed into the groove and is not cut.I took the Fiskars head off and remounted the head from my old pruner (> 50 years old and made of steel with a scissor-type cut), after a little work on my wood-turning lathe to make a transition piece. It works fine now, although the Fiskar pole is a little heavier than I would have liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk","review":"This thing is pretty useless, maybe it would be good for 1/2\\" and under branches but anything over that forget it. The first problem I had with this was the rope was really stretchy so you had to pull like three feet of rope to get it to cut. Then after I replaced that I noticed the blade gets jambed into the plastic housing, actually cutting into it after the cut. This requires taking the unit back down and manually un-sticking it for almost every cut, not practical at all. The saw that comes with it is a joke, the teeth just bent over the first cut I made, probably made out of mild steel or something. The pole seemed to be the only thing worth a damn so I just duct taped my electric chainsaw to the end of that and used it that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be positioned perfectly to work","review":"These are honestly more trouble than they're worth. I've worked with plenty of toggle bolts for work, and these are by far the least user-friendly.

Then one night while playing a game, it simply stopped. The cursor wouldn't budge. I tried reseting the channels (hold down button on the base receiver and bottom of the mouse itself) I also changed the batteries and reinstalled software.

When the wind sings to her of not always being kind, her father does not believe the wind can sing; thus, he punishes innocents who he believed impersonated the wind. But at last the wind succeeds in carrying Danina to freedom, to experiencing the world as both good and bad.This is not a perfect modern fairy tale as the wind on the beach rescuing her is a bit contrived but it is an excellent story.

Leave it off the handset overnight, and it goes dead. A replacement battery costs more than the phone, and I don't think it matters - the batteries just plain suck. Someone wrote something about 300Amphs or something, so maybe that's something to look out for when buying a new phone, because you'll have to after this one drives you up the wall.

I could hardly put it down and the characters I fell in love with are still alive in my mind. This book takes a reader on a magic carpet to the sights, smells and flavors of Paris, but it also creates a wonderful world of its own. The story is totally engrossing and although it's told with a sly simplicity it is full of reverberations about the ways of the world.

However if your an avid gamer who plays all type of games alot then i have to suggest the VP201s or b since its better suited for that task.Hope you find this info useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to ensure your broker profits","review":"Bernstein's plan to foil the purported millenium crisis certainly includes a lot of transactions. I suppose once the crisis passes, then we can all move our money back into stocks to the profit of, surprise, brokers.Just as the British government unloads literally TONS of (gold) bullion, Bernstein recommends stocking up (in the coin form). I suppose that if you compare the cost to capital of all the transactions he recommends, then the dwindling value of gold may look relatively good. Of course, Bernstein has another alternative: a precious metals MUTUAL FUND. Imagine being able to keep brokers as well as professional money managers employed through the Y2K crisis in one fell swoop.If any of Bernstein's predictions for Y2K come true, I'll come back right here and humbly point out where he was right. However, if I have electricity to start my computer, a phone line for my modem, and Amazon.com itself survives the catastrophe, how right will he have been?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More worhtless rhetoric from another doom and gloomer","review":"Don't waste your money on this book.

I was immediately disappointed with this from the first carrot I tried to peel. As the other reviewer noted, this peeler just isn't sharp enough. I gave it a second try a few days later and got so frustrated with it, I almost threw it in the trash right then and there.

Brand New has compiled a record that is I have trouble believing exists still. I've been craving a new sound in music for the last few years and finally here it is. With the combination of an upbeat fast punk and lyrics that make you crave seeing another Brand New show, these guys totally rock. I heard the cd and drove to a show within weeks of hearing it the first time. They show you how much they love their music with songs like mix tape that is just catchy as hell and then show you just how much they rock with songs like seventy times 7. The album is just a beautiful composition beginning to end. Really, to start jamming out to the shower scene and ending with soco amaretto lime, god how can i explain to you what a magnificent creation Your Favorite Weapon just is...if you didn't like this cd, well \\"you're just jealous cuz we're young and in love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"unlike any other","review":"brand new is incredable with heartfelt lyrics and catchy harmonies. they are without a doubt... genius'. some call it \\"emo\\" music witch simply means emotional, and that it is. listen to seventy times 7 which is probably the best song (it is about a best friend found with the singers girlfirend) then browse over to \\"Taking Back Sunday\\" for the response to this song in \\"theres no i in team\\" featured on their self titled album. its a great story and its a sad event but still makes great song material. def check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but had a crack","review":"The CD itself works fine, and it's not scratched or anything, but the CD cover has two cracks on it.

Within a few days I bought their cd and fell in love with Seventy Times Seven with is my current favorite.

Well, at least poppy punk that I didn't listen to when I enjoyed poppy punk. This album is about 5 years late for me. I like a couple of songs a great deal, particularly \\"Seventy Times Seven\\" (which, let me ask, why isn't it called \\"The No Seatbelt Song\\"? Those of you who have the album will understand my inquiry). However, if you still enjoy pop punk a great deal, don't waste anymore of your time with Blink 182 or Good Charolette and get this album and implant every power chord into your brain. If I still found this kind of music exciting, this would be at the very top of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If they hadnt released Deja....","review":"...then I would say that this is am amazing album....but they did release it... and it's such an improvement upon this album that it puts it to shame....but at the same time...thats a good thing. Your Favorite Weapon falls into that \\"sounds like every other pop-punk band\\" category. You can see the roots of their music in this cd but it's not very original where Deja Entendu is. They sound like a different band now than back when this was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like Relient K, but not even close to as good","review":"First off, 3 of my favorite songs are by Brand New including one from this album. But except for that I wish I hadn't wasted the money on this disk. Really it reminds me of Relient K (think the MM H MM) but the difference is that that album is really well put together and sounds great. This one doesn't, even come close, at all. It's sort of emo, but more emotion and less hard-work and talent was utilized. I recommend a solid pass on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to My Band","review":"What happened to the Brand New that I grew up loving? The deep, emotional, meaningful lyrics of \\"The God and the Devil are Raging Inside Me?\\" What happened to that heavy guitar and vocals from Deja Entu?\\" Ugh, this is so poppy and such a horrible generic sound. Nice knowing you, Brand New. Your older stuff remains among my favorite music, but this is garbage. Lyrically and musically, this album belongs in the trash. I guess every great band puts out a crap album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical","review":"I used to be a big fan of Brand New's second album, DEJA ENTENDU, so I bought this one. I was unimpressed. This is a very typical pop-punk emo angst CD. A few of the tracks are all right (\\"The Shower Scene,\\" for example), but there is nothing very impressive here.If you're a fan of DEJA ENTENDU, don't bother. If you're a fan of SUM 41 or GOOD CHARLOTTE, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand Who?","review":"\\"Oh Seventy Times Seven is the best song ever written!\\" All you people with your false hopes of Brand New being just as good as Taking Back Sunday. \\"Seventy Times Seven\\" isn't even nearly as good as \\"There's No \\"I\\" In Team\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautious","review":"This is one of the most amazing cd's I have ever heard in my young life. Every song has such perfect lyrics, the music is unbeliveable, and Jesses voice is flawless.

All the reviews for Deju Entendu say it's awesome, but in my opinion this is far better. I mean, Deju Entendu is ok but you just cant beat the up-beat, catchy melodies in every song on this album. when i listen to this cd, there arent any songs that i skip because all the songs are just incredibly good.this is a great song to listen to when you're pissed off or if you just got dumped or something because a lot of the songs are about wishing people would die. my personal favorites are \\"jude law and a semester abroad\\" and \\"seventy times seven\\" but as i said they're all equally good"},{"rating":"2","title":"listen to my opinion","review":"ok dont get me wrong this cd is good but i think that taking back sunday is better and that the pathetic attempt the lead singer of this band trys to put down the lead singer of tbs(#9) is just horrible but is still a solid cd hehe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanure Handbook","review":"book in good condition and promptyl shippedYour review page is too long and complex.

It takes about 5 minutes to defrost a 8in square at the bottom of your windsheild. I found the best use for this was to put it in my jacket and get the heat from the case, which gets quite hot.My final take: If you don't mind a small burn in your wallet, it works to keep you from freezing, but if you want to defrost a window, keep moving.

The problems I have with it are that it is a little bit small - but I can deal with that, he doesn't have a ton of clothes that take up a lot of room.

He could sing the phone book and I'd listen.That being said, I do think lyrically some of his songs could have been improved upon. \\"What Was,\\" for instance, is a great concept and Perry sings it beautifully, but the lyrics are weak. What a bummer because had he collaborated with a great lyricist, I think it could have easily been released as a single.It's too bad Perry retired so early because I think he could have gone on to enjoy a great solo career had this been his ambition."},{"rating":"2","title":"TURNING POINT","review":"There is no bigger JOURNEY fan than myself.

Not only is it a great return to the days of Street Talk but it also provides the listener with an extremely well-mixed album. Steve's classic ballad stylings are perfectly balanced with his warm, upbeat grooves. This release marks a turning point in SP's career. He's taken inventory and has basked in the glory and unknown achievements of his past. He's either ready to move on to bigger and better things or he's retiring. I hope it is the former!

I just returned the phone because when it is sitting on a desk, you can't possibly see the caller id readout. It is tilted towards the back of the phone so you have to stand up everytime you get a call. Might be okay as a wall phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putting it in the basement","review":"This phone is terrible for decent use. The caller-id is impossible to see and the speaker phone is low quality. It's definitely a low quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to stand up to see caller id.","review":"I'm amazed at this design flaw. I don't have space to wall mount this phone, so It must sit on my desk. However, when it sits on the desk, the display is tilted backwards (away from the person sitting at the desk), so I must stand up to read caller id display (to decide if I want to answer the phone). How annoying. The whole reason I got a speakerphone was so that I could work uninterrupted at my desk if I wanted to answer calls. Now I have to stop my work and stand up to decide. If you can wall mount this phone, the display would be easily visible, and the phone might otherwise work great. I never got as far as to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"everything works on the phone just fine out of the box (to those who disparage the unit being hard to read- just snap on the enclosed piece of plastic with legs to elevate the display... if you read setup instructions that are enclosed it is pretty plain to follow), however after only 5 or 6 months of use, the unit has completely failed. I cannot dial out or pick up an incoming call. the warranty (of course) has expired... so into the trash can it goes I guess. I expect more out of products than just a 6 month service life. stay away from this model and find a better quality alternative!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I bought this for my mom because she needed a new phone, loves big buttons, and caller ID with name. The price is certainly amazing. She is madly in love with this phone; it's like her dream phone - and she is very hard to please.From the other end - speaking to her - I can hear a slight echo. I know when I've called and this is the phone she's answered. Perhaps the echo is in her kitchen, where the phone is, but I don't think so - I think it's a bit \\"cheap,\\" or worth it's price. It's not awful, and not even terrible - it's just fine, but I hear that little bit of echo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality - perfect features!","review":"I bought this phone for my home office and have found it to be great. As always, AT&T is good for quality, but this phone also has all my necessary features. The screen displays the time & date as well as the caller id/call waiting telephone number and name. You can also use the \\"display dial\\" to redial a number appearing on caller id and even has a hold button along with speakerphone. Basically, you get lots of features for a good price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Feature Set","review":"My office installed these phones.Here are the cons:First, loud beep cannot be switched off.Second, no speed dial.Third, when on a call you can't access another number eg if you dial your cell phone voicemail with one number and when it picks up you want to input the access code and the password - you can't do that with this phone.Fourth, no speed dial.Fifth, accessing the directory when you hit the button, it seems to put you into edit mode instantly. Trying to access some numbers I managed to have accidentally entered a whole bunch of caller id's.Sixth, display is hard to see, but if you turn contrast down to minimum (1) then it is OK, but still at an awkward slant.Pros:One Its cheapTwo Its OK to look at, nice and white.Summary. I hate it. I'm thinking of buying my own phone for work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great helper on sentence structure","review":"This was a great help in sentence structure and gave a lot of extra work for my child who had problems in this area.

When I returned, I e-mailed the company again, still no response.

Well I did not see the Route 66 series when it was on tv, then when this was available I looked forward to seeing some of the old road (or good fascmiles of same) and a good road story with it. These are three 'one hour movies' that are actually 50 minutes each with their original commercials. Unless I missed it the only view of Route 66 or any highway is in the cigarette commercials. Well I can say of these three episodes the last one with Lorre, Karloff and Chaney is the best. If you want to cruise the highway look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed coverage with some errors","review":"This is an excellent starting point for studying the transistor implementations of digital logic.

If you are diligent, you will catch them, and it is actually good practice to do so. Still, it gets frustrating. Read with caution. Also, the problems are decent but a bit too easy overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great reference for transistor level logic design.","review":"This text contains a lot of information on logic circuits, from an analog perspective.

Finally, on record, that \\"throb\\" is almost present, probably most notable on the live cut of Stay With Me.Any Faces work is always worth having and the great thing is, it keeps alive the memory of Ronnie Lane.

Yeah yeah yeah...I know...these are the Rod Stewart Faces....well phooey on that.The Faces were a much better band without the egotistical Roddie stealing the limelight.

I'm a fairly astute Stewart and Faces fan having bought all the studio albums back in the 70's, but had never heard of this track until the box set came out. If it isn't the greatest Faces song of all time it is at least a close second to \\"Stay With Me\\". This one has it all, a great slashing Woodie guitar, kick ass bass and drums, Ian pounding the keyboard and Rod singing his brains out as only he could. This one song is worth the price of the box set alone.I was lucky enough to see Faces a couple of months after \\"Maggie May\\" was first released (Boston Common 8/71) and have never forgotten what an incredible live band they were.

I still don't know what the meaning of rock is - but the true spirit of rock is laid bare on the soaring tracks within this set.

For one thing Marilla's character was horrible. You don't like her, I mean she's too mean! And the Berry's were bad. First of all, Mrs. Rachel Lynde's character is now Mrs. Barry the mother of Diana Barry. Second, Diana's traditional racen black hair is now BLOND!!! The movie is too short, they cut almost HALF of the book out. And that ending is tarrible, Marilla saying, \\"I'm going to go fetch Gilbert.\\" or somthing like that. It happens too fast and is not a verry good quality of a movie. If you wan't to see a version of Anne Of Green Gables see the remake with Megan Follows. I would give that a 5!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Transfer to DVD","review":"This transfer to DVD is terrible.

It picks up makes clumps of hair, but doesn't suck them in, so it gathers on the rim and I have to pull it out. There is no bag so when you open up the lid it's very messy and dust goes everywhere.

It has been used so much that the brushes on the beater bar are almost wore off. And yet it still pulls thick, dusy, lent like fuz out of the carpet. It is always full of pet hair, and dirt.

He also gives a brief background into the Gods of the old Germanic peoples. A very well informative and well researched book. However, I think he lacks a little on the part of runecasting, runemagic, and runebinds, But there is enough there to get started if you are a beginner. Very well worth the time and money to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rune book for your coffee table.","review":"This is what I like to call a \\"Coffee-Table\\" book. It has lots of brightly colored pictures which completely dwarf the text and is a nice thing to leave on your coffee-table for your friends to browse through when you have them over for tea and crumpets. Sure, most Rune Workers will need much more depth than this book provides and it offers no insights to the runes that cannot be found elsewhere, but it manages to avoid most of the usual blunders that commercial rune books tend to make and it highlights some important points of the Runic magical tradition. And it serves as a great gentile introduction for acquaintances who wonder why you like to throw wood chips with funny markings around every month.So I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tactics practice","review":"This is the first chess puzzle book I've tried to work my way through, so I don't know how to compare it to others. but I have found it useful so far. It is essentially 100% positions and solutions, with very little explanatory text, but the puzzles themselves seem appropriately graded, and I've only found one error in the solutions (a pretty good error rate from what I've heard about puzzle books). I'm not a very advanced player, so I find myself wishing for a bit more explanation in the solutions sometimes, but generally I can understand them. The book is divided into three sections based on difficulty, and for me, some of the puzzles in the first section were easy, some hard, but all more or less at my level. The other two sections, from the few puzzles I attempted in each, seem much more challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Journaling","review":"Baghdad Bulletin is a fantastic collection of entries of one journalist's experiences.

HP sets the standard for engineering calculators. Unfortunately, the graphing calculators are a little too powerful for use in certain exams, since you can almost program them to do the work for you. My professor specified \\"1 line calculator ONLY\\" for the final exam. It's actually not that easy to find a good scientific calculator that's only 1-line. Most are 2-line, or graphing.For a 1-line calculator, especially for the price, this one is perfect. It's not as small as I had envisioned, but that's because of all the features/functions they have to accommodate. And if you're used to using a larger HP scientific calculator, you'll find this one fairly easy to get used to (despite the lack of RPN date entry mode, due to 1-line limitation)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"Please, I'm begging you, go buy the casio fx-115ms instead.Don't say I never gave you anything"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"Had no issues with fitment on my 2009 VW Jetta TDI.I will be ordering my next on from here as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"good seller...bad item","review":"The pan arrived well within the promised time...extremely well packaged but, and it is a big but...the pan itself was very badly made.

(place a spherical object of your choice upon the surface and walk around while keeping the sphere from rolling off)While there are likely more uses, this is primarily a cake lifter that will come in handing when making multi-tier cakes.

I have a wooden pizza peel but the cake lifter is easier to maneuver. I shape my dough on parchment paper and holding the paper taught, use the cake lifter under to transfer the pizza onto the pizza stone. So much easier than trying to jiggle it of of the peel and having it fold all over itself. I only leave the parchment under the pizza for the first 2 or 3 minutes of cooking because it starts to burn. Just lift up the edge of the pizza with the cake lifter and pull the paper out- easy. And once the pizza is cooked, its easily transported with the cake lifter to a cutting board.I have not had this product long- I'm certain I'll find other uses for it... but if you make pizza this is a great tool to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Throw Away Your Money","review":"This tent may look cute, but the materials are really cheap and it really is so flimsy that it will fall down every time your child moves around in it.

I kid you not, I think I was doing this once a minute for at one point.

To compenate for this they send two poles to stick in holes towards the top of the hideaway. Thus leaving the bottom without any support.In addition to this be very carefull when looking at the dimensions. This thing is deep and high for little kids but barely wide enough to fit one child.In short, don't waste your money on this garbage that doesn't fit more than two toddlers with no elbow room and falls down every time they move.

This vacuum seemed like the answer to our search.Sadly, it is not. The example we received is a very pale imitation of its ancestor. The most glaring flaw is the lack of suction. It will pick up some pet hair and very light dust, but anything resembling dirt is a lost cause. Forget about using the hose. It will pick up a small clump of pet hair, IF you get the hose end within 1/32 of an inch of the offending fur. I'm tempted to say you should spend your money elsewhere, but I have yet to find anything in this segment of the market that works.Sure, it's loud. It's a vacuum, for Pete's sake.

But the ultra was the only thing I could find in Target when my old classic went kaput. Unfortunately, everytime I use this blasted ultra, the belt comes off. And it's a pain to get to the area where the belt is just to twist it back on. In the classic there was an easy little window to twist it back on (and it rarely fell off). The Ultra requires me to grab a screw driver and unscrew lots of bits and then do some finger acrobatics to get the darned belt on. I would not recommend this vac. Go with the classic. I think you still get the power."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"i bought this after reading many reviews and found that they were all in 2 catagories either you loved it or you hated it. i am no exception i really like it. it works like a dream on plush high pile carpets that you can't really run a regular vacuum cleaner over. i don't have any trouble getting it to pick up dirt. the price was great (less than $30) and bags and belts are easy to find and inexpensive. it could have a little more suction in the hose for attachments but it still picks up dirt well. the best use i get out of it is the roller brush. the roller is very strong and keeps going even when used on deep pile carpets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job for the price...","review":"We received our DD for a wedding gift.

Yes, it's noisy but what small motorized appliance isn't?However, the noise just got a whole lot worse after a slight mishap when a cloth strap from a seat cushion got drawn in by the roller and slammed everything to an instant halt. The belt broke, which wasn't surprising and was easily replaced. Having doing so, the next time used it sounded terrible -- much louder and more raucous with noticible vibration. After some disassembly and further inspection I found that the driveshaft that runs the belt is clearly bent. It's only a matter of time now before the bearings will destruct and more belts will break.Yes, I was careless for not watching more closely what I was doing but never expected that a simple cloth strap could do such damage.

I was looking for something sturdy; the Dirt Devil is very sturdy. I've used the Dirt Devil in my home office near the cat litter box for a year and I'll probably go back to the Shark. Dirt Devil will probably never die. It is loud (our dog views it as the Anti-Christ,) requires a cord, and either spills or up-chucks a bit of the cat litter after each use. Currently, I use the Dirt Devil for areas around the litter box and then use my regular vac to clean the spills from the Dirt Devil and to go over the rest of the room.

I was terribly disappointed. First, the battery life is 2-3 days with the PDA in the OFF state, i.e. with no use. I tested this by replacing the AAA batteries 3 times with fresh cells. This is unacceptable; I lost data twice when the batteries drained. (This inidcates a poor design in power supply stage of the device.) Secondly, the non-Palm OS is subject to numerous protection fault errors; this plagued me during scheduling operations, causing me to reset the PDA more than a dozen times, losing data each time. This is a case where you get what you pay for; I'm going to get another PalmIIIxe or a Handspring Deluxe to replace the HELIO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better value than most PDA's","review":"I have spent a lot of time researching the PDA market. The choice was between the eBookman (not yet available) and the Helio. The Helio won on price and availibility. It does everything the other PDA's do, just a little differently and much less costly. I caused a few (Helio) problems on my own, yet I must say VTech customer service was 1) Live, 2) Knowledgeble, and 3) Courteous. Things worth noting: There are some games and applications out there for the Helio. The voice recorder is handy for those who can utilize it. You can sync with Microsoft Outlook seamlessly. There is an ebook reader. The apps with the Helio are user friendly and intuitive as is the Jot handwriting recogntion program. I have found only one flaw-when using the Helio in low/no light situations, the backlight is great except the \\"Exit\\" button is not lit. Having to dig that deep to find a flaw should speak as to this writer's opinion of the VTech Helio. Give it a try, you'll like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"User -friendly review for the curious","review":"I recently bought the VTech Helio,I have, also, recently returned my Vtech Helio. Now, let me tell you why and you can judge my experience for yourself. It seemed to be perfect at first because, let us be honest, those features were a whole lot for the buck. And the applications, although not as thorough and user friendly as on other systems, were satisfactory. But the only programms I could find to download were tetris and one to figure out exact tips. Also, I could not download internet pages, like the New York Times. That made a difference. Finally the voice recorder froze the entire system almost infallibly, meaning I had to reset it and wait several minutes to restart it. Talk about a headache. But they might have improved that bug by now. I have owned and used the Helio, PalmIIIxe, and the Visor deluxe. The Helio has the style, the features, and the Price. But it does not perform to expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scrambled my calendar!","review":"I was so excited about my first PDA -- until I tried to sync it with Outlook on my PC.

OS. i saw that the palm IIIxe was a comparable price to the vtech with most of the same features except the voice recorder. i was very pleased to find out also that there was a keyboard for the palm of which there was not ofr the vtech helio. just dont by the product please. do some comparison shopping also...just dont by the product and dont waste your time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frustrating disappointment","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. In fact, I advise against buying ANY Helio or VTech product. On top of selling a product that has yet to run properly in the two months that I've owned it, Helio's customer service and technical support is a travesty. They simply do not care if you are unhappy with their product and are not focused on improving your situation or making their customers happy. I am in the midst of sending scathing letters to the President, head of customer service and head of technical support demanding a full refund. Amazon.com should no longer carry these products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for basic data","review":"The Helio is just fine for most data storage needs like phonebook, notes and a calc with metric converter.

I am a light user. The Duracell Ultra (recommended) may last 2 or more weeks. Rechargeable are lower in voltage (1.2 volts / cell as opposed to 1.5 volts with alkaline) and cause the battery indicator to appear low, even after a fresh charge. This was a bad choice of power supply.

I do lots of driving in my job, and the voice recorder has been extremely valuable to me for taking notes in my car. And so far the Helio has 95% of the fetures I need. The grafitti is good, and I have had few problems with the O/S. I hope this platform catches on as an attractive alternative to the Palm world, and applications keep on coming. The Helio doesn't feel as tough as the Palm counterparts, but the test of durability will come with time. If you don't feel like spending $...+ for a PDA, but you need a PDA, I whole-heartidly endorse the Vtech Helio, as one of the better PDA's on the market at any price. p.s.

Or if I am in a hurry I press: on, play,-say my message in to the recorder-press stop, and off and im through. It's that easy. And the keyboard isn't as small as I thoght it would be. I don't really use the handwriting I mostly use the stylis. The bad thing is that the keyboard is pretty sensitive and if you press to hard the letter/number goes on 2 or 3 times but thats about it.

The whole construction looked and felt very flimsy, but what really did it for us is the grill grid. It is very thin (almost like bendable aluminium), with some kind of thin teflon/teflon-like non-stick cover on one side (this information should really be reflected in the product description). Cleaning it would be impossible unless you do not plan on ever doing it. We are returning the product. Instead, we bought a two-burner stove and a cast-iron reversible grill/griddle; it worked just great and is not toxic like the non-stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stove!!","review":"I ordered this stove and grill it took a while to showed up, but in time for our hike to grand canyon havasu falls.. amazing trip!! first I expected to be green and it was red no biggie it was hard to open the arms from each side and the grill were getting stuck in time and time again while trying to open ..very annoying, just because of that I almost return it, I am glad I didnt though. Work like a charm it is good quality in comparison to other junk out there..but only the grill is instal-light w ignition the stove is NoT you have to use a lighter everytime.

Buzzsaw reminds me of AKoslin's (we go to the same school) FUTURE TRANSFORMERS Radicon named Raze. His VT (Vehicular Transformation) is a spiked wheel! How cool is that!?! It's way cooler than Hasbro's Buzzsaw. And when Raze becomes an Omega, his new VT's a spiked rim! Overall, this Mini-Con team is well worth the $. They're PERFECT for Cyclonus.

On the old model you could just wind the cord around hooks. On this model there's this ridiculous clip thing that your supposed to clip the cord to - but you have to wind the cord into a loop first. The next most annoying thing is that it's very awkward to use the attachments. You pop off the floor attachment and connect the hose to the bottom of the unit and then have to hold the vacume horizontally by another handle.

I have 2 cats and one of the main reasons I use it is to pick up the cat litter they leave on the floor, so I'm not sure I understand the reviewer who said it won't work for that purpose. If you want a simple, lightweight vaccum for cleaning hard surfaces I'm not sure what else you could ask for.

The woman is a tour-de-force even in these threadbare surroundings, providing voices for all the characters and singing one song per show, but this series will depress older children and bore younger ones to tears (as my own kids will attest). Madacy might have done better to market this one honestly as the curious relic of Seventies camp it is rather than trying to palm it off through deceptive packaging as Miss Lewis's later work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shari Lewis Collection","review":"I was very disappointed with this product. The picture on the front shows Shari as she was in her 1990's series Shari Lewis and Lambchop. That;s the show I wanted DVD's for. I watched the first dvd and the show is stupid.

The early Grammy committee was VERY biased against \\"modern\\" (ESPECIALLY) Rock and Roll music. Even the country category was not exempt from this bias. Due to this attitude, many acts which became classics were (sometimes) openly snubbed while (most) winners were usually never heard from again. This became true in the \\"Best New Artist\\" category, which one former winner (Lead Singer of Men at Work) nicknamed \\"The Kiss of Death\\". Events such as these resulted in other music awards which reflected the music fans opinion began to proliferate, plus the perception of the Grammys becoming a farce to many.For a simple yet through history of the Grammys, I highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very functional","review":"I was disappointed with this product because the opening is too narrow for any but the thinnest slices of bread.

It was neither. The story line was poorly developed, and the acting was flat. Lambert's acting was . . . well . . . tedious, and he gave one of the \\"best\\" performances in the film. Bottom line here is that if you are thinking about buying this flick, just grind your money up in a food processor . . . that, at least, would be visually interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious acting at its best","review":"Historical inaccuracy aside, the cinematography, setting, and costuming where fine. The acting and directing were disgusting, I hope that we never have to suffer another effort from Christopher Lambert again."},{"rating":"1","title":"That almost beats U-571","review":"This film almost beats the worst war/history movie I have ever come across: U-571.Druids looks to me like a bad soap opera. The costumes looked as if the makers of this film have studied cartoons like \\"Asterix and Obelix\\" rather than history books.Christophe Lambert has played in a lot of good movies but also bad ones and this is one of his worst.Everything in this film just has the feel of being fake. The worst are the Teutons who are ALL shown red-haired. What a joke. Did they all fall into the same pot of red paint?Brandauer and his cynicism kept me going in that movie. This is how Caesar should be portrayed: as a ruthless, cynical, and ice-cold careerist politician who walks over corpses to achieve his political aims. That portrayal of Caesar in the film is good and historically accurate.The rest should be kept in silence.If the French ever see how the Gauls are portrayed in this film, the director will never be allowed to enter France again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wretched Non-Epic","review":"\\"Druids\\" is a very important film for those filmmaking types looking to break into the historical epic genre.

Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"I like almost any movie, but I kept this movie around to prove to people that there are movies bad enough for me to not like them! None of the people I showed this to liked it -none of them even finished it!

I like Christopher Lambert. I really do. Even in his awful, cheesy movies. But not this one. At one point during the movie, I turned to my husband and said, \\"Remember when Clint Eastwood went and made Spagetti Westerns? Well, this is a Spaghetti Braveheart.\\" I actually sat through the whole thing. I truly don't know why, and would like to demand two plus hours of my life back, thank you very much. It wasn't exciting, it wasn't epic (well, except in the epic amount of time they took to draw out the most boring battle scene I've seen in my entire life). The best part of this movie (besides when it was finished) was when the townswomen got on the town walls and started baring their breasts to distract the Roman soldiers. Gratuitous breast shots always enlighten a dull movie. Even so, this film gets a rating of \\"what... did they think they were doing?\\" from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Boring and just not what I expected.","review":".... But this movie was honestly a great disappointment. The acting was awful, the plot had little to do at all with Druids. One good thing that came from me getting this awful \\"b\\" movie, was that I was forced to get two really good books on Druids. Skip this movie, they compare it o Braveheart on the slipcase, but do not fall for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly amateurish and embarrasingly awful.","review":"With the exception of a few scenes of very strong imagery and brief battle sequences with interesting music it was really, really bad. I should have known when I saw guys wearing horned helments on the back of the video box that something was up...I can't express how horrible the majority of this movie is, the acting and the silly camera angles is just incredibly bad. Plus the dialogue is so out of step with what you would expect and most of the actors DO NOT look the part in any way. I feel sorry for Mr Lambert. If they didn't have the partial nudity scenes it could have been rated PG. There is no foul language in the film at all which was refreshing. I would say if you are about 12 you would find this to be an epic, but for the rest of us Braveheart is the de facto midevil epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF A GOOD MOVIE TITLE","review":"it could have been so good! but it wasnt! it was like a joke, it made me too mad how bad it was to pay attention, i couldn't finish it at first i just tuned it off, it was only $.99 which is possibly too much, i would change the channel if it was on, just the main characters hair makes you not be able to take him seriously!? for $.99 maybe, but really don't get your hopes up! -WASTE OF A GOOD MOVIE TITLE"},{"rating":"1","title":"A wretched excuse for a film","review":"Now, granted, you can't expect much from a Christopher Lambert straight-to-video release, but I must admit that I do enjoy bad movies from time to time, and I even derived some pleasure from Lambert's Beowulf. However, despite this, Druids is utter filth. Even Lambert doesn't seem to want to be in this one - and that speaks volumes. However, if you down a few alcoholic beverages and want to bash something Mystery Science Theater style, this might be worth a look. I mean, after all, you do get to see a bunch of fat, bearded men running around in their quilted pajamas pretending like they're REALLY in Braveheart 2. All the same, this makes Beowulf seem Oscar-worthy with its incoherent plotline and dirt poor acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Lambert","review":"The only actor I knew in this movie was Lambert. I have never been a fan of his but figured give it a shot as a rental. Well it is a typical Lambert movie only worse. At least in Highlander the script and other actors around Lambert were good. In this movie (which has very little to do with Druids) the script was bad, and the other actors were bad. No one there to save Lambert from his dreadful lisp (get the cotton out of your mouth, even Barbara Walters learned how to get over a speech impediment). Of course there were some historical highlights that a previous review posted, as well as a few anomlies. But the one incorrect thing they put into the movie was the made the leader of the Tuetons a head hunter. It was the Celts who were \\"Head-Hunters\\", after a battle the Celts would collect the heads of important enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comically Bad","review":"I was expecting a bad movie, and this one really delivered.The dialog is super cheesy. Christopher Lambert had a rather unheroic portrayal of the heroic leader of the Gauls. The plot, while not complex, manages to be a little confusing. The movie moves slowly so my wife fell asleep, and I imagine most viewers would not make it to the end.Given my low expectations, I actually enjoyed this movie. The dialog was comically bad. There were some nice equestrian scenes, pretty vistas, and Klaus Maria Brandauer actually got into character as Ceasar. I am now reading more about Vercingetorix, who was so poorly portrayed in this laughable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wrth the money","review":"Sorry folks, but this movie is a shocker. Bad acting, bad storyline, bad script. It was just bad! It just isn't worth the money I paid for it, which wasn't much.Christopher Lambert has made a few bad ones in his day but I reckon this one takes the cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair movie with some serious flaws","review":"Although it has it's share of interesting battle scenes, overall it is rather dull. The absolute worst thing about this movie is the sound editing for English. It's like they include none of the original sound, and tried to dub in everything. Everything sounds fake."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"Once agian Chris Lambert proves his acting is less then spectacular! The acting and dialog were so woooden and dry, that it makes Plan 9 From outer Space look like hamlet! STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, but never lives up.","review":"When I first purchased this movie, I thought it had the potential of being like Braveheart. Unfortunately, the cast was weak, the music was inappropriate (ethereal new age tunes), the battles were boring, and the filming was poor (slow motion camera tricks for no reason at all). Save your money and move onto another film, or if you're interested in still buying the movie, look for my copy in the Used section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic piece of garbage!","review":"Well I didn't make it through the whole movie....I fast forwarded to some battle scenes but even they weren't any good.Positive:Costumes...the romans looked pretty coolNegative:Just about everything else...The acting was horrible, the music was horrible (techno in a historical movie? WTF?)Even the battle scenes (which are usually a highlight in movies) were horrible!I didn't understand the story, mainly due to bad acting & the fact that theres nothing in the movie to draw the audience in.I can't get over the fact of how horrificly bad the acting is!My brother's high school drama class would appear Oscar worthy compared to this movie's cast.One of the worst movies I've ever seen, period!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have read the reviews here, maybe...","review":"... Bleah. I read the reviews here first, and maybe I shouldn't- the movie was ruined after that. Wooden acting, strange wigs (can you believe his hair when he's supposed to be young? that rat's nest?), very bad editing.... Ugh. The story does not flow- it's impossible to follow what's happening. And yes, Caesar has a German accent! EEK! Really, don't bother with it, it's pointless. :P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The only good thing I can say about this debacle is that is not as bad as \\"A Knight's Tale\\". Complete disregard for history, not to mention poorly written and horrible editing. However, the worst thing about this travesty is Christopher Lambert's wig during the beginning scene when they deserately try to convince us that he is a teenager. Definately don't buy this movie!

It is choppy and random and the scene shifts do not seem to make much sense. The movie transitions from loud screaming to whispering alot so you can not just leave the volume at one level. The story could have been interesting had it been told better.The acting left a lot to be desired. Except for the \\"arch-druid,\\" non of the people in leadership roles realy gave off an air of authority.This is a story of a man who was destined to keep Gaul from the Romans only he fails. So technically he was not even destined. This movie tries really hard to be BraveHeart but comes up way short. If you realy have nothing better to do with a couple of hours, and trust me you have something better to do, watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!","review":"I wish that I could have given this movie no stars. I have always watched an entire movie because I feel that there is always a chance the movie could get better before it ends. Well, the movie never got better. Horrible acting, horrible war scenes, did I mention horrible acting. Basically this movie was HORRIBLE!!!Do not waste your time on this movie. I recommend catching up on your sleep, doing some math problems or staring at a wall. All these activities would be more exciting than watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think the Gauls should sue for defamation.","review":"From the moronic script seemingly penned by a 12-year-old to the terrible music, horrible costumes and bad acting, this movie is fit only for an episode of Mystery Science Theater. Don't rent it, and certainly don't buy it; it's a complete waste of time and brain cells. Here's some lines from the movie: \\"Let's go invade Britain! Yay!\\" It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"WIMPHEART","review":"DRUIDS is one of the movies that tries to achieve the lofty status of such movies as BRAVEHEART or GLADIATOR, and fails miserably. Padded with endless scenes of marching soldiers, horses, etc., the movie lacks any true epic proportions. Christopher Lambert is an awful choice for such a fierce and charismatic leader; and the hairdos are preposterous. Then we get German actor Klaus Maria Brandauer with his heavy accent and his attempt to mimic the hairdo of Marlon Brando in the role of a flaccid and boring Julius Caesar. Not being a true historic buff, I can't attest to the accuracy of the story, but I'm sure it should have been more exciting. Some of the battle scenes have some power, but overall DRUIDS joins a list of other Lambert movies to avoid including THE TARGET. The music is also anachronistic and unsuited for this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"This movie was a dissapointment to say the least. From watching the jazzed up previews, one would compare this movie to Braveheart, but from the first scene, the reality of this movie's abusurdity sets in. I actually thought after viewing the first scene, that this movie was made for children. But, after watching a few more, I realized that it is just bad. First, there was the editing. The scenes are either too short or too long. And it looks as if the movie has been dubbed! Second, the acting. I didn't expect much from Christopher Lambert.. but from the rest of the normally wonderful actors, I was sadly dissapointed and shocked.This movie is based on a book, and the book is actually quite good...but this just makes a mockery of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booty galore!","review":"This is perhaps one of the most dreadful movies ever made, so bad that it is unintentionally hilarious. Which is how I got the idea for this new parlor game...Invite all your friends over and put this movie on. Everytime someone in the film says the word \\"booty\\" everyone has to take a drink. The first one to pass out wins and doesn't have to watch the rest of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I beg to disagree","review":"I just read this book a few weeks ago and the fact that I can barely remember the characters is telling. I realy have to disagree with those readers who found t his book, enthralling, great ... Reading it was actually a chore. If a book interests me, I tend to try to read it in ne sitting. It took me ages to finish this book and in between I read a Linda Howard and a John Grisham. If you want a really enthralling vampire read, try one of Linda Lael Miller's Vampire series or, better still, Jasmine Cresswell's Prince of the Night. The latter is probably one of the most original vampire and enthralling romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed with this book.

I found myself skipping over sections, which I rarely do. The Grigori was yet again another typical vamp, a gorgeous mysterious dead old guy falling for a sweet young thing, in this case Marissa. There was nothing about Marissa that explains why she was the one to evoke his long dormant passions, unless it was that she didn't immediately fall in bed with him. On top of that, when the wife that he's grieved for and tried avenge for centuries ends up being still alive, he picks Marissa. I was hoping that Marissa would smarten up and choose the vampire hunter instead. I admit I may be a little bit jaded since I read 5-6 books a week, but there are definitely much better vampire romances out there. Save your money on this and use it to buy one of those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"I was disappointed with this book:In my opinion, Marisa wasn't a believeable person. She was a person with no physical flaws, a 20-something year old VIRGIN, and an icon of the \\"good girl\\". Grigory was too nonchalant. Even though he loved her, Grigori hardly any showed jealousy or aggression when he knew Edward wanted her.

I didn't like it for a number of reasons, one: because it took place in the 90's, two: after a while the books get a bit repetitive, three: I didn't like how the vampire hunter just hung around and I didn't like the story line.

But the software handcuffs it. In an effort to make things easy for the naive user, HP has brain damaged it beyond repair. For example - once you preview and then do a final scan, it throws you out of the preview screen and into the picture viewer. If you want to redo the scan, or scan a different part of the image, you have to get out of the viewer, back to the scanner, do another preview ... see the problem?On quality - all I can say from a brief trial is that the 2400 dpi scan of negatives was noticeably less sharp than a 2400 dpi scan I sent out to Kodak.I'm told that the higher end and older HP scanners - the 5400 and 7400 series - come with less inflexible software.

The \\"HP Director\\" software barely works, it is often unsuccessful attempting to launch other applications to do its bidding, especially when trying to set preferences.Using the copy machine functionality to scan and print, doesn't appear to work with my HP printer, as the scanning software complains about the image being too wide (before it even starts scanning) which isn't the case.I'm still trying to get it to reliably scan a document without \\"surprises\\" and I haven't even looked at the other features.I'm a power user, and know my way around OS X.The HP software is horrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"read below","review":"Naturally, the scanner creates good quality images.

The second went on just as smooth but perhaps because of the precipitation, the dye on the bumper started to crack and fade off. I put another coat on last night but again, it rained a bit so I'm not sure how it'll look today.

If you do, make sure you don't get any over spray or let the cleaning rag touch the treated parts. They will get permanently blotchy.

I used two bottles of Back to Black trying to get all the black plastic back to prime condition, but it made no difference on the badly sun-damaged plastic. This product turned every square inch of my plastic back to like new condition. My only negative is that the applicator tip was pretty much gone by the time I got to the running boards. I used a foam applicator that came with some tire dressing to finish the job and it looks great. After doing bed rails, front and rear bumper, intake cowls, door handles, mirrors, and running boards on a 4-door full-sized pickup, I still have enough to do another truck.

It has stayed on (now 2 months) - and it looks natural (not shiny). Please remember to TAKE YOUR TIME - I did one area a day - so that makes it easier to do an excellent job. A few times I had to go back over places when I saw small streaks - sometimes I used the larger foam throw away brushes. I even did my windshield wipers.

The whole movie has an admirable student film feel about it, and has some surprising cameo's, and the performances by the leads are quite good, showing promise.There are no extra's on the DVD release, and my biggest piece of advice is \\"Try before you buy\\". Go out and rent this movie first !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the same","review":"Amr Diab does not waste any time and starts this album with Habibi (Ya Nour El Ain), the greatest hit in recent Middle East memory; its infectious rhythm and melody will put a hook into your brain good and firm once you hear it. The second song, Amarain, possibly my favourite on this album, is sort of the same thing... and so is the rest of the album. While newcomers to Arabic pop may find the whole lot exotic enough, for me it began to feel repetative enough after few songs. Khaled's contribution on the third track is cool but the whole song is uneven- his voice is way too good to be used in such a ditty. Overall, this is a good collection of Amr's songs, but not more than this. Western ears may need to adjust to the quarter tones scale and the sound of the strings, but it is well worth it. And once you're ready for a close to perfect album of this type of music, check out Mandam Aleyk by Nawal el-Zoghbi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trucks and Tractors, Oh My!","review":"This DVD has four great episodes that feature Bob the Builder and his friends.

I felt that I would have enjoyed reading more about his life after 1960 - after that it was fairly sketchy.

I bought it for a price that is cheaper than those large books.

When I was a new mother and was desperately looking for guidance on getting my daughter on a health sleep schedule, this book provided me with easy-to-follow steps that worked. My daughter has been sleeping through the night since about 7 months and takes a good nap everyday. As a result, she is always bright and attentive and her moments of fussiness and crankiness are few and far between. I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

The methods in this book are surprisingly simple (I had doubts they would work), but it was exactly as the author described...finally I had life in order and my baby was actually looking forward to sleep times and my husband and I had evenings together again. I implemented this book for my 2nd and 3rd babies as well, and again...it was suprisingly simple and there were no problems with either of them.

Check.Mysterious Woman. Check.Hidden Treasure. Check.Templar Knights. Check.Retired spy dragged into adventure against his better judgment. Check.All the basic checkmarks are there for a formulaic adventure novel, but there is absolutely nothing at all that raises this beyond being predictable and pedestrian. No humour, limited mystery, few cliffhangers and characters that are just barely interesting. Even worse, the historical characters are presented in a way that keeps them from being memorable. As they are referenced in the novel, it becomes a bit of a slog to remember who they were (and why I should care).

The book is fast paced and informative at the same time. For those who like what I call a well written History/Mystery/Thriller this will fit the bill. Berry has the capacity to write his tales and weave in and out of holes in history without the need to manipulate or change it to suit his needs as other writers are want to do.The Templar Legacy follows the path of Stephanie Nelle as she seeks to put to rest the ghost that haunt her after losing her husband and her son to their love of history and search for the knowledge and wealth that the Templars left behind. Alone now she finds herself in the company of an old work companion, a field agent named Cotton Malone. Good thing..she needs his help while they are chased, shot at, and lead down the merry path while trying to solve 700 year old riddles.Berry offers good fast paced reading for bedtime, beach or rainy days.

The \\"heroes\\" are not even all that likeable, the plot is too convoluted and the climax not very credible. I stuck with it to the end, trying to get my money's worth, but by the time it got better I was no longer interested in how it came out. No one expects their historical thrillers to be totally plausible---after all, other than the discovery of King Tut's tomb in the 1920's, what hidden treasure has ever surfaced in the past 80 years?

For example, the word ensconse was used 2-3 times in the the course of 2 or 3 chapters, and then dissapeared completely from the author's vocabulary. And who uses the word eidetic in everyday conversation?Perhaps the biggest problem I had w/ the story was how the author conveniently \\"forgot\\" to reconcile the resolution of the story w/ the well described goal of Cassiopeia Vitt's desire to bring down Christianity.

I had put off reading this book for a while because of the negative comparisons to THE DAVINCI CODE, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that there weren't enough similarities to put me off. I'm a sucker for a good exotic thriller, one that takes me places that I will never visit other than through books, and moreso than the plot of this particular book, Mr. Berry's lucid, intelligent writing style is what will get my return business.

If you can suspend the disbelief caused by the myriad coincidences in the book (most notably de Rocquefort's stunning ability to know exactly where and what Malone will be next, even after ditching the tracking device), then you'll love the book. It says nothing new about Templar conspiracies that hasn't been said a million times before, but it is a fun read, with great chases and exciting confrontaitons between villains and protagonists.

All in all, a great book for the beach.I wondered about the author's connection to James Rollins, as Rollins' latest novel, \\"Black Order,\\" begins in Denmark, involves booksellers and makes a reference to an ex-attorney from Georgia, which I believe is the former occupation of Malone.

Even the most uneducated detractor of Catholicism realizes that a statue or picture of Jesus is like a photo of a beloved family member which helps keep one's mind on the spiritual object of the prayer.
