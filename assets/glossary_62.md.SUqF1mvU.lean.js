It definitely gives you the feeling of being at one of their early concerts from back in the '70's. Just put this album on and the second you press PLAY on your CD player, you'll feel like you're there! The louder you play it, the closer you get!

Buy it, bring it home, and CRANK IT UP!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Competent Live Album","review":"By the time this 1978 live album was recorded, Aerosmith were already falling into a steep decline, and the album plays testament to that. Several times on the album the band sounds completely fried, and Steven Tyler messes up the lyrics quite regularly. The band sounds out of rythem sometimes, and \\"Back in the Saddle\\" sounds REALLY off (although the heavy bass sound of the studio version is quite difficult to duplicate live).That said, this is stil pretty good. The band on the whole perform decent renditions of all the Aerosmith classics, as well as a few rarities. The set list is pretty solid, with no huge holes in the canon of Aerosmith classics (though \\"Train Kept a Rollin\\" is sadly abbreviated).Overall, this is a solid purchase for a fan of '70s Aerosmith. While it may not be great by any stretch of the imagination, it is competent enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHEESECAKE! POPCORN!","review":"This stuff is ok, but I don't think there has ever been an Aerosmith Live album that has impressed me too much.Probably just me- I don't like many live albums.Even to this day, Aerosmith really can still put on a show, but, transcending a live act to album is a hard task. The reason I'm spilling any ink over this anyway though is due to the last couple tracks.MOTHER POPCORN and AIN'T GOT YOU; these were recorded by WBCN in Boston in the early seventies before the debut record. I wish the whole show was available on a disc, (I'm sure it is on ACTUAL bootleg.)My advice is to get this disc CHEAP, as the rest is a lot of stuff you may find enjoyable once. The two BCN tracks are scorchers (very funk and blues though)."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Dead Bootleg","review":"Go back, go back, the other folks are being sentimental or loyal. From an Aero-fan from way back when, I can tell you that this album, which sounded like it was recorded in a shoe box, is awful. It's worth it for a few things that may strike your taste, e.g. a recording of \\"Mother Popcorn\\" in which the band is outshined by the guest saxophonist, a raw energetic studio run through of \\"Come Together\\", a nice performance of \\"Chip Away At the Stone\\".

Still deeply troubled by the way he handled Cali after her husband Nathan's (John's partner and best friend) death, ten years ago, he knew this had to be serious in order for her to seek him out. John and Cali work together to uncover the truth behind her husband's death. Their lives are in danger and this draws them closer together.Cali is a strong female character and John is a wonderful alpha male.

Check our Linda Eder if you're a Jane fan or check out this album if you like Linda Eder.Great music either way"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd will blow you away!!","review":"I've had a love affair with Jane Olivor for 20 years now. It was this album that hooked me and I've been hooked ever since. I actually had the 8-track tape and used to play it on my way to work and to whoever entered my car. I think because of \\"Stay the Night\\" I must have converted at least 20 people who are now big Olivor fans. This cd is a must for every cd owner. I thought the 8-track was great, but the cd is even clearer, everything can be heard. Jane Olivor relays the feelings of love to its very core. An honest and sincere recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHERE ARE YOU JANE?","review":"I miss Jane Olivor. Always on the fringe of the mainstream, this emotional singer resonated deeply in me; I still love this album and consider it one of my favorites. Jane's haunting voice is like a combination of Streisand, Celine Dion and Joan Baez; a liquid fusion of heart and soul. The songs on this album are inconsistent, but each displays Jane's many colors, from the seductive pop cover He's So Fine to the optimistically candy-coated The Right Garden. It's hard to resist the pleasures of this album; if you never gave Jane a try, listen now. And Jane, if you are out there, why have you disappeared?"},{"rating":"1","title":"More like a reader's peril","review":"If you're collecting the Shatner/Trek series, skip this one.

It's been a long time since I read an original Trek story I liked, and Shatner's writing is lacking the warmth and depth of character that I used to enjoy in Trek novels.I know that all the Trek TV series are on-going stories of the characters but why do so many of these novels have to be series (trilogies, etc.)? Other than just for pulling in more money. I've wasted plenty of time (and book money) on 1st volumes....It's time to move on.... Where have all the stand-alone science fiction novels gone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"With the latest 'Shatnerverse' novel it might be time to consider putting William Shatner's Kirk novels out to pasture. This is the first title in a planned trilogy but it not only fails to hold the readers interest, it's down right ludicrous in many ways.Set on Bajor after the Dominion War where Kirk and Picard are taking a joint vacation planning to explore an archeology site they find themselves caught up in a web of deception that has escalated to murder. Through flashbacks Kirk remembers a missionearly in his career as captain of the Enterprise. The flashbacks are meant to set up the subsequent books but long before the end of this novel I found myself losing interest in the long-winded narrative.If you're a die-hard fan and will read this title anyway, wait for the paperback.

After all, with so many bands producing music like this, it is hard to produce a powerhouse album. For the listener who has not experienced any rapcore before, this is a nice, raw album to start out with. My taste is more for a polished product though. And this is not a polished product. If you want a Christian rapcore album that rivals the hodgepodge of secular rapcore out there then I would suggest P.O.D.'s The Fundamental Elements of Southtown. I exchanged shock of tha hour for that and am a happy listener.

That is the only thing comical with this album. The sound of early ELO is a little brash, but this CD has extremely ingenious tunes throughout. \\"Daybreaker\\" is one of my top ELO tunes of all time and \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\\" is the most unique classical adaptation you'll hear in rock music. A definite must for the ELO fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORTH A LISTEN","review":"I say worth a listen if you are a hardcore, buy everything ELO fan, but for beginners who are just starting to listen to ELO, this is an easy pass. Granted the re-mastering sound is great and there are parts of this album I do kind of enjoy, but I find most of it hard to ingest. I can't really seem to want to listen to the album as a whole, just parts of it. Giving it 2 stars may be a little harsh. It's not a bad album or horrible by any means.

I suppose whoever said that meant from Face The Music on, when they started to develop a more commerical sound.I love ELO all the way up through Out of the Blue, but I can see what he meant. Their later stuff is something of a guilty pleasure. And with Discovery, I think they may have gone too far.But this album is my favorite and I would vote it as their best.

I not only want my money back for this cd i also want the time I wasted listening through it once! These guys are like the Simple Plan of emo.

(Not good enough to release two versions of the same CD, however, even if it did have different artwork and DVDs inside.) Personally, the screaming \\"thing\\" doesn't add to the songs because it's such an OVERUSED device in several types of music nowadays, so it makes me want to skip ahead and see what's next rather than listen to the song finish. Guys in H.H., if you ever read any of these reviews, look for a different gimmick than \\"Emo-Screamo\\". If you want to wear your hearts on your sleeves, that's fine, but when you blend in with everyone else, your music will get lost in the shuffle.

While listening I was trying to figure out what was so different between the two, as the songs on both tell a story, and you can definitely hear the celtic-type voices - what I realized was that many of the songs on this CD could be categorized as \\"folk\\" music, whereas on the other CD, it was clearly celtic...

The computer compartment is very well padded and split in two so that I can put the PC in one side and power cord and mouse in the other. The velcro closure strap inside the padded compartment, however, seems unnecessary and is a hassle. I'll probably cut it off. The bag is light and well-constructed. It also has good storage capacity on the front side that can hold documents and things. But the water bottle holder on the side is way too small to be of use.

I agree completely with all of them. I found the author to be completely obnoxious in terms of her clear disdain towards her essentially \\"fat slob jerk\\" older brother, and equally obnoxious to compare a \\"fat slob jerk\\" sibling to a sibling that's truly mentally or physically disabled. My favorite moment is when she is with an unmarried patient(I guess a \\"normal\\")who is having some difficulties with dealing with the holiday's, and she magnanimously liberates her from those feelings by asking her \\"Does it bother you that my life is so much better than yours?\\" or something to that effect. This gives you a taste of the level of self-centeredness that permeates the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bibliotherapy for the author","review":"I found this book infuriating. The entire first chapter is basically the author feeding the reader a predigested, much too reductive analysis of her family background. She seems overly invested in her status and her perception of herself as a \\"sensitive\\" person. This permeates the entire book; it's self-referential in the extreme and seems to have been written as bibliotherapy for the author in order to make herself feel better.She also lumps together the disabled, mentally ill, and simply \\"obnoxious\\" (!!) siblings as if there is no difference in who they are and how they have an impact on their families.I do think that this is an important subject, and has needed to be addressed in nonfiction for quite some time. (Authors of fiction have gotten there first; for example, Cathi Hanauer's MY SISTER'S BONES.)Finally, and, most important: what exactly IS \\"normal\\"? Who defines it? And why is it so important to be \\"normal,\\" anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Presents worst-case only - unbalanced and self-serving","review":"I read this book to gain insight as I have a disabled child and several other children. The author of this book has a very skewed version of reality. Even her own culture promotes the kind treatment of the disabled and mentally ill, yet she feels \\"Normal\\" siblings would benefit from having the other child institutionalized. The scenes described int his book do not occur in our home as we are active and involved parents, not misguided and overly indulgent while ignoring the \\"normal child\\" which is the only description of parents afforded in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book changed my life","review":"I had never before read such truth and honesty about growing up in a home with a damaged sibling. I spent my entire childhood and teen years caretaking a severely disabled sibling--violent, abusive, stronger and bigger than me. I was a teen girl told by my parents it would make me \\"stronger\\" to have to face this. Safer does not write off the disabled as 'obnoxious' rather, she addresses the hard truth: that society today willfully and blindly ignores the damage done by not acknowledging how difficult it is to grow up in these circumstances. Future books may do this more deeply or differently, but this is a groundbreaking work and deserves attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"The history of Kwanza was good; the storyline BAD!","review":"OK!

Family forgives husband. Town rallies around husband to prevent the bad guys from getting him. Husband & wife go on the run to clear name. Wife saves husband. Family lives happily ever after.Give me a break! This book was really fictitious. I could not beleive half of the things the characters were saying or their actions.

So far it keeps good time and that is always a plus, however, there are several flaws. While the analog is easy to read, the digital display is very hard to read, and when you're wearing it, wrist movements will change the settings. The watch light is pretty much useless and the watch clasp and band are flimsy and it is difficult to open the clasp. There was no guide for adjusting the band, so it required that I bring it to a jeweler in fear of breaking it.Despite the flaws I like the look of it, and it's doubtful you'll find a nicer looking piece at the price. It's easy to set. but it's not as well made as I had hoped. It's a nice looking casual watch to tell the time, but unless you're superman, you go blind trying to read the digital functions.

This book absolutely fills that bill.The writing is captivating. The Steppe was actually my favorite. I understand how some might see it as slow or plodding; yet the visual and auditory descriptions were so complete and mesmerizing.I will definitely be looking into more Chekhov.I should note that I picked up this book specifically because the same translators (Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky) of these stories also translated the much lauded Anna Karenina recently popularized by Oprah Winfrey. They again do a wonderful job! I will look for other Russian translations from this duo in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"The entire story was a bore to me. The plot was contrived to the point of the ridiculous. The method used to 'execute' one of the characters impossible to carry off.The repitition of paragraphs of miles of text--re-worded--- put me in mind of an author desperate to stretch a short story or an essay into a multi-hundred page book to meet some deadline.

It's been a week since I read this book and even thought I haven't read the sequel, finding out what happened to my favorite character means I will never read the Marriage Prize.

It's obvious Virginia Henley has a great time writing her books, but she can and does take enormous liberties with history, namely compression. The events described in this book took place over a thirty-year period--she compresses it into maybe three (God forbid her heroine should approach thirty!).

I'm one of those people who usually wouldn't go near the Romance aisle of the bookstore, but this book was on a countertop display. I made an impulse purchase, and now regret the waste of my (money). I found that despite her attempt at a strong, roguish leading man, the author ended up with the embodiment of why we needed the feminist movement. I found his behavior disgusting. I also disliked Eleanor intensely. Yes, I realize that she was royalty and spoiled etc., but after about 50 pages filled with whining and pouting, I just had to go talk with someone mildly interesting so I didn't go nuts.

But apparently God is fun to hang with, because he and his posse get invited to a lot of parties, including a wedding, which is basically a week-long wine and dance party celebrating some lucky guy's attempt to get back to Genesis I and 2.

His less than Christ-like attitude toward others who disagree with his theology also is evident.I simply have a hard time reading a book from Mark.

This book restores my hope in the idea of a modern day church that will do more than just be a remnant. This book helped me to see that you can believe in absolute truth and still reach a world that is dying to meet Truth.

Not everything will translate out of Seattle, but we need to realize this cannot be 'your grandmas church' even in small town America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Funny, Interesting","review":"It took me forever to start this book. I wasn't expecting all that much. But I was pleasantly surprised from the first chapter. Cynthia tells a great story that holds your interest. It's fun and funny and I just wanted to keep reading. I will admit that I got a little tired of it by the end, but still and enjoyable read by a great writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was hooked on this book when I first started reading it. The first few chapters were hilarious! I laughed out loud a few times during the first chapter alone. Then around the time she stopped talking about her childhood and moved on to her adult life, I lost interest. Very quickly. I began finding it a chore to finish each chapter. I would read a few pages, put it down, then not pick it up again for a couple of days. Usually I would finish a book of this length in one night, but it took me almost two weeks of on and off reading to complete it. I recommend that you do not pay for this book. If you think that it looks interesting, go to the library. I regret paying the small price that I did for it. I wouldn't want someone else to make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I have never written one of these reviews, but I was so dumbfounded by the attention for this book that I felt compelled.I have NO IDEA why Amazon mentions Cynthia Kaplan along with David Sedaris and Augusten Burroughs. As I read it, I kept thinking she's probably the sort of person who writes funny e-mails, so all her friends tell her, \\"You should write a book.\\"I was mildly entertained and nothing more -- well, no, actually there *was* something more. There was white-hot rage that this profoundly mediocre book not only made it into print but had been RECOMMENDED as something I might like, which had me traipsing over to my favorite used-book retailer to pay $2 for it. Which was $2 too much for something so absolutely ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!!","review":"Being home with a newborn during all the news of Hurricane Katrina and Rita and impending doom and destruction-this was just what I needed!!! Very funny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ups and Downs","review":"The author does a great job alternating between the funny and the sad. It's a life story ride that is just wild enough to make you almost forget it's real. The same kind of book as Running With Scissors and My Fractured Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't even finish this book.","review":"Okay, I ordered this book because it sounded funny and entertaining. I could never get into it...I guess I was looking for something more solid. I could never get hooked on it. There might have been a few things that made me smile, but overall I couldn't flip the pages fast enough. I read about 100 pages and then I just gave up. I mean what's the point of this book? Just because there might be a few funny things that happened to you in your life doesn't mean it will make a great memoir. I wouldn't recommend this book because I thought it was boring and there was never a moment where I felt compelled to keep reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Not Afraid To Tell It Like It is. I Like that.","review":"This book is well written, funny and a quick read. It's the kind of book you can take on a plane and finish it (even with interruptions) on a cross-country flight, and the person sitting next to you either sneaks peeks or asks you if it's good when he finds you smiling or even chuckling. Or, if your husband is on the other side of you, you set the book on his tray table and say, \\"read this passage!\\" knowing fully well it will crack him up. I particularly appreciated the author's honesty and her willingness to share these stories. I feel it took courage to do so. Bravo Ms. Kaplan, and thanks for the laughs. What's next?Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rambling, free flow fun! I loved this book!","review":"I don't feel quite so neurotic since reading this book. Many of her observations/fears of life are similar to ones I share - but would never admit! I laughed out loud several times - and almost cried several times as well. The details about her grandmother's decline were so absolutely believable and insightful. I not only like Cynthia Kaplan's book, I would like her as a friend. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I'm Like This...","review":"I can add this book to the list of books that I have started to read and cannot bring myself to finish. I ordered this book because the author was compared to David Sedaris (an author that I read because he was compared to Augusten Burroughs - who is the funniest) but found out that she is nothing like Sedaris unless you compare her to one of his earlier works-which are not funny either.Not only did I find this author unable to make me laugh, I did not smile once or even find a mildy amusing sentence. I cannot even give you an instance of a stupid anecdote because they are ALL so boring that I cannot remember one.Save your money - borrow from the library. I picked up \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" the other day and find it extremely interesting and well written - not funny but worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"I find myself quoting this book....","review":"Acutely insightful, hilarious, profound. I find myself quoting lines from this book all the time.It's rare that a writer can make me laugh again and again just thinking of a line. \\"...I went out and bought myself a new hat.\\" \\"...he fell asleep on the bench with a piece of toast in his hand\\" \\"this hand-holder,\\" etc. Cynthia Kaplan is one of those rare few.As I did with David Sedaris when I first became aware of him, and Patrick Dennis, when they re-issued Little Me, Why I'm Like This is one of those comic gems that I find myself giving as a gift to people I really like.I hope she writes another book. Soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed so hard, with stitches, not comfortable...","review":"Honest and so entertaining. The love that she shares for her grandmother, husband and son, family in general, perfect. Life is a struggle and it blindsides you, but Kaplan finds the humor and the silver lining. I too looked to see if she had other books I could buy from Amazon..I hope she is writing as I type this. Don't have a clue what the lukewarm reviewers are thinking!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"funny, i guess.","review":"I'm sort of unable to figure out why Cynthia Kaplan was asked to write this book. I mean, it's cute and amusing, but I always got the feeling she wanted for us all to be bowled over by her talent, which isn't at all overwhelming. In particular, the chapter where she discusses wanting to get pregnant, I could never stop thinking about her going through the experience and thinking about how she could best come up with a clever way to put it, for her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for New Mothers and Already Married Women","review":"As my title suggests, this is a ideal book for either young mothers, married women or both of the above, other than that, I could not stand her constant mentioning of how great her David/ the authors husband is. Oh my goodness it did not lighten up one bit. Please, spare me the intricate details of your happiness...as a near 30 year old woman myself who is practically terminally single and have had many more awkward moments than this woman has in two years I could certainly sell more books & keep single girls hopes up as well by writing my own tome as she has done. Again, great book if your married, a mommy and unbelievably happy with your life but it is certainly a let down if your in you are in limbo like me, waiting for the bad things to just let up a little bit in your daily life & you are eventually hoping to meet someone remotely interesting who is not already married, engaged or on Americas Most Wanted criminal list. A deflating book, pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"like this = self centered, shallow and annoying","review":"A lot of this book was familiar to me having grown up in the Northeast. The embracing of the self centered, shallow and annoying character traits was exhausting. I kept waiting for her to pick up a mirror, say \\"Ew\\" and then gain at least desire for depth. Reading the acknowledgements made me want to slap those folks for encouraging her and myself for not noticing the \\"USA Today\\" aka McPaper was the source of the \\"Knee-slapping hilarious\\" review. I even paid full price for it!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly amusing","review":"Cynthia Kaplan is a talented writer, but she's nowhere close to being \\"the female David Sedaris.\\" Her writing style is nice, and her essay on her grandmother's Alzheimner's is beautiful. Mostly, though, she is too self-conscious and whiny to be funny. You don't have to be completely comfy with all your flaws to be funny about them, but you do have to be honest. The way Kaplan pokes fun at herself seems false, because it's clear that at the end of the day she still wants the reader to think of her as the cleverest girl in class."},{"rating":"1","title":"the book started out really strong...","review":"the book started out really strong. stories (vignettes/chapters/whatever) about her childhood and crap that happened to her. not like, abuse, but seeing a fat girl at summer camp receive head--stuff like that.and then it degenerated into a mommy blog.i can't get pregnant. blah infertility. blah we're pregnant. blah we went on vacation and my son doesn't love the boob. blah he loves it again.frankly, i don't care.interspersed with the baby crap, there were some stories about her grandma and her alzheimers. those were good.i could have done with a lot more grandma stories or childhood stories and a lot less about pregnancy and having a kid.the stuff that wasn't baby related was really good though."},{"rating":"1","title":"More blog than book","review":"A female version of the talented Sedaris? Not so much. This book is more like an edited blog entry than a masterpiece of a memoir.If you are as numb to everyday eccentricities as I am, you'll find this book boring and ordinary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Funny","review":"The back cover of the book boasts: \\"Knee-slapping hilarious.\\" Eh. Not so much. I generally enjoy how some good writers can make even the mundane funny (David Sedaris comes to mind). But just because you think you're funny doesn't mean you should write. To be fair, there are some enjoyable essays here (particularly \\"The Good Swimmer Or How I Lost Him\\"), but the bulk are just collections of stuff that would be more suitable on a mildly funny blog, not in a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Representation of History","review":"I had to pick a book to do for History. I read this book and it seemed okay. Then I sat and thought about how it was so against men. How it showed men being the accusers more than women, when in fact, it was almost the opposite. I don't recommend this book to anyone. It gives you somewhat of an overview as to what took place during the witch trials in Europe, but take it serioulsy. The facts are seriously distorted."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Revisionism.","review":"Most historians have soundly rejected Barstow's theories and methods (in fact, I know a professor who uses one of her books as an example of poor scholarship).

He would have us believe that he would not change a thing about his childhood, his failed first marriage, and his struggles with becoming the man he wanted to be. The book lacks a good flow of ideas and has a choppy transitional style. At the end of each chapter he offers a list of \\"to do\\" items that are sincere, but most often not possible for an individual embroiled in a troubled lifestyle or family. If it truly were \\"that easy\\" no one would commit homicide or suicide. I have nothing but praise for David Pelzer, he has overcome amazing odds, and in that way has truly been blessed. However, this book appears to be nothing more than an attempt to publish another book. Certainly a step down from his previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help Yourself","review":"Any book by this incredible man is worth the read, make sure your heart is ready to be forever changed.

Written by a Smithsonian acolyte who is both a longtime Smithsonian aficionado (as am I) and a practicing journalist, the individual chapters, which describe many of the institution's activities and exhibits, are supplemented with relevant and often revealing quotations, historical anecdotes and well documented photographs.The subject matter, which could be considered as a bit \\"dry\\" to present, is handled in a manner that will certainly be both entertaining and enlightening to many of the Smithsonian's 25 million annual visitors. My only reservation relates to the author's rather \\"singular\\" description of the Smithsonian's role in the distribution of early scientific papers, as though there were no other distribution channels available in the 1800's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Like a Charm!","review":"Even for a first timer, this inlay kit worked flawlessly as advertised.

The music is, for the most part, banal--an average evening of ballroom dancing on TV has far more musical life to it--and the pedestrian orchestrations and lyrics don't help.

It details the origin of Savvik's beginnings and why she was aboard the Enterprise with Spock. The author has an amazing talent to capture the detail and texture of the characters. It makes a good companion book to Star Trek II. While the author prefers Robin Curtis's performance in Trek III;it refers to her time aboard the Enterprise prior to Trek II. It's possible the plot about a Romulan ship firing while cloaked was used for Star Trek VI.

For good reason, The Gants have always enjoyed what seems to be a cult following in their home state, but in recent years that base has grown to include rabid fans overseas as well. Thanks go to Stevie Van Zandt and the Nuggets collections for re-introducing the band to lovers of 60's garage rock. If you are lucky enough you can still catch The Gants live as they have performed a handful of shows in the past few years, mostly in the Mississippi region. Lastly, this review is biased because Don Wood is my father and I grew up watching the band practice during the 80's and 90's, and they even let me sit in with them after I grew up. However, I didn't hear any of their studio recordings until I was 17 and it sounded like nothing I'd ever heard, even out of them during practice.

Where once the Beta Band produced an eclectic multi-instrumental mix of traditional song-writing and sampled-based structuring, they've now ended up playing vaguely annoying gonzo-idie-pop.Strangely, it's the dense mix of varied instrumental sound (that once made them so exciting) that hinders this record. Most instrumental parts seem laboured, too precise, lacking the laid-back slacker-energy of their early work.Steve Mason also has a pretty weak voice, and whereas this was once charmingly lo-fi part of the mix, his vocals are too heavily relied upon, and the monotone results grate more often than not.A once great band, with their best material now surely behind them: Go for \\"The 3 EPs\\" or \\"the Beta Band\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks inventiveness","review":"This is a band that may be losing it rapidly, which is OK cuz at least they made one great record. It wasn't this one: I don't get the very favorable respose to this album. To be fair, I haven't yet heard HOT SHOTS II, but will soon, because if there's a declension from THE THREE EPs to this latest, then HS2 probably has some good stuff -- and has to be better than the self-titled release. In other words, I thought HEROES TO ZEROS was going to be the answer to BETA BAND. Not. Just less frenetic and more streamlined, yet deperately trying to cling to their incredibly fresh early sound. That distinction got lost in the mix of the self-titled, and now it's trying to resurface through smooth but somehow muddy production along with boring melodies.

I didn't think much of it but now I think it's an indication that the power supply unit is on its way out.According to HP, what's broken is the Low Voltage Power Supply. HP won't sell it to me because it's not a user serviceable part. Sending someone out would cost me close to $900 just for labor. This is ridiculous.

The author of this book does a wonderful research job. The material shows both the good and negative sides of Operacion Pedro Pan, the children's own letters, and even their thoughts on the exodus forty years later, laudatory and condeming.

The novella is about a college student dying of AIDS who is attended to by his roommate. To pass the time, they invent stories about world events and an Italian family in Helsinki. We learn very little about the family and nothing about Helsinki. It is a good refresher course in 20th century events as well as the process of slowly dying, but it is surprisingly flat emotionally. I loved the second story, about a fellow visiting Washington, D.C. and happening on the premiere of a string concerto by a Vietnam veteran. The third story is nine versions of a letter sent by a prison warden to a mother describing the last hours in the life of her son. It exposes a range of possibilities as to how people might face their execution. I am drawing a blank on the final story after only two weeks, if that tells you something.

The last two stories in this book were written primarily using a word processor's copy/paste function, ergo they are a waste of time.I thought Life of Pi was great and deserving of the hype, so Martel isn't on my black list; However, this early work is less polished and shows only glimpses of his talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paragon TP-4 Theater Pop 4-Ounce Popper Popcorn Machine","review":"Product was as advertised, came very quickly, would buy from this vendor again.

Right away he is given a contract by a man, and is swept away to \\"the big time .\\" Though the boy becomes very wealthy and well known for his entertaining ability, he is also bored and unhappy. One day the little lad decides he has had enough. At the end you see the boy back performing at the park in front of a small crowd as you had in the beginning of the book.

When the Devil Dances continues the great series of the Posleen Invasion. (I recommend reading Gust Front first. That book is really a keeper). This is a bridging book in that the author admits that due to the distractions of 9/11 and his subsequent fame as a Fox and NY Times correspondent he simply couldn't get it(this book) to where he personally wanted to end.

It is also hard to believe that a centaur can breed faster than insects and develop or maintain any technology without opposable digits. You can't build technology with claws. Also unbelievable is that most of the U.S. would be overrun and nuclear weapons not used. A sixteen inch gun on tracks? Not likely.

You can read it alone and if that's the case you'd be surely tempted to read the previous ones...There's a lot of reviews telling what this book is about so I won't do that.

I'm quite willing to play that game, just continue giving me interesting characters in interesting situations, and I'll keep buying. But this book cheats. It meanders along for almost 700 pages with what are basically a bunch of subplots, some of which are fairly boring. The series' main character barely appears. A climactic battle is elaborately set up--and then the book ends before it happens. Ringo capped off the two previous books in the series with terrific, extended battle scenes. Here, he might as well have written on the last page: \\"HA HA HA, I sure fooled YOU!

If you want to use cardstock paper (80C/216 g/m2), you need to feed one sheet at a time in the manual tray, otherwise it'll jam. The color registration is off. It leaves a small row of colored dots on the paper. HP has replaced all 4 ink carts. three times already since Jan. It stops for a few ink impressions, but then starts again.

I only changed the black ink cartridge once and never changed the color cartridges - that's how little I used it. Yet I had constant problems with jammed paper and streaky ink smudges, and printing on any size other than 8.5x11 was a gigantic hassle. Then one day I tried to take out the black ink cartridge (because it kept smudging) and couldn't get it back in. Turns out, there was a little wire sticking out that was, according to the repair person, part of the frame, which can't even be ordered as a replacement part (so it was unfixable at any cost).

Don't waste yours unless you want to read a book full of corny quotes normally reserved for b-rated war flicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sleeper","review":"For those wanting to find stories of warriors this one has very few in it. Tucker can't help including every mundane detail about the soldiers he encounters as they are in camp or standing around, but has very litle to say about combat. Some of the dialogues he includes verbatim (esp. those of three Ohio reservists) read like an Ayn Rand novel--monotonous!

I boughtthis book yesterday and read it through; could not put it down. It is magnificent and really has unique, insightful views on how the Bush administration has fought, and not fought, the guerrilla war in Iraq. Mr. Tucker's deep operational experience in counter-terrorism and Marine special operations make thisa very unique work, also; as with THE LONG PATROL, his profound experience in combat gives the narrative a very sharp cutting edge which other writers of his generation just don't have.Tucker, like Hemingway, indeed, as other readers have said.Buy it, read it, love it, and cherish it: the Hemingway of our generation, Mike Tucker, really comes through on AMONG WARRIORS IN IRAQ.

And this is history:Tucker, alone, saw that the 82nd Airborne was on the tip ofthe spear in Fallujah, listened to his incredible sources inKurdish intelligence and US Army Special Forces, and thuswrote the ONLY account of the perilous raids against Al Qaedaand Zarqawi cells, and Iraqi insurgents, you will find.

The author tries to hard to be descriptive to the point of being plain dumb and confusing.

He gives nicknames to everyone he interacts with for some unknown reason but fails to describe the person and/or their unique personality quirks to make it interesting. Whatever the author does now for a day job is what he should stick to cause writing interesting and worthy narratives about our troops isn't where he should concentrate his efforts.

The writting is just poor. There are many incomplete sentences and paragraphs are often poorly structured and fail to convey any organized thought or idea.It is clear that the author has done some interesting things in his life and that he witnessed the hardships and sacrifices made by US soldiers in Iraq. However, without substantial re-editing, I cannot recommend this book.Finally, I must agree with some previous reviewers, this books rating has been trumped up by friends of the author.

Mr. Tucker is not a journalist, he is an author with a particular, pragmatic, point of view, born from his life experience. I'm guessing this experience enabled him to be accepted as a brother by the troops he lived and patrolled with for more than a year. In detailed accounts of the war told by the men who are fighting it, Tucker builds a very compelling case, not for withdrawing with the fight unfinished, or for staying in at all costs for some theoretical notion of middle-east democracy, but for winning the damned guerrilla war as soon as possible.

How many times are we told the stars are like those in the Karen Highlands? Over and over, things are repeated and it does not flow well. The author also makes some technical mistakes in describing arms and equipment that could have been corrected with a quick fact check so I have to knock it down a few stars.

I ran a series of tests, and then swapped with another brand of Firewire card. The other card worked perfectly and I could access the drive repeatedly without a problem. I contacted IOGear support and their response was that I should buy an external power source for the card and try that. I'm afraid I can't recommend this card based on its failure right out of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Specials-influenced ska from a cheeky Brit","review":"More genius from the very refreshing Lily Allen. \\"Absolutely Nothing\\" resembles a Happy Mondays track more than her typical sound, but \\"Cheryl Tweedy\\" is typical, with its great rhymes.

I picked it up at the library after hearing that he was an \\"interesting\\" author in a few magazine write-ups. I must say that I was pleasantly surprised.This book reads very well and VERY quick. The characters portrayed in the book are full of quirks, ticks, and other little nuances that add to their personalities. As the story moved on, I found myself laughing out loud at quite a few pages and at the same time, still being intrigued at the mystery. You don't find a lot of mystery books with a twist like that.Kinky Friedman succeeds in this book by not taking himself too seriously and at the same time tells an in depth story. Pick it up... you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not kinky's best, but good","review":"this book is the latest in the adventures of country star turned best selling author kinky friedman. it brings back the village irregulars (kinky's cast of crazy characters) & continues the friedman series. this book isn't about solving mysteries as much as it is about a unique outlook on life that is both humane and to the point. kinky's mantra is: if you can't laugh a little at life then there doesn't seem to be much worth living for. this book adheres to this addage and provides the reader with a fun trip in search of a young autistic boy who only says \\"shnay\\" while in persuit of a lost three legged cat named lucky. definately worth a read if you are just looking for something fun or if you are a returning friedman fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken after 3 months of use","review":"Well, at first the product seemed to work great. Then, it turns out that the little brackets that connect the transmitter to the outlet are not very stable. Within 3 months of not so excessive use, my transmitter is broken, the brackets swinging in the wind. I love the idea of this transmitter, I just wish it was sturdier."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"from the day i bought this it never worked well. at first i had trouble keeping a good connection in the cigarette adaptor, so i hard wired it into my car under the dash, but even with a good connection, there was always a lot of static on the radio, so i extended its internal antenna so that it was only a few inches away from the car antenna, while some of the static went away, it still did not transmit clearly. the music sounded fine, except for all the static in the background. overall i am very disappointed with this transmitters performance, but its looks and simplicity are nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I Received my copy and I have a hard time putting it down.The research is excellent.

It reads a bit like a detective investigation and is every bit as gripping, using published sources (newspaper, interviews, testimony) to draw the reader beyond the official explanation of 9/11.Suffice to say, Nafeez's conclusions are even more shocking than the thought of a terrorist net outwitting the CIA, FBI and military of the world's only superpower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educate yourself","review":"Ignore the dumb title because this book provides some very important context in a time of flag-waving empty-headedness. The author does draw many conclusions of his own, but mostly he simply corrals the best investigative reporting (much of it from major media sources), public testimony, and government documents into a coherent picture of why things went down as they did. The historical and political backstory provided is crucial to dispelling the apalling myth that we were attacked out of the blue and nothing could be done about it. The tone is incredulous and even-handed rather partisan or ideological. The facts presented in this book rocked me to my very core and left me mad as hell. (Compare the facts in this book to the 9-11 Commission Report and decide for yourself.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Book--Clears Up A Lot of Questions","review":"This book pointed to hegemony, oil profits, anda president's falling ratings in the polls aspossible major causes for 9-11 failures, notthe Massad. It's full of facts. If knowing thefacts comforts you, it is for you. The Israeliconnection is explored in a related website,the \\"What Really Happened\\" website. This bookdoes not deal with the Massad as a cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blaming the Victim","review":"Politically correct nonsense, unabashedly blaming the victim. To really understand the world and 9-11, you must read Victor Davis Hanson's \\"An Autumn of War.\\" Buy this book and the much smaller and much more profound Hanson book--read them both from cover to cover and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book title which is most apt","review":"If you are a foaming-at-the-mouth Bush hater, this is the book for you. It has enough red meat to keep you going for months. There is nothing in here which an objective observer of events as they occured could possibly agree with. If you want a book title that fully describes the contents, you need not even open the cover. This is a classic example of why political discourse in this country has become so raw. \\"Facts\\" which are substantiated by numerous references to nothing but rumor, repeated ad nauseum until it can only be called a polemic which declares war on freedom. I had thought that Oliver Stone's conspiracy theories were the ultimate in nonsense until I read this book. I must confess that I cheated and only read two thirds of it since the book could easily be condensed to thirty pages if the repetition were taken out.What a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Forewarned!!","review":"This book may appear to be a legitimate piece of journalism, especially with the rave reviews. But be forewarned that it is really a loopy, crackpot polemic that blames America and the Jews for September 11th.

Now ask yourself how many are told from the family dog's point of view. And how many Christmas stories can be told without using a word? The illustrator of this book is so clever, he tells a complete, very touching, story of the mysteries and joys of Christmas with only barks, yaps, woofs and yipps! Kids will love this book because it confirms their belief in Santa and all that is magical about Christmas, and they will also love the dog's antics. My seven year old niece loves the book and wants it read to her every night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT!!","review":"I purchased this unit and loved it and then it started throwing out very hot water out of the steam wand, then it shutoff and now its dead. I had it for less than a year. I purchased the SF-407 which is less than half the price!! It blows away this model. Read my review on the SF-407 and you will get a much better unit at a much better price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steamer","review":"The steamer takes a bit of getting used to, but it works well for all the shirts I had to do. It's easy to put together and steam comes out quickly and consistently. The only problem I ran into were the hard wrinkles that took 2-3 passes. But it beats a steam iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for 3 years","review":"I used this product for 3 years- about 3-4 times a week. I would say moderate usage. I went to turn it one one day and nothing. The light was on but nothing happened so I followed the manual and cleaned the mineral deposits which I shouldn't have had and a ton of black rocks came out into my sink! Anyhow, after cleaning it out, still nothing so I'm assuming the motor/engine whatever powers the thing is dead. I won't try to get it fixed as I am done with this model. Another thing I noticed is that when I would steam garments, it would deposit black stuff on my clothes. It did come out when I washed it but really... Poorly made if you ask me. It got two stars instead of one because it do the job when it wasn't spewing black and when it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was nice while it lasted","review":"I was happy with this product when it worked, but it didn't last long enough to justify the expense (in spite of the fact that I was very careful to follow all manufacturer's instructions). It stopped working on my first morning back to school, and as a teacher/mother, I don't have time for the last minute crisis it created. I'm looking for a better one to purchase, but because I didn't get my money's worth from this one, I'm worried about spending too much for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste money.","review":"It looks good and stable. But from the first time use, I experienced water leaking from drain and after several time use it stopped working. It took 7 months to fail. I only used distilled water.

Unfortunately, the auto shut off switch recently engaged (the steamer won't work) and the method of reseting it doesn't work. Thus, the steamer no longer operates. After speaking w customer service, my only option is to ship it back to the company. Perhaps I purchased a \\"lemon\\" but I'd recommend a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"steamer for sale","review":"This is my first time buying and using a steamer. It is also my last. It does not work well on all tpyes of fabric and I have a higher rate of efficiency using a standard iron/ironing board when it comes to the nooks and crannies of a shirt. I'm having a garage sale soon and this steamer will be the guest of honor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I'm a very dissatisfied customer. First of all, when the steamer arrived, the box looked as if it been handled by a gorilla. The product does not appear to be damaged, but when using it, it sprays large amounts of water all over the garments and the floor. It makes such a mess, it's not worth my time to use it. Good HouseKeeping screwed up when they put their seal on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked Heating housing in less than 2 years.

But after less than 2 year the casing to the heating element cracked and corroded. I am not sure how this has happened. We only use distilled water.It is disappointing since I would have expected something this expensive to last at least 5 years before suffering this type of breakdown under the worst conditions.Not all was bad. The product produced plenty of steam and worked flawlessly before the cracked housing. Heat up time was fast. The hose and handle were cool to the touch.Unfortunately I now have a useless steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"I only gave this 1 star because it wouldn't let me give zero. Ordered this steamer to use for my daughter's wedding. One bridal gown, veil, 7 bridesmaids dresses, and my MOB dress. It only made it through one dress when it stopped heating. Switch would light but it wouldn't heat. The rush charges at a dry cleaners exceeded the cost of the steamer! Amazon was great in handling the return and refund. Not impressed with the SteamFast company. Not what I needed the day before the wedding."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Sierra Carry-On Wheeled Backpack is the best!","review":"I recently purchased the High Sierra Carry-on Wheeled Backpack and it was exactly what I was looking for. The Removable Day Pack served as my personal bag and stowed nicely under my airline seat and the Wheeled Backpack stowed in the overhead compartment very nicely. It is the perfect size for travel. Its sturdy construction will make it a valuable item to have for quite sometime. Both bags have straps to use as backpacks.Excellent product at an excellent price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry on suitcase/backpack","review":"Overall, it's a good product.

I am sitting in the airport looking at the seam which has ripped out and I still have another flight until I get home. It also falls forward when I put my laptop in the zip-off backpack. I spent $80.00 on this piece of trash. Oh - and It doesn't fit in the overheads in smaller aircraft unless you unzip the backpack. Then you have 2 pieces of carry-on which is the limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice piano jazz standards","review":"I'm a fan of NPR's \\"Wha' Do Ya Know\\" and always enjoyed the show's piano jazz segments.

So much of what she has put forth is the foundation of more recent work and it's all good, it's all very good. This book is more like a synopsis of her larger 400 plus page book \\"The Dynamic Laws of Prosperity\\". I often read it as a refresher when I want a quicker read. Both books lift your spirit, offer valuable wisdom and confirm that you are capable of manifesting what you truly desire. Catherine Ponder books will always be in my personal library and I am grateful for them. I cannot recommend this book enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"All of her books are good. I bought all of them. I read her books from time to time.

I have read other Catherine Ponder books and truly believe in her philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Moravian Hymn Heritage","review":"It's dense! Rev. Adams gives you a lesson in meter, rythm and rhyme. Then he talks about how different translators can change a hymn. He spent years researching in the Moravian Archives in Bethlehem, PA, in order to write this book. He even audited German class at Moravian College to brush up his German. Meticulous research as to which tunes are of \\"true Moravian\\" heritage or borrowed from other sources. Not dynamically written, but chock full of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bitch in the House: 26 Women Tell the Truth About Sex, Solitude, Work, Motherhood, and Marriage","review":"An angry book that is not a pleasant read on the whole, some essays are angrier than others, mostly involving hatred of self, their mothers and men. Hysterical and moody, not worthy of respect from this reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing, Nice to know you aren't alone in your feelings","review":"First of all, I have no children, but it is refreshing to hear from women who have gone before me having the misgivings of giving up freedom and independence for marriage and children. This book is above all about how life isn't perfect, but I think that it still did a good job of showing the trials as well as the the joys of life from the perspective of women who have gone down different paths. This book is filled with essays, many written by some of my favorite authors. I recommend it highly. One word of advice is that you need to be able to put this book down. Read an essay or two and then wait a bit and read a few more. I can understand that it might get emotionally exhausting if read cover to cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"According to this book, the everywoman in America is a neurotic, passive agressive professional writer. While I'll grant that the stories were interesting and did ring true for me in some aspects, I ended up just being annoyed that the editor failed to seek out more diverse women with more diverse professions for her book. Couldn't she have found an engineer, a black woman, a Latina to chronicle their stories? Hanauer started out with lofty goals in her introduction, but didn't end up meetig them for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"no sympathy here.","review":"This book sounded like it would be terrific -- women talking about things women tend not to discuss. However, it wasn't at all what I expected. The contributors are mainly upper-middle-class magazine writers, which means that the pieces all tend to sound the same, and have a real feeling of entitlement. Too, there are almost no older women/women of color/etc.I actually preferred THE BASTARD ON THE COUCH, because the men seemed a lot more dimensional than their wives (if as shallow)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bitch in the House","review":"This book is a great find. The Bitch in the House made me realize I am not the only woman who thinks and feels the way I do. This book brings out the secrets of being a mother, wife, daughter, sister, friend and exposes them in black and white. This book redefines the \\"normal\\" for my generation. Thank you for putting it all out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhh....can I have my money back?","review":"I apologize in advance that this review will not be very helpful to anyone, but all I can say is \\"Can I have my money back?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Spend The Money","review":"While I agree that the essays were well-written and interesting, I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that this book was annoying and \\"the women made their bed now lie in it\\".Maybe because I'm not married and don't have children, I can say that I do not understand their frustrations but this is obviously the path they chose. My advice to the authors is GROW UP!!! Who said life is easy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break ladies","review":"This book, God, was full of what men can't stand about cranky, complaining, PMSy women... Too many emptyheaded romance movies from Hollywood have turned these women into complaining maniacs. Maybe they should realize that movies have a PLANNED SCRIPT and are NOT REAL. And for the lady who nearly choked with anger because her boyfriend wouldn't buy her some imported cheese, God lady, if it means that much to you buy it yourself. What a lousy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Resonant collection of essays","review":"A friend chose this book for our monthly book group and I wasn't sure, from the title, how much I'd like it. After originally checking it out of the library, I ordered my own copy because I LOVED it and needed it permanently on the shelf. The essays are honest, thought-provoking, and varied enough to be relevant for women at almost any time in their lives. They capture much of the tension of conflicting ideals of femininity in the twenty-first century -- the convergence of the expectations of \\"the angel in the house\\" and the ambitious career woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying","review":"With a few exceptions, this book is a collection of essays by cranky women. I found many of the essays to be completely embarrassing. Some of the writers must have felt that way too, because they wrote under a pseudonym. What is it with writers, anyway? It seems as though they have all been in therapy, can't commit, and complain about the most superficial things. One woman complained about the fact that her boyfriend wouldn't spring for imported cheese. She made a good living and felt she was entitled to imported cheese. Several women claimed to love their independence, but then complained about the lack of a man in their lives, and then finished up by admitting to having pushed away anyone who expressed an interest. What do these women want? This book was unsatisfying and I am sorry I wasted my time reading it. Good riddance."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time to read","review":"This book was a waste of time for three reasons.First, I have enough stress in my life and I don't need to hear or read about the stress of other women. I have to do a lot of reading as it is and don't need to come home to do more reading from women who couldn't cut it.Second, if you want to stop being a b.... then take a vacation or take some time out to just do nothing. You don't need to read this book to realize that. Usually when we take a step back from our life we can put things in a larger perspective and move on.Third, these women are too stuck on themselves. If you feel you have to experience the problems of others to help yourself, volunteer at a non-profit -- that way you'll see real world problems and be helping someone else at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitch and whine","review":"All these essays are fairly interchangeable. All the women seem to be white professionals, all left-leaning academics/writers griping about their complicated lives. There's a sameness to all their narratives; even the one by Ellen Gilchrist, a writer I admire, is suprisingly flat. No humor, no variety, no lightness of touch anywhere--just the self-absorbed ruminations of spoiled, earnest women who've bought the line that they can,and deserve, to have it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is feminism?","review":"I bought this book after reading a review that suggested it would be essays about how various women cope with jobs, kids, husbands, etc. Since I'm one of those women, I thought it my might affirm my own experiences, or maybe enlighten me to new ways to approach various problems. Nope. These women seemed to be whiny, upper-middle class women who are very proud of their intellectual accomplishments, give their husbands no credit whatsoever, and are very angry that their husbands aren't mind readers. Some of them also seemed pretentious. I mean, although some of the reasons one woman gave against marriage were perfectly valid in the abstract, can anyone really say \\"marriage is a tool of the patriarchy\\" with a straight face?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"Thank you, Ladies, for writing this book. You are exactly why I will never marry an American woman and why I have advised my nephews and younger brother the same.I was exhausted halfway through the thing. While I had dealt with my divorce, this book has kindled in me something I would never have expected concerning my divorce from the woman whose very breath I loved. That something is nothing less than ecstatic joy at being free from being tied to an American woman.Hard, driven, cold, lacking natural affection for their own children, often focused on proving they are as sexually active as a man would like to be, LOL, as if that is a good thing these women portray the American woman as totally devoid of affection or morals.Don't worry ladies about committment, no one would want you for more than an evening's distraction anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about the children?","review":"Madam's whiny book ignores natural law, as well as the time-space continuum. What? One can't work a full-time, professional career, have mentally healthy children, and be a super-mom? How disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny self-indulgent women bitch and moan","review":"I am betting they are all alone now if they haven't grown up. Except maybe the Indian one. The 1-3 star reviewers hit the nail on the head. Only a saint or a masochist could tolerate their whiny crap. Read it if you need to get depressed. These 'ladies' don't want partners, they want mind-reading fairy-tale man-slaves to cater to their every whim. And even then they wouldn't be satisfied. I feel for the men in (probably no longer) their self-centered lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The essays ran the gamut","review":"I read this book for book club and the essays ran the gamut from being just like who I am or women I knew, to women I couldn't even understand. It was a fun and easy read and gave us a lot to talk about at book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The book is a total waste of money. But at least the title is appropripate. It seems to perfectly classify the writers. The stories are negative, whiny and depressing. I do not have time for this kind of garbage! The stories are far from uplifting. I bought the book after reading some positive reviews. I thought that I would purchase the book and share it with my friends and daughters, maybe even buy them a copy. I don't know anyone that I care about that I would give the book to. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting to all War veterans","review":"My husband is a Vietnam vet and we watch all the war movies. We love Saving Private Ryan, We were Soldiers, Platoon. They are real war movies. This movie was just filth. It insults all marines to think that this is the way they act. We were very disappointed with the movie and I am upset I spent the money on it. If you want to watch a good war movie, try any of the three I mentioned above. And don't forget to pray for our troops."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"MOST TERRIBLE MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN! THERE WAS NO PLOT TO THE MOVIE. THERE WAS NOT EVEN ONE SHOT IN THE MOVIE.

Too bad such talented actors had to make a movie and bring themselves into the gutter.If our military acts like the characters in this movie, we are in deep trouble.RLHOLMES"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cursory view of war","review":"The movie was sort of a cross between M*A*S*H and Saving Private Ryan. Parts were funny and light, parts were quite difficult to watch. The characters were developed enough to cause the viewer to care, but not so much that we didn't wonder more about them. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jarhear Letdown","review":"Jarhead started out good and showed how the troops went through training with the mental and physical struggles both during training and in Desert Shield and Desert Storm.The letdown was that there was absolutely NO fighting!They had a great buildup to a big fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious, Unrealistic & Lame","review":"Maybe the book was better, but the movie was pretentious and very unrealistic (I'm a veteran). Apparently, this guy reluctantly becomes an elite sniper even though he'd rather be doing nothing at all. Then he goes to Iraq and almost does something but then doesn't. Somewhere in there he and all the other marines strip naked and jump around. Yeah, sure, okay. The remainder of the movie is filled in with shots of walking through smoke in the desert cuz the oil wells are on fire. Again, nothing actually happens. A complete joke of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"tc","review":"The bottom line for me, a retired Marine, is that this movie is an insult to all Marines. Unfortunatly due to location I purchase my movies... this one is for traget practice as I will never watch it again and would not want to pass it on to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"depressing, but well crafted","review":"This is a uniquely depressing war movie. Worse than the trials and tribulations of the individual j-heads is the overpowering implications of a military based on cult allegiance to the exclusion of all else. Hopefully there is artistic license employed to exagerate beyond the realities within the marine corp. An international audience will find this disturbing and a fine fit for propoganda, while a domestic audience will be left shaking their heads.The photography, acting, dialoque are all well done. The march through the burning oil fields is totally surreal, and a scene from one of Dante's deeper levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A likeable movie","review":"I have watched numerous war films and seriosly thought there would be some kind of enemy battle in the second part of this film.. nothing! This is certainly different for a blockbuster. Another thing, is at times it had a documentary feel to it; which is fine by me. The main thing is that everything worked out well with the good news that they(troops)were going back home. That was reason enough for them to celebrate, drink some booze and be thankfull; good for all of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"USMC Deserves Better than This","review":"TEDIOUS - I could not finish watching this film. My husband, a former Marine Infantry Officer, rented it. This movie tried to be an update of Full Metal Jacket with Swofford as the Joker character. It fails except in its stereotypical portrayal of Marines as a bunch of sexually obsessed, masturbating loosers. Puhlease. A decent soundtrack but a waste of time. Watch Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket instead - a better soundtrack.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The jar is empty...","review":"This plodding film attempts to \\"shock and awe\\" the viewer with its depiction of the U.S. Marines as unstable, anti-social, bloodthirsty thugs, and tries to impugn the United States' actions in Operation Desert Storm as motivated by oil company profit.I realize the viewer is supposed to be shocked by the scene in which the soldiers are hooting and hollering with excitement while watching a violent scene from Apocalypse Now, but all I was thinking was how much I'd rather be watching that movie too, instead of this dismal wreck.For a much better look at the dark, disturbing side of the American military, watch Apocalpyse Now, Full Metal Jacket, or even Three Kings. Don't waste your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Once more Hollywood proves that they are out of touch with the real world. Does anyone who has seen the movie and actually served on active duty really think ANY military personnel act like this in a combat theater? If they do its the rare exception, not the rule. Scout snipers must be some of the most mentally stable individuals in the world. The nature of the job demands it. The movie would have you believe the USMC would let a bunch of borderline psychos run into combat with hangovers, virtually unsupervised, carrying loaded M-16s and grenade launchers. As a veteran I can tell you I seriously doubt it.After seeing this movie I won't be buying the book. Save your money. If you want to see an awesome DVD about the realistic horrors of war get \\"Band of Brothers\\" about the war in Europe or read \\"Into the Rising Sun\\" and \\"Beyond Valor\\" about WWII in the south Pacific, but don't believe all of this modern Hollyweird crap they're putting out these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Most stupid movie ever. All a load of garbage and not even entertaining. Hollywood liberals ran with this one to make our Marines look like idiots. I served during Desert Storm - this is not even good fiction. No redeming value. Please don't waste your time - you will be dumber for watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring war/military movie I've ever seen","review":"Jarhead follows Jake Gyllenhall through marine bootcamp, through training as a sniper and being sent to Kuwait in the first Gulf War. We watch him get chewed out, worry about his girlfriend cheating on him, fight and party with his marine brothers, go crazy with boredom in the desert and finally get to go on a mission.If all that sounds boring, it is. Nothing interesting happens in this movie. It's 70 minutes into it before the war even begins and then, still nothing happens. Even when he finally gets a mission, it's dull. The scope of this movie tries to be a Full Metal Jacket for the Gulf War generation but fails in the sheer pointlessness of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Of The Worst War Movies","review":"This is one of the worst war movies that I've ever seen.Pretty boring and there was no plot and no character development.There was no point to this movie.Not much going on so the movie dragged.In the begining it looks like it might be a decent movie but it quickly went down hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service Great movie","review":"Great movie the acting was top notch. The service was the best I actually got Jarhead two days earlier than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good.","review":"I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of all the mixed reviews, but I am hungry for HD material so I watched it. It turned out to be a pleasent surprise-realistic story, good acting, good dialogue. However, don't expect to see a war movie with lots of combat action-most of the movie takes place during the buildup prior to the Gulf War. Also, while the boot camp portion of the movie is good, it can't compare to Full Metal Jacket. The HD DVD transfer is one of the better ones and the sound is top notch as well. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"The Suck,\\" the movie","review":"In the book that gave rise to this film, one of Anthony Swofford's Marine buddies refers to the Corps as \\"the Suck.\\" That pretty much captures the author's love-hate relationship to the Marines. And \\"suck\\" is what I think about this adaptation of Swoff's fine memoir.Jarhead the book is a cerebral exercise that dissects the hilarious, pointless and terrifying experience of joining, training for and being a warrior in the US Marine Corps during the first Gulf War. Jarhead the film extracts the small amount of action in the book (except, sadly, for the prodigious bouts of drinking and screwing) and plops them onto the screen, drained of humor, emotion, irony or context. No comparison to the power of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't watch.","review":"This is propaganda. I would give it no stars, unless they were red ones. Al Queda could not have done it better. It's no coincidence that Hollywood made this into a movie. They want to trash the Marine Corps in particular and all of the armed forces in general.

They picked Jake Gyllennhaal to be Anthony Swofford? He looked horrible for the part and looked like a pussy and I hate Jake Gyllennhaal too his acting is terrible. Why Donnie Darko being in the role of Jarhead? He's really a strange actor. This movie was really too long and I was bored with it. I was ready to leave during the middle of it. It was more like a rip off of Full Metal Jacket. You will be disappointed. The trailers looked amazing but the movie sucked ass. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really wants to be Apocalypse Now...","review":"If you want a war move that probes the depths of madness and incorporates surerealism while exploring the lives of soldiers trapped in a pointless microcosm of a wider war, you have two options. Get a pretty lame and boring variation on this theme in Jarhead, or get Apocalypse Now. The later is the infinitely better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful movie!","review":"If you want to see a war movie without any action in it then go ahead. I didn't see any action at all. They are mainly just training at war and searching for something in desert storm. If you want to see it that bad then wait for the DVD but don't go waste money to see it in theater. The actors did a great job and everything. I especially liked Jake Gyllennhaal's performance as Anthony Swofford he did an excellent job and so did Jamie Foxx but the whole movie just sucked. Do not waste two hours watching this movie it's a complete waste of time. I felt like I was watching a rerun of Full Metal Jacket but anyways you will be disappointed do not see it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been better than this!!!!!!!","review":"i give this mess two stars for the try at something meaningful here,but they missed the boat! jake gyllenhaal and jamie fox are good but the screenplay is underwritten and the movie is just not up to the task of telling it's first gulf war story. the action is few and far between and what passes as development of the charters is just not worth the time you have to spend watching this foulball movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overated, boring nonsense","review":"Don't waste your time. Marines sit around and act macho while waiting for war. Pass this by, get Full Metal Jacket, Boys in Comapny C or Black Hawk Down instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe war movie","review":"This is a dull movie that would have been better as a series of shorts. The whole thing goes back and forth between \\"humorous\\" and \\"serious\\" scenes, and you're never really sure what the movie is supposed to be about. You never care about any of the characters either - most of them are portrayed as drooling idiots when they're not spouting off dialogue that sounds like it was created by some sort of generic army talk generator. Worst of all is the soundtrack. Everybody Dance Now? Are you kidding me? It's like listening to a mixed tape made by someone who owns every volume of Now: The Hits.Jarhead tries too hard to be deep, with its trippy visuals of burning oil wells and dramatic naratives, but by the time the film is over, absolutely nothing is said. Jarhead is just a wannabe war movie that even references Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter while ripping off Full Metal Jacket. Too bad because a good cast was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mom's Opion...","review":"I ordered this for my son & I watched it the other day & I won't go into long details seeing there are plenty already,there are a few pretty funny bit's & some naked Butt shot's which was ok by me,but I must say it wasn't what I expected it to be,if U can get it for a buck or less it might be good just for a few laughs as long as U don't mind hearing the word Masturbation about 50 times.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waiste of my time and money","review":"Went to see this movie last night expecting a war movie about the US Marine Corp. Instead I saw a movie about a bunch of nut jobs that had escaped from a mental institution. These guys were falling apart before the fighting even began. This was a movie to slam our recent efforts in the Gulf area. It was a slam on the US Marine Corp and it was a slam on the military in general. I will give you all the same advise I sent my son who is in the USMC - do not waste repeat do not waste your money. This was a bunch of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"jarhead","review":"i have always been a big fan of this movie...the grittiness and the uglyness of war seems to be captured...it almost feels as if it is a documentary, but we know its not. for people like myself who did not get to serve our country, it give us a chance to see how the marines live, eat and protect our wonderful country. a must see for any war buff, jake gyllenhall or jamie fox fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wierd.......","review":"to have have a movie about a war that is happening right now. Don't get me wrong I enjoy war movies. But most of them are about WWII. I don't like being reminded of people in Irag and Kuwait actually dying as we speak. I sensed this movie was a little bit too pro war. It's just my opinion. The casting was great but the movie wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WON'T WORK!","review":"Jarhead is clearly an UNSUCCESSFUL attempt to embarass Marines and former Marines. The mission is to deter those interested in serving their country from enlisting in the Marine Corps. Don't support this anti-Marine Corps sentiment. Don't buy the book or a movie ticket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior DVD","review":"Halfway through the DVD it started to stop and start throughout the second half. I will not buy anything else from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story that doesn't need to be told","review":"Maybe this is a case of a really good book made into a bad movie...I don't know, but when all was said and done with the film, I was left sitting there wondering why on earth was this even made into a movie? It's completely BORING. Some are saying boredom IS the point of the story. Well, hell, I can sit around my house and leave my front door wide open indirectly inviting maniacs to enter my home, but if a maniac never comes, should I write a book about the experience of waiting for something to happen???? This film might appeal to some intellects and they might even see something artsy about the story, but for the average movie goer, skip it. If you're a movie maker and you have an uneventful plot, at least give some depth to your characters and some enjoyable dialogue. I've enjoyed people's private home movies with kid's birthday parties more than this. What a disappointing snooze."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SELF INDUNGENT LOAD OF COW MANURE","review":"This movie doesnt even closely resemble reality in the Marine Corps. It brings dishonor to his service as a MARINE."},{"rating":"1","title":"this sucks","review":"This has to be one of the worst military related movies. Whoever made this abonation please learn a little bit about the military and about events that occured in the gulf war before you make another movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucked!","review":"As for the trailers it looked amazing and wanted to see it and thought it would be worth the money. I got my ticket and I can't believe my ticket was too much and it costed $10.00. I saw it and there is really no fighting at all. All of it is just training and bombs falling on the ground. Jamie Foxx and Jake Gyllennhaal's acting are great but the whole movie sucks. You call this a war movie? It seemed more like a comedy than a war movie. Too much disturbing languages and too much masturbating. The trailers really ripped me off. I can't believe I wasted my money to see this. Please do not waste money to go see this. The whole movie is boring. If you really want to see it bad wait till the DVD comes out do not see it in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your off your jarhead if you liked this movie","review":"For one thing, I don't like to see a war movie without the war! Next, after 21 years in the military with several male-bonding opportunities, including forty years as an avid athlete showering with teammates, I NEVER had a homo-erotic thought! The less-than-one-percent of our population that sways that way obviously includes the author, Swofford. I also figure the buddies in his unit are a might uncomfortable reading his book. Otherwise, the movie was well-acted and well-done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"This movie is a big disappointment when it comes to a portrayal of what it means to be a Marine. As a former Marine, I found it insulting and to say the least lame. The film portrayed marines as being a group of adolescents whose sole activity consisted of masturbation. Whoever wrote the sript obviously had no idea of what it was to be a Marine. The casting of Foxx as a Staff sergeant whose vocabulary consisted of one word, which is unprintable here, was the pitts. If you want to see what it was like in the old days, then see \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" or the \\"D.I.\\", those were the good old days when they separated the men from the boys in the first 3 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ron C is clearly still in high school","review":"Ron C as a real Marine I will tell you, we spell our CORPS CORPS!!!!!

A definite purpose to the story. There WAS NO STORY!

There, now you know the entire jist of the movie and you were not bored to death for two hours like I was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"welcome to the suck","review":"I asked myself. Why?

All the guys do is hang out at camp and run around the desert. The never even shoot at an enemy. Not ONE SINGLE SHOT. It's also a rip off of Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Jarhead even copied Full Metal Jacket's lines. If you go to rent a war movie, and you come across Jarhead, spit on the box and rent a different movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassments all round.","review":"Where to begin with a film so full of verbal and visual clichés? Taken from Swofford's cynical memoirs, Mendes goes to town with the usual \\"grunts as foul mouthed dupes thrown into war by capitallists\\" routine. The language is gratuitous except to convey how Hollywood thinks recruits and PFCs behave. Drill sergeants have long been prevented from slapping recruits but here we go again with scenes showing the supposed brutality of the system.Mendes thought he had the raw material for a great war movie. He doesn't. And it looks like he gave up trying halfway, throwing around liberal and literal plagiarisms from Apocalypse Now, Three Kings, Full Metal Jacket, The Hill and Deer Hunter. It's pathetic.For the acting, Chris Cooper phones his performance in and Dennis Haysbert wanders in from another movie. Only Peter Sarsgaard emerges with any credit. An actor to watch for but not in this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Supplemental Disc is better","review":"I give this dvd 2 stars only because of the second disc.

It is full of every idiot cliché that could be crammed into a movie of this type. The private standing up and getting machine gunned in training is a vey old stick. Fact is that I've done the old low crawl across the course while machine guns fired overhead and small charges of C-4 were set off and I did it at night. It's more \\"fun\\" that way. Didn't anybody panic. And no, we were not elite soldiers - just a bunch of ordinary guys going through Army basic in 1963. That sadistic staff sergeant in movie - what a crock. Yes, there are Army and Marine sergeants who are tough on the people they command. However, the actions of the staff sergeant in the movie was so far out of realty as to be pathetic. About the only good part of this movie were the scenes of \\"grab ass\\" and the stress of doing nothing. The rest of it was pure male bovine droppings and a disservice to the marines.

Is perfectly size for a single gun, but there are larger one for more or bigger guns or used for storage of anything of value and needs quick access to them. Easily mounts anywhere, in closets, under a desk or in a cabinet or even in your car.With the easy programmable codes on the 5 push-buttons, it make for a very quick-draw without having to strap your gun to your hips. With the dead-battery by-pass feature, you don't have to worry what to do, when the batteries goes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died upon arrival","review":"My wife bought me this model for Christmas. It was recommended by a friend. It looks good and all, but I installed the batteries, input my code twice like it said and everything looked good according to the manual. I closed the lid and it latched just fine. Then I tried inputting my code again and... nothing. No lights. No nothing. I tried the external contacts and it opened using the default code. I took it back to the retailer where I bought it. The guy there tried fresh batteries but could not get it to work.I'm not saying they're all bad. I'm sure lots of people find them to be exemplary products, and the guy I returned it through even said they'd sold dozens and this was the first bad one.He offered to trade it for a working unit, but I said no. I mean... if it does this right out of the box, imagine how much fun it will be trying to get my gun when the damned thing dies in an emergency. No thanks. The safe I keep my gun in must be AT LEAST as reliable as my gun is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gun Safe","review":"This is the perfect bedside safe, the small one is too small for a full size 1911 frame but my 45 ultra carry fits perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was fine for a few month but ended with a big problem.","review":"I had this safe for a few months, everything was fine until one day I was punching in the combination and smoke came out of the box and it stayed closed, I tried to use the battery on the external contacts but safe still didn't open. This safe has no key, to bypass an electronic lock, for such an emergency so I spend quite some time opening it and getting my stuff out of it, after I was done only thing I could do its to throw it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for one small frame pistol","review":"Price was great and I was happy to get free shipping also. I couldnt find anything with the features and price in my local area and you could spend a lot more on the web.This thing works fine. The opening for the door is kind of small and I even have to tilt my Steyr M9 to get it in and out, but fits fine once inside. If you want to have roomy, easy full hand access, you should look at something bigger. The reset button was rather difficult to locate when programming the code. The instructions dont give the best description of where to find it, but after that no problem. I did not mount this or bolt it to anything. I figured being in here gives me quick access to the weapon but if someone grabs it, it is just a heavy thing to hit someone with."},{"rating":"1","title":"money out the window","review":"I bought one of this and when it arrived it would not open to put batteries in so I called company the said I needed original factory code I said never had batteries in it OK will send shipping slip for return with new one. Three weeks later new one arrived but after 2weeks could not open and nine volt would not over ride so used my Randal knife to pop open door to get weapon out and the Homak went to recycle. Would have helped of had been advised about keeping the factory code in the original info, should have shopped for one with key over ride this was a bad choice on my part and would not use any of the Homal line as I have talked with others that have had problems with their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Homak won't help you if it dies.","review":"I purchased this less than 2 years ago, and noticed that once in awhile the solenoid lock wouldn't release. That should have been a red flag from the beginning, but I figured it was low batteries or something. Well a couple months ago it completely died. It took me over 80 tries to finally get the solenoid lock to release (using a fresh 9V battery) so I could at least get my gun out. Sure enough, now the box has that distinct \\"burnt electronics\\" smell. Heavy duty container, but cheap electronics.I emailed Homak customer support several times over the past several weeks, and no one ever got back to me. Clearly they are not interested in fixing these boxes.Had there been an intruder in my house, I could have been dead. Needless to say, I will never EVER buy another Homak product. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to go","review":"All the concerns I had about this unit where put at eas when I recieved it in the mail. The non key over ride I was worried about is addresed with an external pos / neg battery attachment point if the bettery goes dead. The unit is stout and would be difficult to enter. The only problem I had with the unit was the lack of holes drilled in the center of the back for mounting to a single wall stud. The unit has four holes one in each corner so I drilled three consecutive holes in the a line from top to bottom and put three larg screws into the wall stud. Also I would get some self adhesive fuzzy side velcro to cover the screws to resist marring your hand gun. I liked this unit so much I have purchased two more to place around my home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"The safe works out of the box like it is supposed to. I guess that's the good part.The problem is that the 3 1/2 inch model is way too small to hold anything larger than a compact gun. My Glock 35, which is admittedly a large gun, could not even fit through the door, even after trying several different twists and turns. I suspect this small safe would be useless for most any 1911 style .45 caliber handgun as well.I was impressed with the lock mechanism, but it could definitely be 100% improved by a backup mechanical key lock and buttons that light up similar to a cell phone.If you are in the market, skip the small one and go for at least the medium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke upon delivery","review":"I received this unit with one of the wires disconnected similar to one review posted that complained about wires and battery pack being exposed inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, fits in drawer - holds 1 gun","review":"I bought this as a bedside solution for my gun. I have small kids in the house and couldn't keep a gun by the bed without some kind of lock box. This model (6683) is small though. Fits a sub-compact handgun and maybe would fit a slightly larger, but not by much. Fits very nicely in a small drawer though and is just the thing I needed. As some noted, it's not a safe, but a good little lockbox. I like the battery failsafe on the outside too.I also bought a mid-size (6684) model. It arrived today and the door won't latch. It's a couple inches deeper, but since I am returning it, I am just going to get the larger one. I would think you could put th larger one under a bed or in a closet, but not in a drawer. Only the small, maybe the mid-side are for drawers. They all just the same door panel/code component, Homak just attaches a different depth box on them each.So, though 1 of 2 has a problem, I'm still buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gun safe for the AMAZING price!!!","review":"I don't know WHY the picture that Amazon shows for this gun safe is wrong...the real photo is the smaller safe that Amazon has listed as HS10036685 (which is 10\\"x14.25\\"x7.5\\" - a much larger safe) - I am VERY pleased with the size of this safe and it will hold both our Glock 27 & My S&W; 38. I STILL can't believe the price...the box is very solid in construction. I am having trouble setting up the code so will probably call HOMAK to see what I'm doing wrong but besides that I am VERY thankful to have a place for my gun to go out of \\"small\\" hands! I HIGHLY recommend this gun safe!!![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe for Handguns !!!","review":"First, I question the quality of a product that right out of the box does not work. It would not lock which is due to the flimsy electronic latch not closing firmly. It obviously bypassed quality control in the overseas factory where it was made. Second, had it locked properly, I believe it could be easily pried open with a screwdriver. Finally, it does not meet UL Home Security Container Requirements or the DOJ Home Security Container Standards, which basically means it has serious security flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent safe for the $$","review":"Like many others who have written reviews for this safe, I purchased the safe to give my wife and I some comfort while leaving a loaded handgun accessible while our kids and our kid's friends in the house. What good is a gun for home protection if you can't keep it close and loaded? Our kids know gun safety very well - but I would still never leave a loaded gun where they can get to it. Build quality is very good for a steel safe. I have had it for a couple of years now and I replace the batteries at the same time I replace my smoke detector batteries (twice a year). I would highly recommend this safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small interior","review":"Since the keyboard intrudes into the interior space, the dimensions do not reflect usable space (there was no room for my .38 special).The 9 volt battery external contacts in case of battery failure is a good idea, but when the keyboard malfunctions one day, be it a year or ten years, there will be no way to open the safe short of a pry bar or saw."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is my dad and his friends YEAH!!!!!","review":"If you dont buy this CD you are a very stupid person.

From start to finish, every song, on this CD, is sung with the passion and vocal mastery that only the Whispers can bring. If I could, I'd give it 'Ten stars' , instead of the five stars I'm allowed . If you're a 'true' Whispers fan, you'll love every song on this fantastic CD. This CD was well worth the nine years we've waited for a new recording from this mavelous singing group. For the young men of today, if you want to know how to 'Sing ' , this is the CD to listen to.

This cd is solid from start to finish, however if you came looking for 8 minutes epics (circa~Three Days) you have ventured into the wrong domain. What you get here is striaght ahead rock n' roll flavored with JA twinges of surf-punk-and funk. The bottom line is nobody sounds like JA, they do not try to imitate anything...they are who they are...love it or leave it.Stand out tracks for old school fans - Price I Pay, Strays, Everybody's Friend, To Match the Sun.Solid return from a band that was sorely missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album but Copy Protected","review":"This album is copy protected so you won't be able to play it on your MP3 player, on your computer (without their software which didn't work for me), on some Car stereos and even on some home stereos!Tell them what you think about this sort of thing by taking your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is great, CD Control is garbage","review":"This is one of the best albums I recommend you never buy.The music is bliss; powerful guitar and excellent singing. However, the copy control means that you likely won't be able to play the music as you'd like. I listen to music on my iPod when I travel or exercise, and I am unable to transfer the songs to my mp3 player. As such, it's a useless buy for me. Don't buy this album, as the only way to fight against companies like EMI is to hit them in their bank accounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music, if the CD will play","review":"I'll be brief.

Perry Farrell's odd yet mesmerising wail is here along with Stephen Perkins powerful and overlooked drums. The true standout is Dave Navarro who unleashes a guitar tour de force not heard on his solo album or the Red Hot Chili Peppers album he played on. I dock this album one star because the band is missing one of it's stars: bassist Eric Avery. Eric wrote all of the original tunes and this album is missing those lumbering bass riffs that nearly defines the Jane's sound. Nevertheless, with all of the absolute crap that's out there right now...this album is a NEEDED reminder of how a great band can ROCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An island of hope in a sea of musical diarrhea","review":"One can only hope that it won't be another 12 years between \\"Strays\\" and the next release from JA. Where they were one mighty alt-rock gods, they are now giving notice to all the... \\"nu-metal\\" vets like Bizkit and Linkin that there is a better way to rock. There is more to music than just attitude, although Ferell & company have plenty to go 'round.From start to finish this is a tight disc. \\"Just Because\\" is guaranteed to get you moving, \\"Price\\" runs the gamut from high to low and the most underrated track on the disc is the title track \\"Strays\\". It slowly builds before delivering a sonic boom.\\"Strays\\" shares the boom and crash of \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" but the arty side of \\"Ritual\\" makes it's presence felt from time to time. This should be on your \\"Have to get right now!!!!\\" list if you have even a passing interest in JA."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad...I think I put my expectations too high.","review":"Upon first listen...I was dissapointed...but give it a chance.They've grown quite a bit as musicians...and it's been over a decade since their last album.Many of the songs sound similar to each other, but they are good.See them live if you can, they're unstoppable."},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad...","review":"As many reviewers have already noted, Jane's Addiction was one of the great late 80s early 90s bands. I'd like to give JA the benefit of a doubt--maybe they're going in a direction I'm just not willing to follow, but to me, the songs on this cd sound uninspired, generic, flavorless and overproduced. What's particularly depressing about this is that all the players obviously still have their chops. They just don't have anything to say. Still, I wish them well--if all JA had done was \\"Nothing's Shocking,\\" that would be more than enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"This is my first Jane's album and this thing just rocks. I know a lot of hardcore fans complained this is nothing like their previous works but who cares when it's so good?? And this thing this is blissfully angst-free, unlike Velvet Revolver. My friend burned me a copy of that and it's way overrated and full of angst-ridden cliches, musically and lyrically.The whole of Strays is just damn catchy, yes catchy! The only ponderous dud is Suffer Some, I guess they had to make a concession to the moshpit brigade, but the rest is excellent. Buy this now, it's the best rock album I've heard in ages. And so happy you can almost see Farrell grinning all the way through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"To put it plainly - THIS ALBUM SUCKS! This was so not worth the wait. It lacks many of the essential elements that truly defined Jane's sound. I'm not asking for another Ritual, or Nothing's Shocking, but where's the ingenuity? Where's the innovation? The songs on this album sound like they were slapped together with the \\"hit song\\" formula. Maybe they did it for the $. Perry's solo stuff is way better than this and so is PFP's. I hope they get it right next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the f***","review":"this sucks, i cannot believe that a band that gave us 'classic girl' and 'then she did' could slump to such a low.

Then they put out a cruddy album, tour and make money, go into the studio with a bunch of better songwriters, and become pop icons.If your brain is thinking \\"Aerosmith\\" right now, you're correct.However, Jane's Addiction is NOT Aersosmith.For a reunion-type album, this is excellent. \\"To Match The Sun\\", \\"Strays\\", \\"Suffer Some\\" - this album is full of great songs. Not as Jane's-y as the other two studio albums, mind you, but Jane's nonetheless. Not just because Perry Farrell is singing; the writing somehow sounds like a more-mature Jane's Addiction. And make no mistake, I absolutely loved their other two albums. This is a great surprise, as I was expecting a less-than-valiant effort from them, but now I find myself eagerly anticipating anything else they put out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is their best Album Ever.","review":"I am 27 and was never a huge fan. I respected their music and understood Jane's Addiction had their own unique sound but I always felt their songs kind of sounded the same from \\"Been Caught Stealing\\" on back to previous albums.This is the first album that has their unique sound but they actually grew up and progressed. This album is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I never thought I would ever say that about a Janes Addiction album but it is very impressive. It was the first time I've actually listened to an album that I can say I've rocked out to in years and listened to all the way through.The songs will start off in a beautiful mello cool bluesy way then go into this awesome rock symphomy or start off rocking from the bat.

I \\"discovered\\" Jane's Addiction before anyone else I knew, before Nothing's Shocking was even released.

We'd talk about the lyrics and try to duplicate the guitar riffs until we were too drunk or our fretboard fingers hurt too much to go on. Gone are those days. Jane's started their downward spiral when they released Ritual. They weren't completely done then, but there were inklings. Perry had gone off the deep end, and after several more years of too many drugs, so have the rest of them. In a word, this album sucks. It has no life to it. It's just flat, boring, and worthy of nothing other than the \\"used\\" bin at your local record store. Don't waste your time or money. They used to be cool. They just aren't anymore. Not even close.

It's like trading in your Coke for Jewel Cola. Ain't got no right, right Jane's?? This is what you get when a band goes away in their prime, then comes back for the pity encore.It's like watching Deion Sanders coming out of retirement, he's alright, but he ain't no Neon Deion.

But I guess you can't blame them since they have cleaned up from the drugs. Honestly, they used to make such better music when they were under the influence. I think it's safe to say that the old Janes is gone and this is what we are left with. It's funny, the more I listen to \\"strays\\" the more I want to pop in the older janes albums. I was dead wrong when I initially thought it got better with repeated listenings. It really doesn't. I just caught a couple of good sound moments here and there and then realized, this doesn't even come close to the depth and sound of the old Janes. If you are big janes addiction fan, you will probably be disappointed as I was. There are, however, a couple decent songs and that hint back to their trademark sound. It just doesn't hold up to my expectations of what a Janes Addiction album should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a few listens","review":"This album isn't going to change anyone's life, like so many fans have claimed the earlier albums had.

They're better than just about every band out there. But if you compare this album to Nothing's Shocking and Ritual de lo Habitual, Strays sounds horrible.Was Eric Avery really THAT important? Maybe. Look at the songwriting credits --- unlike the old albums, these songs weren't written exclusively by the four original band members. The producer and members of Porno for Pyros are credited as co-writers on most of the songs. Maybe that's the problem. The music is watered down and over-produced. A few songs are good (Just Because and Everybody's Friend) but the majority are extremely bad (like Superhero and Hypersonic).At this point, Jane's Addiction is a brand, not a band. They cashed in and stopped taking chances. If you want generic hard rock played well and perfectly produced, buy this (and the self-titled Audioslave album too)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but...","review":"I don't write long, critical reviews, so here's what I think. The album is definitely good, the new bassist sounds compatible, but it is a happy version of Jane's Addiction. Maybe they don't have any reason to be sick and angry anymore. Still recommended; after all, they remain something unique in the business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of a useless album","review":"Jane's Addiction was a great band of the early '90's. They had their hits and their odd little gems and they DEFINED alternative. Everything about them from their music to their dress to their lyrics screamed out loud, \\"the freaks are taking over, join us!\\"...Then they went away and a lot of people forgot what they were all about. That is what Jane's Addiction was banking on when they made this album, that nobody would care if they had nothing to say, that the name of the band alone would conjure up some jagged memories of a society desperately stuck between the Reagan era and our cellphone culture. Money must have run out for these guys, 'cause they sure didn't have any other reason to come back...at least the music sounds that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Janes Addiction or Bust???","review":"I tried; I really really tried to get into this album. After much anticipation I flew out the door to buy this new CD hoping it would deliver, sadly it does not. When I talk about delivering it is coming from an early Jane's fan. My first concert was at 15 and when I heard Ocean Song, and Ted Just Admit It I thought I saw God. I am not trying to relive the past with the CD, sadly I think Jane's Addiction is. I was hoping for a new revolution, but it wasn't much different from the trying to be indie rock I hear on the local radio station. I will give it a few more listens before I shelve this CD; although I think I have already done that, I guess I don't want to fully give up on a band that had near life changing meaning for me. For the newly acquainted Jane's fan, please don't hold it against them for the die hards well..... keep hoping for the revolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have stayed disbanded","review":"Wish they left well enough alone....This album tarnishes the great music they made over a decade ago.

Maybe Janes just shouldnt have bothered. The main ingredients in this lackluster album are warmed over riffs, mundane lyrics and an absense of the charm that made Janes Addiction a classic band. Only the excellent single, Just Because rises to the stature that the bands previous material set. The first few songs are alright, but is this really the band that changed popular music less than 20 years ago? Strays makes it apparent just how important departed bassist Eric Avery was to the songwriting of this band. Who knows, maybe this is a sound that will bring Janes more commercial success than their previous records, but as a longtime fan, I found this to be a huge letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Addicted after all these years","review":"What happens when you put 3 out of 4 guys who made a couple great albums over a decade ago together again? They make another great one. Some songs creep up on you, and not every song on this CD is a classic for the ages, but there are enough of them. My favs are Strays, Just Because, The Riches, Everybody's friend, To match the Sun, and most of all - Suffer Some - arguably the best song they ever made. If you liked the first two Jane's, you'll like this one. Now if we could just make X come out with a new album too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was So Afraid That \\"Strays\\" Would Be A Huge Letdown...","review":"...Thank God I was wrong!Strays isn't the best CD in Jane's catalog, but after waiting for over 13 years for a true successor to Ritual De Lo Habitual you have to be impressed by it.The disc does continue the trademark sound of Farrell and company without sounding like they took the easy way out and cloned previous efforts. The songs are all new (FINALLY!)and Jane's Addiction appears to be serious in their attempt to come back as a band with still more to say.The grooves are still there even though the drugs are gone. Hopefully we won't have to wait another decade for a follow up because \\"Strays\\" is powerful and worthy of purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Welcome Surprise","review":"I came across this album by \\"accident\\" (didn't realize they had a release on the horizon at all) and couldn't have been more pleased by it. As a long time JA fan, I've missed the magic that the band creates. Perry Ferrell sounds great- and the music is incredible. It's one to crank up in the car and drive long distances to listen to over and over.Each song transitions into the next. And while a lot of it doesn't follow traditional JA style, it's a true graduation into the next realm of JA. So glad to see them back- and so disappointed that I missed Lolapalooza this year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pull up bar!","review":"I didn't need to install the bar with screws.

It does take some time depending on your door way to get the sides to reach your desired width. Very Sturdy once up. Great Price. I think this is better than others. I mean what else do you need? The hand grips do not move, so if you dont extend the other side, your hands will be off center like one suggested in the review, but again, just extend the other side lol. Would highly recommend. Works great. Oh, it also comes with some fixtures to hold it in place if you dont trust it without. I have been using for about two weeks now without it and its still up very sturdy.

Although this book didn't have the sensual and erotic power of Chocolat, I found it very enchanting. I attribute quite a lot of my experience to the fact that I decided to buy my first book on tape and listen to it in the car on my long drive to the Cape and back.

This is the theme upon which Harris's new novel is based. The critics are saying it's about returning but it's really about self-pity as well as self-aggrandizement. Every time a problem arises, Mado races to the rescue (probably in an effort to prove to Dad that he should have loved her best)And if that's the point, then Harris failed to show me that the issue was with Mado and not with Harris herself. This felt like a first book. You know the ones--thinly veiled autobiography where the author airs a tired old grievance. And because of her past success, her editor and the critics let her get away with it. She also got away with my money and now I have a grievance to air."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this one","review":"It's rare that I don't finish a book.

Fan is heavy and hard to work with, and directions suggest ancient system of a mounting in wood (are you kidding?)rather than more common fan support boxes. Took lots of effort to balance--what is up with that? Trial-and-error system of observation (which wobble is worse after weighting?--not measurable!) Finally, measuring from ceiling revealed the blades that were best candidates for weighting (installer's idea--not in directions, and wouldn't have worked on angled ceiling.) Next step would have been taking off light fixture and trying blades in different positions--oh, that's efficient! And this was installation with someone whose done dozens of these through the years. Also, wish I'd taken more note of the review mentioning light strobe effect--it's unpleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!","review":"These fans look really nice in our family room.

I've always been happy with Hunter fans. They balance easily, are quiet, and have never failed me. The metal piece on the bottom of the glass has the holes in the wrong place causing the pull chain for the fan to bind. I contacted Hunter by email and sent photos - but never got a response. I corrected the problem by drilling new holes - but you shouldn't have to do that.

As with the eight piece set, these drivers are of exceptional quality, made in Germany and built to last. The tips and the shanks are made from high quality steel and the handles themselves are absolutely excellent. They have the perfect shape and they are smooth without being slippery or easy to lose your grip on. Because they're hard handles, they won't pick up too much dirt and they'll be very easy to clean.I highly recommend Wiha torx drivers, in particular this 'Powerhandle' series. I really like this particular style of grip/handle and the red color only makes it better.

But This is not Focus anymore. Sins Jan Akkerman left the band (u all know why), other guitar players replaced him. That's of course not possible sins Akkerman is a unique guitarist and composer. He is also a sound designer. A inventor. It's terrible to see that Van Leer is trying to keep holding the old original (Akkerman) sound by forcing good guitar players to play like Jan Akkerman.

(check out the YouTube clip for an example).Also, the instructor is annoying in this vid in how she has yells gruffly.I would not recommend buying this Vol 3 Bollywood Style video.However, I would recommend Vol 2 Hip Hop Style which is has much better camera angles of footwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roland Boss BR-600 DVD Tutorial","review":"Somewhat helpful but not for beginners.

All the movements are simple and effective. You don't have to think all that much, which is really good for those days when you really don't feel like working out and don't want to have to concentrate.

Francine is very to the point, technical, and definitely lacking in humor (unlike Sylvia). I suppose that is why I found it completely boring.

Go and rent the movie DOGMA and learn that is the idea of God that keeps the world alive not the belief. A belief such as you have is dangerous and keeps you close minded.

If more people opened their hearts and minds to receive this kind of message, the world would be a much better place.

The author is so disorganized that she constantly repeats her ideas, usually in the same words. She has obviously done no historical research, and does not find it necessary to use well known facts intelligently, even when such facts are readily available. It is hard to believe that she has had muliple works published. Her meandering thoughts are what I finally concluded could be defined as \\"Catholocism through the looking glass\\".

I also do not believe that God would seen us here without Angels, or spirit guides or some Hope of KNOWING about the LIGHT. It just proves to me the first thing I was told by my angels and guides. \\"Be careful what you choose to believe.

I read \\"The Other Side and Back,\\" and thought it was excellent and right on target. However, \\"God, Creation and Tools for Life\\" disappointed me. I cannot recommend the book overall, although it has several positive and helpful messages. The discussions of light and dark entities and the way suicides are treated in particular do not ring true to me. These ideas do not resonate with the message of Love and Hope that are embraced in the book. Every one finds the light eventually. All I can say is beware of letting others do your spiritual work for you. Your own intuition will tell you what is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"lies,lies and more lies","review":"Sylvia Browne has come up with fantasy and managed to pawn it off on alot of uninformed people as truth. She quotes the Bible, but totally twists the meaning of what the Bible says. She does not believe that Jesus died on the cross so that we can have eternal life. She is a pyschic and the Bible clearly states to stay away from pyschics and mediums. She mixes a little truth with alot of falsehood and outright lies. She believes in re-incarnation, which the Bible does not teach.A book that exposes the New Age, that I recommend is by Johanna Michaelsen. Her book \\"The beautiful Side of Evil and \\"Like Lambs to the Slaughter\\", expose alot of these lies.I pray for Slvia Browne, because I know God loves her and everyone, but He doesn't want any of us to be deceived and that is what she is doing.Check out the stopsylviabrowne website to see all the predictions that did not come true that she has made."},{"rating":"2","title":"When the past will not let us rest.","review":"Sebold had been writing The Lovely Bones that begins with the rape and murder of a young girl, when she found she had to stop and write this book. She had been raped , and \\"lucky\\" to have survived it. In the reactions of her family, law enforcement, and the rapist himself, Sebold found the lack that she needed to survive the attack in her heart as well. The writing is honest and without an attempt to justify herself. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The irony of \\"Lucky\\".","review":"\\"Lucky\\" is Alice Sebold's ironically titled rape narrative. Her blunt and frank recall of her assault are daunting but - as she notes - she is \\"lucky\\" to have survived. While not for the faint-hearted her story is important. I recommend it to a broad readership because it poses questions about violence, family, law, punishment and recovery. I liked the truth of this biography and its pacing. Although there is another rape narrative near the end, it added nothing to strengthen the core theme; the book would have done well without it.Personalized, micro-histories of this sort offer valuable opportunities to understand, interpret and feel what are too often vague, anonymous news articles. Sebold's direct style courageously stares this kind of crime straight in the eye without blinking. It is a solid read and a valuable story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting in places. A great learning tool.","review":"While I can't say I loved the subject of this book (rape & violence) I'm glad I read it. It is an excellent book and well-written. The book was upsetting in the fact that it was true. It set off a lot of buried feelings in me. I am always amazed and impressed by women who go through things like this and come out whole on the other side. There often seems to be an underlying unfairness about the way rape victims are treated by law enforcement and some members of society. I read the book in one session, as I couldn't put it down.This is Alice Sebold's story and I admire her bravery in sharing it with the rest of us. I would recommend this book to anyone mature enough to understand the subject matter. There are probably some teens who would be able to appreciate and learn from it. Others may be too young, so I would suggest parental guidance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesomely Grandtactular!!!!","review":"The book, Lucky, was a good book for all people. It was a real detailed novel. It made me think about how I present myself to others and what could happen when I am alone. Even though it is a true story, a lot of girls will turn to the novel for reference and support. I rate the novel, Lucky, 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review","review":"Sebold does an excellent job telling the story of her own rape with enough distance for the reader to feel develope his or her own perspective, while simultaneously explaining her innermost feelings. Unlike many other stories of rape, she leaves the reader in the understanding that despite how far she has come since the actual rape, it is still something she deals with on a daily basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Since I really liked \\"Lovely Bones\\", I was so excited to read another work by Alice, especially since it got such great reviews.

So well written, it is a bit to graphic for schools to require. My daughter was given this book in her junior year in high school to read for a class then required to have class discussion and do a review for a final grade. She was uncomfortable with the graphic, real and scary story and asked to be given a different book to report on. Though rape is a scary reality, I feel that some books should be left for each individual to choose to read. This book is not a book for public school to require. For all the parents out there who are not aware of your schools reading matterial, please take the time to be aware in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit sophomoric and too angry for my taste...","review":"I found Alice's story interesting but her presentation sorely lacking. There was almost a misanthropic feel to the entire text, as though she always hated people, men especially, and being brutally raped was the perfect excuse to case her hatred of the human race in a book and sell it. I felt sorry for what she endured, and I applaud her courage and bravery in recovering from that traumatic event. I didn't care to hear about her entire childhood and bizarre relationship with her parents. I just felt that she wandered endlessly, and didn't stay focused on the story that was truly hers. Sadly, this is not one of the better memoirs about rape/sexual assault. There just isn't enough substantial material in the author's life to fill 250 odd pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably Unlucky","review":"All I could say when I was reading this book was: \\"God help me,\\" It was horrible. I had just come off of the cusp of The Lovely Bones (Which was breathtaking beautiful) and I greatly looked forward to reading her first novel. I was quickly sorry for that longing. How could an author stray so differently. This was just a yawn through of her rape to which to projected unrealist characters (her family and friends) while she gave off the aoura that nothing was wronge and then all of the sudden she would burst into tears and we- the reader- would have no idea why. The chapter with just the rape in it was captivating, but that's pretty much it, and toward the end theirs a courtroom chapter that drags on forever and is completly dry when it comes to feelings and emotions. I can only hope that when Alice Sebold's next book comes out that it swims into the same vain as The Lovely Bones and not this strange and dry work that was its predecessor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort!","review":"I did not walk away from this book feeling moved and blown away like I did the Lovely Bones. I know this is her personal story but I don't think she captured the emotions that she did in the Lovely Bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triumphant","review":"In 1980, as a college freshman at Syracuse University, Alice Sebold was brutally raped as she walked home through a park one night, and the event profoundly marked her life from then on. In this powerful memoir, at times shocking and other times humorous, Sebold recreates the event that scarred her life in grim detail, and recalls the decision she made to find and pursue the conviction of her attacker. With the help of her poetry professor Tess Gallagher and fiction prof Tobias Wolff, she was able to identify the man who robbed her of her virginity and left her physically and emotionally damaged, and to testify at the trial that sent him to prison. The opening chapter, in which the author details the brutal attack on her, left me crying, and the remaining chapters read like a gripping suspense novel and a triumphant account of justice. A powerful, moving read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"Lucky is a thought provoking book that helps readers understand rape from the victim's perspective. Written in an honest manner, it explores the rational and sometimes irrational reactions of everyone involved - whether victim, friend, or family member.Seabold opens the book with a vivid description of her brutal rape. Initially, this makes it a difficult read because it forces readers to live through a brutal act. However, it also helps to expose a reader's preconceived notions and biases. Seabold describes her struggles to return to a normal life and she honestly discusses societal issues that favor the criminal and penalize the victim. This is a good read for anyone looking for some insight into a difficult issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read....","review":"Alice Sebold wrote a very powerful memoir. I did at times find myself skimming pages to get on wtih the story. I found the ending to be a little disappointing though. I think Alice fell short at the end. It is almost as if she was tired of writing and just ended it. I would have like to have heard a little more about how her drug habit started and more on her life up to the point of writing her memoire. I do hope that Alice comes out with another book. I have shared this and The Lovely Bones with friends and family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important reading","review":"I finished this book last night, but I'll be thinking about it for quite some time. When she was 18 years old, Alice Sebold was raped. Obviously, the event changed her life. \\"Lucky\\" is the story of the rape, the trial and how both affected her life. It's disturbing and graphic, but I think that was necessary. After reading the book, I was amazed by Ms. Sebold's strength and intelligence. Although I can't understand what she's been through, I think I can imagine it a litttle bit. Maybe that was her goal; to have me see her as a person rather than a victim.I also think I can see some of the origins of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" in this experience. That book has become even more meaningful to me after reading this one.\\"Lucky\\" is not an easy book to read, but I think it is worthwhile - in the telling for Ms. Sebold, and in the reading for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like hugging pain, raw but beautifully written","review":"Lucky is the truest portrait one can paint of tragedy and justice in minds, bodies, and spirits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrifyingly Detailed","review":"Sebold tells the story of her being raped at 17, its aftermath, the case, and how it affected people surround her and the rest of her life - socially, sexually, emotionally.The horrifying details made me cringe in disbelief, but she does it without imposing too much drama - matter-of-factly as if she's detached from it.She actually suffered from the trauma for many years and didn't even realize that. She went through it all and journeyed the recovery. And the brave soul finally found home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heroic and Painfully Real","review":"I read the 'Lovely Bones' before reading 'Lucky' and I must admit that I was initially skeptical reading 'Lucky.' However, Sebold's account of the rape and her experience reveals that she is strong, yet human. The effects of the experience lingered with her long after it occured. In addition, it is quite enlightening to see how her personal experience may have influenced her \\"fictional\\" writing in the 'Lovely Bones'. What a therepeutic mechanism for overcoming such a devestating event!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...","review":"This book was a good read. There were moments when it was incredibly intense, but other moments were you feel like you are wading through the words. I was crying into the first few pages, but I thought I was in for a lack-luster ending when I reached the last chapter of book. Sebold pulled through that though. The ending was not as it first appeared to be headed, but wasn't quite up to the level of the rest of the book.However, I applaud her for writing this memoir. I could see it helping a number of people. We all have our own stories, and these stories do mold us through out our lives. I know this all too well. It's encouraging that she was able to turn such a negative experience into a driving force and not allow it to diminish who she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Startling and Memorable","review":"I read The Lovely Bones prior to reading this memoir, and together these two books make for a powerful journey that crosses the lines of fiction and memoir. By itself, Lucky is a startling and sometimes horrific survival story. Alice Sebold describes her violent attack and the subsequent events in painful clarity. I found the descriptions of her family's and friends' reactions to be both disturbing and painfully real. After reading the book I was left with disgust of the judicial system, fear for young women on campuses everywhere, and respect for a talented writer who is able to cut through \\"Law and Order\\" type detail and tell her story with the perfect balance of heart and mind. My advice? Read them both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning to rape survivors","review":"This is a well written book that brings the reader along and allows them to feel like they are living out the story. That being said, it was a really hard read for me.I am a rape survivor, and this book brought out a lot of feelings that I thought I had left behind me (with the help of plenty of counseling!). My situation was completely different from Ms. Sebold's, but it seems that many of the feelings associated with rape are universal. I felt revictimized for a few days after reading the book. Also, I had to take many breaks while reading because panic attacks would come on during some of the more intense moments.This was a great book, and I don't want to discourage anyone from reading it. However, I think that it is important for other survivors to know what they are getting into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"I found this book on my kindle, which was recommended to me after reading The Lovely Bones.

When most girls in her situation kept quiet and felt ashamed, Alice does the opposite. I felt a little cheated with how she described her life after the trial though. I finished the book wondering if her life is good now, or if she's depressed, alone, and suffering from substance abuse problems. I can't wait to read Lovely Bones now and see how that book compares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky","review":"The book arrived in the expected time frame I was told. It was in very good condition.

Sebold's use of a stripped down, matter-of-fact tone desensitizes her story. Though her rape was a traumatic event, I couldn't feel for her. Perhaps it was her intent not to draw out feeling to avoid pity but personally, I think it was uneffective in conveying her complete story because a memoir needs an emotional plot as well.I wanted to put down this book before I was even half way though there were still many unfinished subplots like the conviction of her rapist.I would expect this book in the children's/ preteen section if it weren't for the detailed account of the rape."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"Alice Sebold is a great author, but when it comes to this book it lacks in excitment and is over detailed.

This is a superb account of our high school days as well as our geographical area, and I read the rest of the book with great interest. Although it's not likely I would have even picked up the book had I not known the author, it's a great read, and tells a very unsettling tale from Alice's very unique point of view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful...meaningful book!","review":"I read Sebold's The Lovely Bones before I read this. I was very anxious to hear the real life story of the author's real life rape and how it affected her life. I was not surprised to find that, like The Lovely Bones, Alice Sebold knows how to write...and she does it well!The rape description and courtroom drama are extremely gripping. I had a hard time putting this book down. I also found her life after the rape was described so well and deeply touched me. I had never thought much about how rape may affect someone in their later years, and Sebold beautifully describes every detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brave but Re-traumatizing","review":"I began to read this book thinking that it would be interesting and a good read but it had a difficult affect on me. As a victim of rape myself I found it to be quite retraumatizing and I am trying to work out if I should work through it and continue to read or to put it down. It has already opened some pretty old wounds. It would almost be good to have some sort of disclaimer on the book so that the reader is prepared.

She starts her story by recounting the event in graphic detail, and continues the tale in the same frank fashion. Nearly as shocking as the opening chapter are the reactions and actions of certain members of the police force, her family, and fellow students. That she was able to keep a level head, in spite of what she went through, in her attempts to obtain justice is a testament to her mature mental state. Ms. Sebold story, told with frank forthrightness, shines a shockingly bright light on scary situation. Equally interesting: Even Silence Has an End by Ingrid Betancourt, I Am the Central Park Jogger by Trisha Meili, and The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this book was so well written and had such a powerful impact. alice sebold has outdone herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironic Title","review":"Lucky...was she really? I'm still reading, but so far, very good. The rape scene was so well written. You could almost smell the filth of the area that the assault occured.

Very well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"monotonous","review":"After reading many of the great reviews here, I was eager to get my hands on this book - I rushed to Borders and bought it brand new. The first couple of chapters were great, but then I lost interest. Still, I continued reading in hopes that the story would pick up pace, provide more personality and emotions. Instead, I found the tone of the book to be dull and boring. I gave up reading after page 145 (out of 243 pages). I had more fun in traffic school than reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was OK","review":"The story was a good, strong story, but the read was so sloooow.

I was really looking forward to reading it only to find that the grammar and spelling mistakes fill this book so badly that I could not even stand to read it.

This book was so drawn out and pathetic. She made the bad thing that happen to her effect her entire life. Move on, a terrible thing happened to you ok we get it. I think there was a total lack of subject matter, blah, blah, blah so, what else and then there was nothing. A true disappointment after Lovely Bones.

This riveting true story is not so much about the horror of the experience, but the recovery from it. Most revealing is how her friends and family responded to her after she became a rape victim. Insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"As a Syracuse resident, reading this book was all the more difficult because Sebold does such an excellent job of bringing the city to life. Not only did I feel \\"there\\" during the attack, the investigation, and the court scenes, I now look at my city in a completely different way. The beautiful amphitheater at Thornden Park is now foreboding, the cultural center of Westcott darker, somehow. That is how real this memoir is. Alice Sebold sucked me into her world in 1981. This memoir was nail-bittingly intense, and, at times, poignantly funny. I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this because the blurbs said \\"triumphant\\"","review":"But Alice (in her own words) was not triumphant. After being raped as a reasonably well-raised 18-year-old college freshman, Alice spent years as a heroine addict, 10 years with undiagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, and many, many years unwell. Not a happy life! Not even now does she seem to be well.As a recent rape survivor who had this book handed to me, please allow me to suggest that this book is NOT a good choice for those recently raped."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is a one hit wonder...","review":"I hate to say it, but I LOVED the lovely bones, not impressed with this book. Did not keep my attention and she skipped around A LOT. It is wonderful she can write with such clarity about such a painful experience; however, the actual book, not that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale of Determination","review":"By now, most of you have heard of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" ... a movie which started as a book written by Alice Sebold. If not for her quick-thinking and clever strategy of getting into the mind of her attacker, Alice would never have had the chance to write The Lovely Bones ... instead she would have become them. This book is the story of her own brutal rape as a freshman at Syracuse University, an act she tried very hard to forget but which became her driving force for justice, and then for a spiraling descent into the lowest moments of her life. If you've ever wondered about the dirty little secrets entwined in this crime, Alice reveals them all ... even the bad side of justice as we learn about the revenge rape of her friend, whose friendship she ultimately loses. As someone who was nearly raped by a man with a knife, I have always wondered \\"what if\\" I hadn't maneuvered my way out of that incident. Alice's story gives me closure, and I now realize just how \\"lucky\\" I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unforgettable memoir","review":"It took a great deal of courage for Sebold to write this memoir, which describes her brutal rape as a college student and the subsequent investigation and prosecution of the crime. In spite of the incendiary nature of the crime, Sebold remains largely an objective and composed storyteller, describing events in a detached and methodical manner. It's actually a very interesting true crime story that is hard to put down. The quality of writing is excellent, too. Overall, a very engrossing read. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky","review":"Page turner could not put it down, great read, I love all of Alice Sebold. This lives up to her talent.."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful and personal","review":"This book was brave and from a personal perspective it spoke to me. She was honest and not a bit of this memoir is inaccurate. It spoke to me personally, and I hope to everyone else who has been a victim of sexual assault or knows someone who has been. This type of crime does indeed shatter a person's life, and sometimes recovery takes a life time. She described her journey so well, and I am glad she was brave enough to write about it, and share her experience. Many victims of crime, especially rape and sexual assault, feel alone and unable to face what happened to them. let alone go to trial and write a book. Mrs. Sebold sets a great example for other women, and demonstrates there hope and recovery after something as traumatic as rape. I especially appreciated the information about PTSD, since I have dealt with that disorder in my own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be essential reading for college women","review":"While not always pleasant to read, I found Lucky more compelling and much more likeable than that drivel-fest book, The Lovely Bones. Lucky is a blunt first-hand account of surviving rape, and its long-term effects on the victim, including physical and emotional trauma and, consequentially, its indirect impact on the victim's loved ones. I'd recommend it to all women, if not for reading pleasure, then at least as an eye-opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Memoir That Reads Like a Novel","review":"Thankfully the success of Sebold's novel The Lovely Bones has brought her previously published and equally well-written memoir to light. I actually read Lucky first, and was amazed at Sebold's ability to gain insight from her real life experience and put it to such great use in her later work. Equally impressive was Sebold's amazing ability to recall and recount in such detail the experience of her rape and its aftermath. The reader learns much about so many aspects of a survivor's experience, including the impact on relationships with family and friends, the challenges within the legal/criminal justice system, the emotional/psychological ramifications, and just what it takes to truly SURVIVE such an experience. An inspiring read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky: A Memoir","review":"I found this book very interesting. I have never read a true life rape account. Sebold is defiantly a champion to not only decide to not lose her sense of humour but to fight the rape charge and win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky to have read Lucky","review":"Last year my son gave me THE LOVELY BONES for my birthday. I was most impressed with how the author was able to be funny with such a dark subject; brilliant.This year my son gave me LUCKY and I was blown away by the author's ability to move me through the horrific experiences she endured and feel somehow I too had triumphed over trauma in the end.And lastly, I grew up in Syracuse, my father and nephew graduated from S.U. and I bought pizza and a leather purse on Marshall St. I am older than the author and somehow felt guilty that while this was happening to the author I was possibly eating an icecream cone and unaware of her pain.Outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"victim's life slows regains footing after brutal crime; great read","review":"Alice Sebold was raped during her freshman year in college. One can think of this as just a statistic because, undoubtedly, a great many eighteen year old girls are raped. But the author expertly describes how this event affected her. One might think this solitary event is (hopefully) followed by a singular period of recovery, albeit perhaps a very long period of recovery. I've learned from 'Lucky' that this simply isn't true. One's psyche/soul takes a windy, unpredictable path after experiencing such brutal trauma. Alice Sebold describes her path very clearly. Tough reading, but I think this is perhaps the best memoir of this sort I've ever read.Bottom line: although the subject matter is likely to turn off prospective readers I suggest 'Lucky' be required reading by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey for the Soul","review":"Hook: A poignant memoir written by Alice Sebold telling her story of rape, violence and how it transformed her in the person she is today.In The Lovely Bones, Sebold takes the reader on a journey of rape, death and the many shades of loss involved with both. This book is shocking, dramatic, and long lasting.In Sebold's second book, Lucky, she takes us behind the curtain to reveal her true story. In 1981, Sebold, an eighteen year-old coed attending Syracuse University, was raped. It was an act of violence that has become the theme to Sebold's existence still today.With writing that can only be described as gripping honesty, you won't be sorry you picked this book up and you won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on a tough subject","review":"\\"Lucky\\" is a recounting of the rape of Alice Sebold, who was a freshman at Syracuse University when she was raped. It is a graphic, detailed account of the rape itself, as well as her life in the days and months after the event. Sebold is faced with speaking with her family, professors, and friends about the event, and carrying on relationships with others, while still carrying the fact she was raped. \\"Lucky\\" shows a rarity among rape victims, as Alice Sebold pursues the case and rapist, trying to get him off the streets and in jail. \\"Lucky\\" is an extremly detailed, interesting book that paints the realistic story of the rape of a young woman and the changes in her life afterwards. Strongly recommended by me, but also, a slight warning for those who may be a bit disturbed by the graphic details of the rape."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that gives you hope","review":"After reading this book, I really do feel like I was given a bit of a gift, of hope. No, I haven't been raped, but just to know that someone who went through such a horrible thing and has come out on top, though struggling still I'm sure, is wonderful! I think it gives us all inspiration to move beyond the things that have held us down or hurt us. This book was a bit more than just Alice's rape- it was about her life, her family, her friends. It didn't overwhelm you with too much dialogue or pure reflection on the rape. This book is really a story. It's simple and pure. A read that I think I'm a bit better for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's got some uses","review":"The 16-day workout plan and the exercise tutorials are good.

I used to use a giant C-Clamp (about 5x heavier than this spreader, and more awkward to boot) to push the piston back in on my disc brakes. Now I use this spreader, as it's a little simpler and easier to use.Just stick the large metal piece in the brake, take one of the old pads and place it against the piston, and tighten the spreader until you begin pushing the piston back in. Just be careful to not push too far (which is easy to do with this spreader, since it's so easy to screw in compared to my C-Clamp), or the gasket around the piston might squish out in a weird way!Best of luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discombobulated","review":"The writer assumes that the reader is familiar with the artists and their muses. Mentions Dodgson and Carroll in the same sentence without saying they are the same person; the village of Cadaques without indicating which country it's in,etc. The chapters follow no timeline, jumping back and forth, describing events that preceed something previously mentioned. I mistakenly thought it was biographic, but there is a lot of the author's opinions and impressions in the text, guiding the reader (The careful reader will note that...), so that they arrive to her same conclusion. May be enjoyable by someone who already knows the protagonists' lives but not for someone trying to learn something for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Low\\" Lives of the Muses","review":"This book aimed to sell on its claim to fame which hinged upon the juicy account of the lives of 9 femme fatale who purportedly launched the careers many great men in history. This book sucked precisely because these \\"juicy\\" accounts teetered toward tacky sensationalism; the writing no more refined than tabloid-style prose; and the manner in which the author attempted to connect the unconnected lives in a bid to justify the publication of the title was incoherent and done in poor taste. The book is an eye sore and an abomination...avoid it at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is garbage. Actual rating: No Star","review":"Do not take anything this woman says as accurate on any of the women. If you've done real research on any the ladies in this book as I have, you will know that this book is dreadful fiction. The book seethes with Prose's obvious envy of famous women, it reeks of it. She distorts what few real events she mentioned through that lens. It's the National Enquirer folks.

I found Lee Miller's ability to be both artist and muse especially inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative, provocative vignettes of fascinating women","review":"In \\"The Lives of the Muses,\\" Francine Prose uses 9 brief biographical vignettes to explore what it means to be a great man's muse. She shows how the role of muse has evolved along with women's societal roles, and how intense artist-muse relationships, marked by longing and obsession, take their toll on muse and artist alike. The women, and their relationships with the men they helped make famous, are so diverse that at times the book is a bit disjointed, but overall it succeeds well. Prose is hardly an unbiased observer; it is clear what she thinks of each of her subjects, and her opinionated stance makes an interesting subject that much more lively."},{"rating":"1","title":"A-musing, but alas, not true.","review":"Though Francine Prose's treatments of the nine women she has selected to call 'muses' make great reading, she has, in at least one case, preferenced a 'good story' over truth, scrambled some facts, misstated others, and based much of her information on the biased projections of previous biographers. If this is true for one, it casts doubts over the accuracy of her information for all. Prose is a gifted writer, yet, sadly, she negates the woman each time she choses to use the provocative, juicy, handed-down opinions of those previously determined to 'protect' the artist from the supposed femme fatale. Keeping these women safely tucked away as 'muses,' is a step backwards -- a lost opportunity to truly do justice to the separate lives and achievements of these remarkable women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Me and My Muse","review":"I can only hope my muse arrives sooner than later.

This one comes without performers (in fact, the CD cover is a one-page leaflet, without performers or even composers). The recording quality is unequal, as if they put together a hodge-podge of what they could find. The recording of Albeniz is sufficient, just not good. Besides, what is a crowd-pleaser but completely uninteresting transcription of the Chopin, Moonlight sonata, or Ah! vous dirais-je Maman? (anything but virtuosic) doing in this CD?

I planned to read with this deck at an event a month from the time I acquired it and ordered the workbook to help familiarize myself with the author's intent and interpretation. I like the simplicity of the workbook. It can be used to learn tarot or this particular deck as well as a meditation tool or journal. The thought-provoking questions prompt inner reflection and can help develop intuitive skills. The reader can do the work in order or as cards come up.

I would get the cd \\"Returning\\" and listen to the recordings of the songs because he might've moved the capo down a couple of frets. I think the book is great and william's music is simple to play and really forces you to dig deeper into the emotion of the tune rather than the technical side and be more of a showboat with it. I would say be cautious though because a lot of his tunes...well all of them use alternate tunings. So be ready for strings to break unless you have a guitar geared towards this style. My favorite piece is \\"Impending Death of the Virgin Spirit\\" and \\"The Bricklayers Beautiful Daughter.\\" Like I said simple and yet very challenging to find the emotion in the way that he plays them and forcing to do the same with your interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under no circumstances should anyone buy this","review":"Terrible 'documentary'.

I was right.The Ramones Anthology is a complete discography from beginning to end, beginning from their early days (Ramones, Leave Home, Rocket To Russia) to the last albums (Brain Drain, Mondo Bizarro, Acid Eaters, Adios Amigos). It has most of their hits, and plus some added songs that top off this well rounded collection.I could've lived without R.A.M.O.N.E.S which is my least favorite because, well, it just is.If you like Hey! Ho! Let's Go, you would like (all these bands i like):The Sex PistolsBuzzcocksThe ClashRancidSham 69F*** SparrerX-Ray SpexBottom Line: Read the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"four and 1/2 stars.","review":"i can't be sure about this, but i think that i would probably have turned out to be a much smarter person than i am if i hadn't listened to the ramones soooooo much. i really couldn't help it though; i loved their sound. i know for sure that that \\"gabba gabba hey\\" stuff wasn't good for me, but what was i to do? i really don't have any regrets. so i clean toliets for a living? somebody's got to. intelligence is overrated, i feel. i've had gobs of fun in my life; and the ramones were there all along the way, providing it over and over with those three buzzsaw guitar chords and joey's one-of-a-kind rock and roll voice. no. i have no regrets. i'd better get to bed now, though. got to be up at 6 in the morning. people are gonna be pooping, and i'll be there with my brush to take care of it all. thanks for hearing me out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Awesome CD. First CD is a little less serious then the second one, so the second disk is slower on most songs. Overall a great collection and i would recomend it to anybody. The Ramones are awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Wonderful. . .","review":". . . this collection is! But I can't believe they couldn't find room for \\"I Don't Wanna Go Down to the Basement.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"TWENTY YEARS AND THIS IS ALL THEY GET?","review":"After the Beatles, the Ramones were the most influential rock group of the past 40 years, and they deserve a lot better than this hodgepodge. There's nothing on here that you shouldn't already have, and the hour or so of rarities and B-sides they recorded are nowhere to be found. Why are box sets always so awful? They don't satisfy the true fans and they're too expensive to appeal to anyone else. Start with ALL THAT STUFF VOLUMES 1 and 2, IT'S ALIVE, TOO TOUGH TO DIE and ANIMAL BOY, then get the rest of them in any order you can. Gabba gabba hey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why couldn't they include IT ALL?!","review":"I saw a sign in some record store in San Francisco that this album was the Ramones' ENTIRE CAREER on 2 CDs, which I think is possible, but dumb (of me) to believe--all you have to do is look at the songs listed above. DEFINITELY get their first 5 albums before you do anything (you can find them on auction--or all you kiddies without turntables can buy \\"All The Stuff\\" if you enjoy paying extra-high prices)...I like the book, shows right-wing Johnny with his \\"Kill a Commie for Mommie\\" t-shirt..wasn't it he who was the Reaganite and forced the group to rename \\"Bonzo Goes to Bitburg\\" with the ridiculous and far inferior title \\"My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down?\\" So much for political apathy. Farewell my tarnished idol....Book also spells John Holmstrom's (PUNK Magazine) name wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"You already have a lot of these songs but....","review":"Hey it's The Ramones! You may already have their entire catalog on vinyl, tape, and CD (maybe even 8-track like me!), you may think you have the ultimate compilation with \\"Ramones Mania\\", you may even have downloaded and made your own Ramones CD compilation. But consider this. For the price you can't beat this package. All their most well known, and best songs, a 80+ page booklet with great photos, and a cool little display box that says \\"Hey man! I'm a Ramones fan.\\"However another reviewer hit the nail right on the head. This would make a great gift for someone who is searching for a band with energy, humor, mixed in with rebellion and a little stupidity. Imagine how you can change someone's whole life with this great collection as a gift. I guarantee they'll be out looking for a copy of the movie 'Rock n Roll High School' within a week.Rock on."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is left to say?","review":"Well, I've been a Ramones fan since '77. They did more with three chords than most bands could ever dream.To you newbies, just listen to how tight this band is. The reverb, the harsh guitar chords, the voice, and the drumming are flawless.There's alot to be learned here on how to kick-it with only three chords.The Ramones are in a league of their own. As far as an anthology is concerned...just buy all their albums on cd, 'cause you can never really get enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I needed","review":"As a professional PL/SQL developer, I try to keep abreast of the latest and greatest techniques for accomplishing what my clients need done. This book did not provide me with much I could use. Most of it is the kind of obscure bit-twiddling that Object Oriented gurus seem to revel in. If you are a Java or C fan that wants to beat the procedural/relational PL/SQL language to fit into your OO world, you may like this book better than I did. There was some good info about tuning, but I would not buy the book for that alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! I found a 100% cotton tee","review":"I haven't really had a chance to wear them much, since the weather warmed up just after my purchase, but I'm so pleased to have found some tees that are 100% cotton. They seem to fit nice, but I wish they were a couple of inches shorter. They are too long for me, but I'm 5'2\\" and short waisted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Progressive Works","review":"If you like progressive rock in its prime this is for you.

(I would have bought from Amazon, but we needed one immediately for a presentation.) It is broke. Putting in the batteries occasionally causes the mouse to blink (not every time, just sometimes) but it never actually turns on. I will have to take it apart and see if I can fix it. As of right now, it's a paperweight and we can't return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"poetic, strange, kaballistic & beautiful","review":"This book fascinated me. It takes the reader from a farm in Ontario, Canada to India, Nepal, Singapore and Australia, but the real voyage here is within the world of heart and soul. The writing is distilled and poetic, and the author's voice is strong and original. Wasserman has managed to write about spirits in a way that is believable and not at all hokey -- a major achievement. I believe she is drawing on Kaballah at times, and the story's heart is the love story between Jewish Canadian Rachel Gold and Muslim Malay Kifli Talib. These two are connected by two spirits but also by their physical connection, made at exotic Raffles Hotel in Singapore. The romance of these hotel scenes is perfect -- sensual, passionate, with the edge of fear that is always present when two people lose themselves in one another. And beneath all of that, the menace of the demon who possesses Kifli and threatens Rachel. You won't be able to put down this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xtraordinary Dance Album","review":"I bought this album after falling in love with the track 'Release me' which got a bit of radio play in NYC.

Di CD ini sudah mencakup 95% lagu-lagu hit mereka, sayangnya ada hit Dokken yang terlewat misalnya \\"When Heaven Comes Down\\". Kekurangan di CD ini menurut saya ada sesuatu yang hilang yaitu \\"semangat\\" Dokken yang kurang ter-explorasi.Jika ingin melihat kekuatan musik Dokken sesungguhnya silahkan dengar di CD mereka yang terbaik (menurut saya) adalah \\"Beast from the East [LIVE]\\" is they very best compilation ever !!!."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Very Best Of Dokken","review":"I was 15 when Dokken's Breaking The Chains came out. I have been hooked ever since. I am 33 years old now, and still love Dokken and other 80's hair bands. This cd is a must have. It has every song yoiu would want from the early 80's to the early 90's. Don Dokkens sultry, bluesy, voice and George Lynch's fiery, blistering guitar, made Dokken an 80's icon. Get this cd, you want be dissapointed. Metal Rules...."},{"rating":"2","title":"DON IS MY HERO!!","review":"dokken is by far a top 5 hair band from the 80's. They have it all. The great power ballads to the hard rockin 'breakin the chains'. My all time favorite dokken song is \\"In My Dreams\\" but \\"Dream Warriors\\" is a close second! I wish people from my generation listened to this kind of music. They don't know what they are missing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good collection","review":"A good cross-section from one of the better pop-rock bands of the 80s. Although not really a \\"guitar-god\\" George Lynch was well regarded for his axe-work. Good song-writing and strong vocals rounded out the band. Compared to the other \\"hair-bands\\" of the time, Dokken comes out near the top of the heap. A good collection for anyone nostalgic for 80s rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"This doesn't make sense","review":"Someone wanted to make a couple of bucks and threw some songs onto a cd. Great liner notes and chart peaks for the singles and the albums. But thats not why I gave it a one star. I owe all these songs. Their very best of CD is Beast From The East, when they could still sing, scream and play. I own all the Solo CD's so don't tell me I don't know what I am talking about. The stuff their putting out now, I'd buy used if I could do it all over again. They should stop arguing, just shut up and sit in a room together and listen to these CD's from start to finish Breaking The Chains, Tooth And Nail, Under Lock And Key, Back For The Attack and Beast From The East, then write a new record."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE VERY WORST OF DOKKEN","review":"It's impossible to have an album called \\"The Very Best of Dokken\\" , because they don't have any good song, only some sparks of great guitar playing by George Lynch."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"DOKKEN was a band cretaed since the start with the intentions of copying whateve was in fashion at the moment.

Its got amazing guitaring, vocals, drumming, bass playing...this really is an immortal album from an immortal band. If your unsure about buying this cd then listen to the tantelising guitar playing in MR SCARY! that was enough for me, and if your a freddy fan like myself then you'll love DREAM WARRIORS...i know i do.

Even though I was fan of Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer at that time, Dokken hooked me on. Fabulous guitarist George Lynch was my idol and his guitar style is much similar to my style.I have to say: Dokken is one of the best metal bands ever !!!Even now, I love to hear their songs..., so I find this compilation as success for everyone who love Dokken.

No more worrying. You can be sure that your strap wouldn't come undone with the strap buttons.Some would say that these are of bad quality, well it's just made of plastic, nothing special.The reason for buying this would be if you want a lock strap and you don't want to replace all the strap buttons on your guitar for a set metal strap locks, this would do it.I've used it for more than a month now and have been playing my guitar everyday except for weekends and it doesn't prove to be breaking or cracking.I just think that for a small piece of plastic, they could hopefully sell these for a much lower price.Overall, I'm satisfied with this plastic ergo strap lock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ergo lok strap","review":"these are a joke they don't fit on one of my guitar ends and falls off the other one. forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap. Plastic. Junk.","review":"This is a dangerous piece of junk. The product consists of a small plastic disc that swivels inside a slightly larger plastic disc the shape of a guitar pick. In one orientation, the holes are out of phase and produces an opening through which you can thread the end of your strap button. In the opposite orientation, the hole constricts thereby \\"locking\\" the strap. The design flaws are that 1) the two plastic discs EASILY snap apart and 2) you must have LOTS of clearance between your guitar strap and the tip of the button. This product could only be used with a cheap polyweb guitar strap and a $100 Esteban guitar you wouldn't care about dropping anyway. As it stands, you can forget about using this with a thick, high quality leather strap. All you're doing is lulling yourself into a false sense of security. Pony up and get real Straplocs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work for acoustic electric guitars","review":"I even called Dunlop to see if these lok strap systems would work for an electric acoustic. The guy at Dunlop told me \\"oh yes, they have been specifically designed to work with electric acoustic\\". That is NOT the case. I purchased multiple units, and it will cost me more to return to Amazon than it's worth. But basically I know have hunks of plastic that I could use to make a sculpture!Because of the bottom pin being the plug in for electric pick up, the thickness causes a problem and this plastic do hickey will not fit.If anyone out there has a solution for securing the strap, please reply to this feedback.What really frosts me is that I called Dunlop and apparently their customer service folks don't know their products well enough to be recommending product. It's called, TRAIN your people!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth the cost.","review":"Do they work? Mostly.Are they cheaply made pieces of plastic garbage? Definitely.Perhaps if these were made out of a better material, they would be good. As it stands, this is made out of two cheap pieces of plastic (one of mine cracked). Then there's the cost factor. There is no way this $0.10 worth of plastic should sell for $4. That's an obscene price for such a low quality product. I will never buy this again, and would caution others to steer clear of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work on my Epi EJ200CE endpin/jack","review":"This fit on the button behind the neck of my Epiphone EJ200CE, but the hole wasn't big enough to fit over the other strap button, which is an endpin with jack. If your guitar has two regular strap buttons, I guess it would work okay. When I tried to push it over the endpin/jack, the inner disc came apart form the guitar pick-shaped piece. So, yeah, not so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart!","review":"Hard to believe this was so bad. I have a Planet Waves locking guitar strap, which is a dream, and thought this would allow me to lock a regular strap. However, it is so thick that it can't really fit on a regular guitar strap pin with a strap, and when I tried to lock it, the two pieces came apart. Go with the Planet Waves Lock Straps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't have to screw something in","review":"I bought a rad leather strap with skulls on it, and when I tried to get my Les Paul to hang low, the angle made the strap a little suspect. Using one of these gives it enough security that the guitar isn't gonna fly out. But if you jump around, yes, these will break. However, you do want these guys to break - otherwise, all that tenion's going straight into the screw that's in your guitar.It's good in a pinch. I'd probably get a backup. And make sure you get used to not bouncing around on stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work great!","review":"Bought two sets of these, one for my electric the other for my acoustic.

And also don't consider it if your guitar strap's got thick/extra thick ends.However, for US$3.99, it's still not totally useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promised two....only got one","review":"The product features clearly says that there should be two.....I only got one....and judging by other reviews, I'm not the first this happened too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy.","review":"The product itself is not in question here.

This is only for those who already love and know what jack was capable of- we're better prepared to forgive disappointments like these. If you're new to kerouac do yourself a favor and start with things like the dharma bums, on the road and subterraneans- there's a reason these are as popular as they are.It's nice and short, though.I also want to mention that this is my first review- I'm not in the habit of trashing great writers lesser works.

I think that's what interested me enough to purchase it. I was not disappointed, although I didn't care for a couple of arrangements. This collection represents 4 decades of music, ranging from Ella Fitzgerald to Mel Torme; from Sammy Davis Jr. to the Drifters; and from Judy Collins to Ben E. King. Of course no New York collection would be complete without a couple of Broadway songs. This collection seemed to have something for everyone, including comic relief with Allan Sherman.

I hate losing hair. So I started with a bias. But not to worry. Max is a pretty cool character - moulded as some of the better PIs. Though his martial arts learning is not as well established as Xenon Pearl's (readThe Cutting Season: A Xenon Pearl Martial Arts Thriller), he is well versed in Tai Chi. He never comes across as a bumbling federal agent. And as you read on, you realize that he's pretty resourceful in dangerous situations.The plot is good in the begining but needs some patchwork (some coincidences as suggested by another reviewer) in the end and somehow manages to hang together. Leaving that aside (doesn't get in your way), it was a really entertaining read, never flagging or boring. Highly recommended. Also dont miss the Xenon Pearl books.

Murphy cured me of my ignorance with her compelling descriptions and analyses of the forces -- political, religious, cultural -- that have shaped that land.She does so in part with smart use of colorful characters she got to know during her time covering the region as a Washington Post reporter, and from scads of research... Cleanly organized, thorough, insightful. A very helpful and yet enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Egypt Islamists 1990s","review":"The author presents many very informative insights into the Islamist movement in Egypt during the 1980s-1990s. She hopes that modern Muslim liberals will be able to eventually convince Muslims into rejecting the repressive/regressive beliefs of the conservative Wahhabist Muslim religious leaders. She provides many insights into WHAT is happening in various political matters in Egypt, but failed to really identify WHY the Wahhabist-Muslim theology is so strong. She failed to research the Quran verses (ayats) that promote anti-Jewish and anti-Christian behavior by Muslims that she identifies WHAT is happening so extensively. Due either to her ignorance or her avoidance of this issue, the author fails to explain the WHY of Muslim intolerance of Israel, Christianity, democracy and Westoxification. For this, one needs to read Robert Spencer's THE POLITICALLY INCORRECT GUIDE TO ISLAM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good worship album","review":"We bought this for our Children's Church Program and love it!

The book was about a maiden from a poor family who was really the daughter of the Sea King. But how did she become human? Her purpose was to see what love was like, but don't they know what love is like under the water? One day a man named Lord Holdbrand came to their families pennisula after spending one minute with her, he fell deeply in love with her by some mysterious power. They married and lived happily in their castle, or so they thought. The one point I forgot to tell you is that there was a ghost that haunted the pennisula, and now it followed her to the castle. What is it, why does it want from her? Those are the questions that raced through my mind. This book was good but hard to understand. I encourage you to read this book and maybe you can understand it better then I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spare, Atmospheric Tale of Enchantment","review":"Based upon the novel \\"Undine\\" written in the early 19th century by Friedrich Heinrich Karl, this short novel is spare and seems almost primative. The dialog is simple, the characters not very deep, but it has atmosphere in abundance and romance and obsession. It is the sad tale of a nobleman who is beguiled and ultimately falls in love with a mysterious young woman. It reads almost like a myth or a legend. It draws you into its pages and treats you to emotional ambiance that you won't soon forget. Some elements of the tale are never fully explained, but I did not find that to be a necessity because it is very dream-like or similar to being held under a spell. Anyone who has lived under an enchantment will understand. Read it and see for yourself. It is lovely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmorizing retelling of the Undine story","review":"This book was my first experience with the old fairy tale of Undine, and Mary Pope Osborne manages to capture and retell the story with a mix of spirituality, old paganism, and a dreamy, ethereal magic that is completely addicting in every way. The story is told through the eyes of the prince, the young man lost by the coast to be bewitched by the strange foundling girl. It leads into a passionate, but wonderfully vague, romance that never quite reveals the true mystery of what Undine is and where she comes from. The ending was absolutely marvelous. The writing is spectacular and this is a fine example of a fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"I have used several different printers over the years and this one has to be the worst that I have owned.

It jams the paper almost every time I try to print. The only way to be sure it will print properly is the stand there and feed only one sheet at a time! If I even put so much as 5 sheets of paper in, it pulls the sheets crooked and proceeds to jam. I have looked into the trouble shooting, and all it says is to make sure you are loading paper correctly and that you use ink jet compatible paper, which I do. The only redeeming quality about this printer is that it does print decent quality color pics, once you get it to stop jamming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was left out of 'Forever Amber' ..","review":"This is a hopelessly naive and romantic novel, which nevertheless can engage the reader through the sheer force of its narrative. It is altogether obvious that Winsor would have liked to include scenes of explicit eroticism in her earlier novel, 'Forever Amber' yet was constrained by contemporary morals: it seems that she has made up for her earlier frustration by writing this later book which is virtually one long sex scene. It is a shame that Winsor could not allow Robert to remain a genuine gypsy; a shame also that Arabella takes a consistently subservient role in sexual activities. All the same, there is a bravery and verve about the novel which makes it worth reading, if only as a curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert and Arabella is a bad romance novel...","review":"I loved reading Forever Amber, in fact it is my favorite book. I was so excited to finally find something else she had written, and I started reading \\"Robert and Arabella\\" as soon as it arrived. From the very first page I was dissapointed! The plot was dull and hardly even existed, and Arabella had something \\"moist and furry\\" up her skirts! I found the descriptions totally gaggy, instead of making me hot and bothered. I am not offended by much, but this novel offended me from the first sentance!I wish that this author had more in her, another great epic tale to tell besides Amber, but Robert and Arabella was not it. If you are looking for some laugh out loud historical porno novel, then this is the book for you. If you wanted a nice historical romance without the R rated qualities, then read Gone With the Wind, or Forever Amber, or anything by Phillipa Greggory. Kathleen Winsor missed her mark on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad!!","review":"This book was pretty good, but I don't think it's his best to date.

Just by changing an eyelash yarn to a ribbon, and the wool to a cotton blend, the whole shirt would change. I have enough patterns for knitting shirts (and if I don't, there is the web).This book, though, showed me how changing just a bit here or there can make the pattern my own. I'm not stuck with a railroad yarn or a fluffy wool that would scratch me raw. That is something you rarely see in books these days - how to knit the same pattern with different yarns.Yes, I know that you can change your yarn for any pattern, just gauge it. But this one actually gave examples of what a slight change here or there would actually look like - making this one of my favorite look-for-ideas book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tees are versatile","review":"More than your average tee-shirt.

This is a testament to the concept, as well as the execution of it.

However this CD enhanced those songs, and their styles were change. I think they did a great job doing that, the strings and the background combime perfectly with Laura's voice to give the listener a \\"brand new\\" song. The other songs in this disc showcase Laura's voice and uniqueness. However the only down side to this disc, is Gilberto Gil in \\"En Ausencia De Ti\\" his voice didn't exactly combine with Laura's and at certain times when he had to hold high notes you could hear him going out of tune. Besides this I think this CD has wonderful lyrics, sounds, songs, and is a must have for fans, or ballad lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound of Music","review":"Today you can count with the fingers of one of your hands the amount of valuable voices.

If you have listened to her previous works, you should listen to this. The evolution is unbelievable and more than that, she stands as one of the most promising female voices for the next 20 years or more.The sound of Music is back and Laura Pausini is about to crown her self."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hire a New Composer for This Talented Singer!!!","review":"By the middle of the 5th track, I was ready to swap out the CD!

It layers on color, and when the final come sout people are just amazed.If you need a portable printer, and want the best then get this one.

It's worth ever penny though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dark Pictures","review":"Overall it seems like this printer would be great, however, there is a big big issue here. The pictures that are printed are very dark. This makes people's faces almost impossible to see. I'm using iPhoto to print my pictures instead of printing directly from the camera/memory card itself so mabye that is the issue.I've seen this complaint on numerous message boards (including this one) and I didn't really believe it, but now that I own the printer I can tell you that it is a real problem. There has not been a \\"fix\\" released by Canon for this problem yet and I get the feeling there never will be from what their customer support has been telling me.Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd love it, but.....","review":"I really wanted to give Canon 5 stars on this one. The footprint is small, the idea so superb, but the printer doesn't reproduce the pictures I print faithfully.Canon support has been excellent, but, they replaced my ES1 that was printing dark pictures with an all new one, and the results were the same. So, until I can get a true representation of the pictures that I am trying to print, this printer gets a 3 star.The print quality is amazing, but the darkness of the prints makes the features on a person's face undetectable, ruining all family pics. There is no option to make adjustments on the printer, so unless you want to edit all your pictures (that really don't need editing) you are stuck with darker than real shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photos with some tweaking","review":"We got this about 2 weeks ago; the quality is superior to our last inkjet photo printer, and it's ease of use and small footprint are major pluses.

Give me a break--who thought the Internet was devoid of commercial influences? The book wasn't solely without good points. The amount of information on individual consumers that is freely traded by corporations (especially credit card companies) is indeed troubling.

Mr. Rushkoff is not a conspiracy theorist, he admits that much of the time our coercers are unaware of their own behavior. It is the system itself which is coercive. It is the buisness of the book to tell you how, not that you might join, or donate, or buy from Douglas Rushkov, (get the book at the library if you like.) but so that when you do act you understand first how you have been acted upon. If that is not the most important information any one can give you at the end of the 20th century, I don't know what is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely entertaining, peculiarly pessimistic","review":"Great style, truly captivating.

Much of what Rushkoff reports is accurate, but what he reports isnt the whole story, and it includes his cynical spin.True, manipulation is America's favorite sport and pasttime. But Rushkoff only considers exploitation outcomes. A lot of manipulation isnt evil at all. Bald manipulation is how you motivate many people to do what they fear or believe is impossible. Without manipulation most of us will sit on the curb content to watch the parade pass us by.Good grooming is manipulation. Perfume is manipulation. Good cooking and excellent service is manipulation. Gold stars are manipulation.In fairness, I learned a lot about how unethical people manipulate and exploit others.

Excellent for children who watch television with their parents' guidance. Dodgy humor isn't dodgy when it's explained and understood that it's farcical. Children can learn the difference between fantasy and reality. Honest.2) Victim of horrible timing (Roy's accident).3) This is, at heart, a traditional sitcom. Dad-in-law moves in. Parents find drugs and assume they belong to teenager. PTA episode. Anniversary episode. They got most of the basics done in their first season.4) The animation is astounding and the timing is pretty good. The off-the-wall stuff that wasn't on television before South Park broke ground is pretty damned funny.

Regardless, she had some vinyl and I remember some songs that are missing from the 5 CD set I received.

The Diving Bell in question is an OK design, but curiously is larger on the inside than on the outside! The plot of a lost diving bell and its survivors wandering around in a submarine series of air-pocketed caves could have been a true adventure. Unfortunately, the budget did not allow for any quality special effects or action. The divers exit and enter the bell without an airlock, yet the bell remains water free! Phyliss Coates is the crabbiest female character since Baby Jane Hudson! The male adventurers from the bell have some interesting dialogue, but Carradine has an impotent part and seems to realize it! (He's the designer of the faulty diving bell). There are endless scenes of the lost crew wandering through caverns (filmed in a real cave at least) and the hermit they encounter is one-dimensional. Image quality and sound are poor (the music is out of tune)."},{"rating":"1","title":"fuggitaboutit.","review":"This is a very bad movie. With the exception of a wooden Carradine, the acting is perfectly awful. An explorer inventor creates a diving bell that gets lost. All survive and find an underwater cave, where there is an old man living mysteriously. If that is not preposterous enough, there is a volcano that becomes active, the characters find love and friendship, and then they are rescued.

The book is heavily influenced by the author's Christian beliefs and well sprinkled with scripture quotes, often using quoted scripture as the basis in reason for a certain approach.

Out of the box, the radio wouldn't work unless you pushed the dial in certain direction. But it does work as long as you want to hold the dial. The knob on the charging handle broke off shortly after. When it's dark, more than likely you're going to knock something over eventually. The first time this flashlight fell off a bench, the charging crank broke off completely. I jerry rigged it using an aluminum port cover from the back of an old computer wrapped with duct tape so I could still recharge the flashlight. Last week I pulled it out of a backpack only to find the radio buttons had completely fallen off. The beam is adequate for my purposes, On low - a minute of cranking seems to provide 15 - 25 minutes of light, which I find to be an acceptable ratio. The siren is totally useless. Not loud enough to be taken seriously.

It's not very bright, but it'll keep you from bumping into walls.I wheeled through all of the AM and FM channels and couldn't get any signal, just static.It has a hole with a pin in it that's supposedly you can put a cable in to charge things like cell phones via the dynamo crank. The one square of paper documentation gives no details about what sort of cable you would need.In my opinion, this is the cheap thing you buy before you realize that you really should have just spent a bit more on a better quality item. It'll sit in your kitchen drawer and you'll use it on occasion, mostly for the novelty of cranking your own power, before sticking it back in the drawer for another few years until you rediscover it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool while it worked...for a week","review":"This thing FELT sturdier than a lot of similar items, and the LED was bright.

Most record labels no longer care about it, so why should the fans? The sad fact is that most albums are now being remastered to sound good only on FM radio and ipods. If you dare to listen on headphones (as a previous reviewer discovered) you'll be shocked at how bad it sounds. Even if you ignore the audible crackling, your ears will be so physically fatigued by the looming white noise that you'll struggle to listen through to the beginning of \\"Mondays\\".If you know what I'm talking about, I advise you to return these botched \\"remastered\\" CDs for a refund. If you don't, just Google \\"loudness war\\" and educate yourself to this mess.

In comparing it to a CD copy of my own clean record, the sound of that, digitized though it may be, is much better than this release. Maybe we have become so digital that most of us no longer hear these imperfections, but as an avid present-day record listener, I recommend saving your money and putting it towards a quality turntable.

I question why Sheryl Crow, whom I greatly admire as a pop artist, is included in such a line-up. Jeff Beck is once again the 'stand out' performer along with EC himself, but there are too many other non-legend, lesser knowns to make this a great compilation. We seem to be getting more talk too in place of the music.It's time EC thought of inviting Joe Satriani to 'fire things up' or just get G3 to come and jam - that would really get the place jumping.I hope if EC does this again - he's more selective with artists and the producers of the DVDs are more discerning than the stuff they dished up on these DVDs.What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try to stay awake while watching this","review":"As much as I love Clapton's music I have to say the best Crossroads was the Dallas one.

After the 2007 Festival I would have thought they would have ditched him trying to MC the event, he was so poor. And Cheryl Crow? Gimme a break!

I have pre-ordered the 2010 DVD just to see Jeff Beck again, but I know there will be more jems inside waiting to be enjoyed. The guy who gave it a one star is probably a guitar snob, I've had to deal with them over the years, not everybody who's good gets famous and makes a lot of money, in fact almost nobody gets famous and makes a lot money, especially people who are only trying to do just that.

The kid was excellent, but I could hardly watch him, as he was over-enthusuastic. ZZ-top was fun, Jeff Beck was awesome, and Robert Cray was spectacular. Cray is also very animated and is any wonder he can play so well as he shakes all over the place while he jams. Joe Bonamassa was great, but Derek Trucks and Susan Tdeschi stole the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor editing on this one !!!","review":"Unlike the other \\"Guitar Festival DVD's, this one did not show enough close-ups of the guitar playing.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near the others","review":"As far role-playing concerned, this game is awful.The replay value is nil, because the plot is too centralized to the game, and you can only go to one place at a time. That would be vaguely annoying if not for the forced play: The areas are not an expansive wilderness packed with quests to complete and people to help. The wilderness is packed with monsters, usually exclaiming the same thing every time they die, until you get to the big lead bad guy who just says \\"How did I fail?\\" Then collapses. Then you go back to town and get congratulated for saving everybody once again, or return to fix some problem, and start over, doing the same, monotonous thing over and over again.The dungeon crawls are bearable, but overall, I wouldn't suggest buying this game. It's a better waste of time to just replay Baldur's Gate 2, Torment, or one of those.(Also, I couldn't find a single 2nd level spell scroll for my wizard after playing through the game twice.

Well, the very first time I went to use one, I found that the supplied hex key didn't even fit into the screw in the drill stop. Seriously, if you're going to supply a hex key with the product, make sure it is one that fits. After finding one in my own allen wrench set, I tightened the stop down gently. It loosened and slid up the drill bit during use. Note that I had about 15 repeat-depth holes drilled, all inaccurately by this point. When I went to release the stop and go for a piece of tape on the drill bit instead, the hex screw seemed to strip out. The steel is so soft, that the gentle tighten that didn't even keep the stop from moving up the drill bit was enough to completely strip out the hex insert. what a joke. I just wasted several dollars on junk. I can't find replacement hex set screws that small in a hardware store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drill Stop set","review":"Seems to work ok.

An expedition is dispatched to meet the ship and all goes well...almost too well.The aliens seem to know a lot about humanity. In fact, their knowledge seems uncanny and even frightening at times as they try to mimic their hosts. One person, though, learns the reason for this. They are not a simple group of refugees.

Then, once it's hot, you are to slowly squeeze the insecticide pump trigger once every three or four seconds.The first several bursts of fog work pretty good but after that the fogger starts squirting out steaming liquid insecticide instead of fog. I find that I have to reduce the trigger squeezing rate to one slow squeeze every 15 seconds in order to maintain satisfactory fog quality.The slow rate of fog production is a problem for me as I have a large yard and the rate of fog production, being less than what the manual claims should be happening, is not satisfactory. For a small yard this unit might put out enough fog.I've tried two brand-new propane cylinders and have fiddled with the flame adjustment knob to no avail. I think if the unit had a slightly bigger burner or a larger propane orifice it would work much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One use, igniter failed","review":"With the first use we thought this would be a great solution for our bug issue.

Then the fluid just pours out nozzel. Like most good products, the maker develops a good product, builds a rep for it, then starts to cheap it out riding out the rep until everyone knows it is junk.

You're thinking what are the odds of that happening?? Well it's not astronomical, because guess what, it happened. Although it didn't happened during the preheat, it happened while I was using the unit. So, after putting down and waiting (the book says it will stop when the excess insecticide is burnt out) I started to see black smoke (aka plastic burning) I quickly disengaged the propane tank. I went and got my neighbor (because I didn't have a fire extinguisher or water hose) by then it was engulfed in flames and doused that thing.

I can easily say this is the worst book I've ever read.I'm a freshman in Highschool and this was summer reading...very BAD summer reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting at first, but ultimately boring.","review":"Rober Bloch's \\"Lori\\" begins as a gripping story, but halfway though the book the author begins to draw the plot on too long. One gets the feeling he was stalling the conclusion, and it makes the work seem rather boring towards the end. And considering that there's only one truly frightening scene in this so-called \\"horror\\" fiction, it wasn't very satisfying. I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, disappointing...","review":"Lori Holmes returns from college graduation to a destroyed life: her childhood home engulfed in flames, her parents dead in the blaze, a successful family business abruptly bankrupt. This is the beginning of Lori's nightmare; it will end with a death - but whose? From my point of view, who cares? I think I expected too much, knowing that this was a \\"Robert Bloch\\" novel. My mind wandered throughout, and I never could get into it. I've read many books in the genre that have held me spellbound, notable, in recent years by Mary Higgins Clark. I can't help but wonder what she would have done with this plot. Perhaps I'll read \\"Lori\\" again, in a few years, and see if my perceptions improve any; and perhaps I won't.

It is almost (not really folks) worth watching just for kicks. I can't imagine who this movie is targeted for. No one on Earth, for sure.

We had no idea it was not actually a Christmas movie, but a movie about Alzheimer's and dementia. When I did a search for \\"Christmas movies\\" this one popped up. The title, \\"Lovely, Still\\" and the cover picture make this sound like a \\"lovely\\" film and the title has nothing to do with this film. What is lovely about any of this? We were definitely in the mood for something uplifting and this was not it. We were bummed when it was over. The actors are good, but a lot of the plot was far fetched. Not at all realistic that a man this impaired would be living across the street from his family by HIMSELF and with access to a gun. The plot just did not make any sense! If you want to see a movie about Alzheimer's and a couple's love, watch The Notebook. If you want to see a Christmas movie, don't watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Instant Classic","review":"How does one describe a modern classic?

While this score does have a georgeous main theme, it is not overscored, but instead uses light strings with a heavenly children's choir. the use of synths will either make or break this score for you, with some synths appropriately placed to set the mood for the location, and others just put to provide cheap score, which gets rather annoying at times. but when horner utilizes the use of orchestra along with synths, it sounds surprisingly good, but it is rare. overall this is a horner score not to be missed, because it is a departure from normal Horner style, and horner comes up with some new ideas that sound rather good. I give this album 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful score!","review":"The first track takes my breath away (\\"Ethiopia, 'i'\\" section - opening scene when she (Angelina Jolie's character) first goes to Africa).The CD Booklet - contains black and white images from the film mostly of actors, Jolie and (Clive) Owen, the last page has a full credit list of the Hollywood Studio Symphony. There are no comments or notes from James Horner.The CD is divided into three sections (with 12 tracks) - Ethiopia, Cambodia and Chechnya (4 tracks in each section).Aside from the lovely orchestra sounds there were some very synthesized sounds (which I, personally, did not care too much for).There are two tracks on the CD that are not Horners work - \\"Tirut Tebatin Lig\\" (track 2) and Schuman's \\"Traumerai\\" (track 11), but these tracks fit perfectly with the film score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average score from Horner","review":"This along with the Missing was Horners best from 2003.The synths although dated worked really well in establishing the otherworldly feeling and atmosphere. The film of course while having the best intentions just didn't click for me. I certainly didn't feel that the films foreign footage was exploitative, no it gave us a good look at the suffering of those worldwide from famine and war. The best music that James has written has been for films by Martin Campbell, Edward Zwick, and Ron Howard. These are the type of events we should look more forward to. But alas James won't be scoring Cinderella Man, a Ron Howard film, which composer Thomas Newman is attached to. But that probably won't be a bad thing since Thomas Newman is great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"We've Heard This Before...","review":"What I disapprove most about James Horner is that he borrows from the works of others or reuses his previous scores (Titanic and Deep Impact, anyone?) for inspiration for his newest scores. As for this soundtrack, James Horner completely ripped the title score \\"Ethiopia, Pt.1\\" from The Prayer Cycle's \\"Movement 6: Innocence\\" which featured the vocals of Salif Keita and Alanis Morissette and was showcased during the opening credits of \\"The Affair of the Necklace\\". If you listen to the two, there's almost not a single bit of difference - except that the latter is far better.As for the soundtrack, its good - I just disapprove of the uncanny resemblance of this piece of work with already previously released works from other artist's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of all. just like the movie.

The sizzling R&B; sound cuts right to the roots of rock-n-roll.Maybe it was the close linkage with Bruce Springsteen, the coming of punk rock or FM radio playlists that focused on arena heroes, but Southside Johnny and The Asbury Jukes never broke out from the bars.

Some of the information is redundant, but this communicates his very strong feelings about eating right and exercise.If you are willing to read the book, then you are willing to do something about your health. It is a book for beginners, not for advanced lifters. The diet and exercise recommendations are beginner level, but there is a wealth of information, books and websites in the appendix that is worth the price of the book alone! And you can take the basic information and tailor it to your individual needs. Getting in shape isn't easy, but this book is a good starting point.

The watch is very heavy, but I got used to that. The manual has not one word on how to shorten the clasp wrist band. If you buy one, look for the six band links that have small square holes on both ends. Use something sharp and pointed and push the steel rod out from the smaller square hole side. That link will then be removeable. Once I removed several links, the watch fit just fine. It should keep time just fine; the most expensive quartz movements are under $30 (I had an upscale jeweler tell me that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice but didn't work","review":"The watch arrived with a dead battery.

The sound quality is very poor. Very hard to get any stations come through clear. The CD player is very hard to operate as the CDs very often get stuck inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably won't last long","review":"My daughter received this item as a birthday gift a year ago. She used it very little. She was never happy with it because it's cumbersome and it takes up too much space in her very-limited dorm room. Her dad and I decided to buy it from her. We learned that the CD player has stopped working after only one year. Also, the sound quality is not optimal because the speakers hiss if the volume is not turned up loud. Since the CD player ceased functioning, I have a feeling other features will fail shortly. We are not pleased--and I would not recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Constant static sound reminds me of the 1970's AM radios","review":"The static sound is constant no matter what volume or if you're playing from CD, IPOD or Radio.

The manufacturer must have had to cut some pretty serious corners to foul this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I can't agree more with many of the other reviewers. The hiss on this player is unbelievable. Don't waste your money. We got this for my 8 year old and I thought it was just a flaw in the one we gave for Christmas.

I heard the hissing in the background but blamed it on bad reception in my office building. Today I plugged in my Ipod and can't believe how bad the hissing noise is. I can't turn it up very loud and the noise overwhelms the song. I would like to return it, but alas I didn't keep the box. I would not buy this unit until they fix this issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Wish I had read the other reviews first. I really wanted AM/FM ,ipod and CD on one unit. And this unit includes them all and it really looks good. But it does have the buzz coming from the speakers as others mentioned and it seems that the CD player on mine does not even work. The sound quality from my 10 year old Sony boom-box sounds better (using the \\"Aux\\" input going to the ipod). Too bad. Returning it in the morning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy sound, annoying hiss","review":"It's really too bad that this unit sounded awful. It's got the best bang for the buck for any iPod speaker system, as it offers AM/FM radio, a CD player, and a remote. (Why don't more manufacturers include those features?)But it fails on the most basic test for any boombox -- does it have decent sound quality? It most certainly does not. I don't expect audiophile quality, I just want it to sound reasonably good, and I've heard cheap tabletop CD players that sound better than this product.The hiss that all the other reviewers are talking about is present no matter what sound source you select, and while it's less noticeable when music is playing, it is always there. Music sounds muddy and has no clarity or sparkle whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much amplifier hum (hiss)!","review":"I read the reviews before I bought this. Numerous people complained about a hissing noise that you hear all the time. So why did I go ahead with buying it?Because I am _NOT_ an audiophile! I know people who will only listen to 256 kbps MP3s because they can \\"totally hear the difference between 192 and 256.\\" Well, I can't! So when I read those reviews I thought that maybe the reviewers were just overly picky.Let me tell you-- they are NOT. The humming hissing noise is really loud. It sounds like those old clock radios \\"wake to buzz\\"-- if those alarm clocks have a volume of 10, this is certainly a 1.I really really thought that I could deal with it. I said, \\"Well, most of the time I will listen to it fairly loud.\\" But then a song came on that had a lot of quiet parts, and you could hear that horrible hiss!I'm going to have to send it back-- it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a reptile in the room","review":"iLive?

It only goes away when the volume is all the way off. It doesn't matter what mode you are in (iPod/CD/Tuner modes), it's always there. I planned on using it mainly in my bedroom while falling asleep but at a songs low sleeping volume, the hiss and song levels are about equal! If you push the volume higher the hiss isn't that noticeable but, in general, the sound quality isn't great. I may have lived with the sound quality at this price point but I just can't deal with this much hiss.I really wanted this to work as I liked all the features but with the hiss and lacking sound quality it's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe how awful this is . . .","review":"I read the other reviews and thought that the music-lovers were being overly picky when they complained about the hiss, so I went ahead and ordered this anyway. I cannot believe how loud and awful the hiss is . . . incredibly distracting. I thought I could deal with it, because I only intended to use the unit in my office, but it also turns out that every time you turn the darned thing off, it resets to an insanely loud volume when you turn it back on. I am now hiding in my office completely mortified. I'm going to have to return this item, which is a shame, since I was really excited about a unit that allowed ipod docking and also plays my CDs.

I don't buy the \\"it's great for the cost\\" argument. It costs too much for what it delivers, and the remote is junk--you have to stand over the unit and point from three inches away--so why bother with a remote? (Answer: because you have to use a remote to play the unit.) Also, I find this player gives me very little control. The bottom line is: if you want something good, get something else.

Yes you do hear a little static on the unit when it is on but when a song is playing at a low volume you can not hear the static unless your ear is right in front of the speaker. It picks up radio stations well when outside but has some difficulties when indoors. Having a USB input for other devices and video out for iPod video just add to the functionality of this unit. For the price and the features it has I would say this was a great buy and would buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, save your $$","review":"This product is not even worth buying. It works *sometimes*, I'd say the iPOD player works about 75% of the time, and the CD player works about 25% of the time.

The cost wasn't worth it.On February 1, I went into a local department store to purchase some clothes.

I was wrong....At low volume there's a constant annoying hiss, and any volume above the hiss range the bass disorts so badly it's almost unlistenable....even with bass set at lowest level. I wasn't expecting Bose quality at this price, but this is the worst sound quality I've ever heard in a boombox. My cell phone mp3 has more punch.

It's even worse than 'Tom Cat'. But I guess that's what you might expect from a 'best of' rendition. You usually get what you pay for.

The book is mainly annoying in its constant efforts to pass some simple occult and magical ideas off as 'not spells' or 'not sorcery'. The core ideas for using a wand for specific spell-casting aren't bad, but the fakey window dressing is just silly.Don't pay more than $3 would be my advice ;)Ian"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocritical Nonsense","review":"As far as basic wanding skills and so forth, that's ok, but the authors views of other religons in th is book is ill researched.

I suggest getting a different book that is not conflicting with itself that doesn't put everyone that is not a Christian a devil and can't wand as well. lol Don't waste your money.

Finally, toss in a few floppy, rubber \\"monsters\\", hand-made by four year olds, and you've got THE LOST CONTINENT. The title is interesting, considering the fact that NO continent, lost or otherwise, ever appears in this film! Just lots of seaweed, boredom, and plot threads that add up to nothing in particular.

We were give free passes to see the movie the next day and I could certainly see why this was a box office BOMB. I have read after all these years Minelli, Judy's husband at the time had the hots for Gene and was giving all his attention to Gene numbers.

In addition, it had little if any success in its time. However, I find qualities in it which have only become more enjoyable each time I see Gene and Judy oh-so-delicately camping the pirate adventure movies of the time. Gene's rooftop trek is a gem--do you applaud or laugh? And Judy could do anything, but one of her best things was being a clown--what a great ending and what fun the whole thing is!By the way, I first saw it over sixty years ago, so I feel entitled to comment on the fine aging of \\"The Pirate\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirate(ed)","review":"Have been a keen purchaser of all remastered MGM releases, I was eager to obtain a copy of this film. Alas I should have saved my money. The picture quality is poorer than my 20 year old video verson (it looks even more dreadful when screened through a home projector), sound quality is not much better. Unfortunatly no effort has been made to clean this classic up. There are no menus, and about 5 or so chapters inserted without any prior thought.

Even worse, they've become discolored in areas of wear (i.e. where person's back and feet are in contact most) and appear dirty even when freshly washed.

I asked for my shipping charges to be refunded since they totally screwed up. They never replied and I've received no refund. I assume they're just ignoring me.The sheets arrived today and the color is MUCH darker than what is represented on this website. We'll see how they hold up.

Then, we get the sheets and try them on the bed to make sure they fit (we have a deep pocket) and we don't even get the fitted sheet half way over the bed before it snaps. We contact the company who says, \\"this never happens\\" and then requires we send PHOTOGRAPHS to prove that it is broken. After we send them shots, they don't even ask if we want a refund they just send an email stating they are sending a second sheet.

Frankly I couldn't disagree more. Ok, so Mirrors is hardly \\"classic\\" BOC, but then take a listen to their early stuff - there is no such thing as typical BOC. Mirrors is not their best, but it has some brilliant tracks. \\"In Thee\\" shows a side of the band that few heavy bands dare try, yet the BOC pull it off in superb style. \\"The Vigil\\" has one of the best instrumental breaks ever. It's lighter and less metallic than some people would like, but let's face it, the heaviest metallest BOC album of all is that total pile of crap \\"Imaginos\\".

Musically, it represents a misguided attempt to repackage BOC as a guitar-pop group along the lines of Cheap Trick (whose producer at the time, Tom Werman, was borrowed for this album -- his only work with BOC). Many BOC fans dislike this album so intensely that they prefer to call it \\"Errors\\". I wouldn't go quite that far, but I do think that of BOC's studio albums, only \\"The Revolution By Night\\" is worse than this one. Some of the songs are quite weak, particularly \\"You're Not the One (I Was Looking For)\\" -- an obvious ripoff of The Cars' \\"Just What I Needed\\" -- and the title track.On the plus side, \\"In Thee\\" is probably the prettiest ballad BOC has yet recorded, and \\"Dr. Music\\" is energetic and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back to psychedelia but where is heaviness?","review":"Where is hard rock? They most likely decided that people were tired of classic hard rock and they were right. By that time NWOBHM was beginning to kill off the old-timers, Deep Purple was disbanded and gone, Black Sabbath was producing same-sounding records every year, Led Zeppelin was done... so BOC probably decided what the heck, let's do pure pop with some psychedelic overtones. And they did! I give them credit for consistency here - there is not one real heavy metal song here at all! \\"In Thee\\" is more or less decent, \\"Dr.Music\\" and \\"The Great Sun Jester\\" are interesting for psychedelic fans, and what's in it for me? The answer is \\"Lonely Teardrops\\". That's the only track that somewhat saves this failure... then again I might be wrong. The song is pure pop and is just a unashamedly simple ballad but it is at least a very enjoyable and simple pop tune. Try it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOC's weakest effort","review":"I hate to say anything bad about Blue Oyster Cult, but they've turned out a lot of recordings over the years, and some are bound to be better or worse than others. This one seems to have no purpose in life. BOC has always had two sides: the headbanging biker band on one side, and rock's answer to Edgar Allen Poe on the other. Mirrors fails to bring out either aspect of the band, so all that remains is a collection of forgettable tracks that could have been done by anybody. Devoted BOC collectors may want to buy this CD for the sake of completeness, but it's hard to recommend for any other reason. There are better BOC discs you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadly overlooked","review":"Mirrors is all-too-often characterized as a disappointing diversion from BOC's heavy late 70's uprising. However, BOC always mixed catchy hooks with the crunchy stuff, and Mirrors was no exception. In addition to the concert rave-ups like Dr. Music, Great Sun Jester and The Vigil by the typically consistent Buck, Bloom and the Bouchard Brothers, there is the surprisingly exceptional songwriting of Allen Lanier's In Thee (which has enjoyed a renaissance these last few years)and Lonely Teardrops (truly lonely indeed). Mirrors holds up as well as any other arena rock album of the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sun Jester Supreme!!","review":"The best song here by far is \\"The Great Sun Jester\\"!! Its incredible musically, as good as anything by Pink Floyd, and since I'm Fire Godd, I like to think of myself as a sun jester too, being able to strike anyone down with a hot firey molten beam of light!! Another good fire classic here is \\"Moon Crazy\\" since the light of the moon is merly a reflection of the sun's light, so even at night we have the sun's fire with us!! This is another great BOC album, they truly dance around the flames well. FIRE!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect fingerings","review":"I have never reviewed a product before but felt the need to speak up. The fingerings on this chart are incorrect.

We passed it over the weeds slowly as the directions indicate and nothing happened. Holding the fire on the weed until it singed and almost burned or did burn seemed to work better. Also, you can only use this in a very pristine area. No pineneedles, small leaves or mulch. The instructions say to carry a fire extinguisher with you as you work. We were working in an area that had small pieces of old leaves around rocks,etc that we could not rake all away. We kept starting fires in that area and having to put them out with water.

Spraying will kill 'em, but then your left with a wasteland of dry weed stalks all over the gravel. Well, no more breaking my back bending over and pulling them up one-by-one. This thing is AWESOME.

The flame seems not really hot enough to actually kill many of the local weeds and grasses, though it looks scary to the neighbors, who think we're about to start a brush fire. (This is Southern Arizona.) The device is also awkward to use without getting a proper propane tank dolly. I tried to gerry-rig a tank tied to a hand-truck. Didn't really work, though it might with a hand-truck of a different design. The one Red Dragon offers costs more than the Weed Dragon itself.

It can ignite dried grasses or material easily while trying to burn weeds so keep water or hose near by. With the drought last summer weeds tend to survive and the grasses dry out making it difficult to target them in some areas. Still it is a good product to use instead of chemicals. I have tried other weed killer methods including vinegar and non toxic weed killer (expensive) and this kills the weeds right away but they do come back most of the time, so it is on going work as most other methods are.

In my case, in the woods with dry leaves on a gravel driveway and wind all the time it is a recipe for disaster. The flame is not very focused and unless you absolutely fry the weeds, they don't die. Even the young ones.

The first section, or book, is by the editor/author, and provides an introduction to some basic ideas of the language. It usually surprises students how quickly they begin picking up the meaning. The material is subtly graded, so the reader does not struggle with the addition of new words (the translations listed unobtrusively at the bottom of the page are helpful when newly-introduced words are not recognized). The adapted selections used in the rest of the book give students a feel for works by Italian authors, while at the same time making them accessible. Again, there are footnotes for new terms.

This is not the way to handle products for a mattress. Who knows where this foam has been? I need to know my foam is clean if I am going to put it on my bed. I am discouraged.

This book is less of an objective review of Rommel's campaigns, but rather a poorly masked attempt to completly discredit any and all actions taken by Rommel in WWII. The strong bias in this account is evident within the books first few pages and continues throughout the volume. I have tried to read this book twice without success. The unbalanced nature of the account is so annoying that after my second attempt the book found it's rightful place in my circular file. Hence this review.Avoid this one like the plague! There are too many numerous and well written accounts of Rommel's war record to waste time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever written about Rommel","review":"The reader should don a pair of waders before opening this book because of the amount of mud that it slings.

Reality? Rommel was second rate for the Germans, and got his job, and promotions largely due to propaganda reasons and friendship with Hitler.While a tactical genius, and excellent at operations, his stratgic level decision making was poor at best... ignoring logistical realities and the larger strategic picture.Rommel's job in the sand was to hold off the British- not conquor the Middle East. He failed, largely due to ignore logistics.Macksey does an excellent job reviewing Rommel's life and accurately pointing out his strenghs and weaknesses.If you are looking for a honest appraisal of Rommel, buy this book.

I am so glad that I purchased it because I read it in less than 24 hours. It is obvious from the very first page that the author is creative and intelligent. It shows throughout the novel in his descriptive dialogue and ability to craft a story. The novel shows what can happen when someone has inspirations that do not coincide with those who claim to love him. Thad wanted to live his life his own way and not the way that his father or girlfriend had envisioned it. That is something that so many of us have to go through, including myself, when we decide to make our own decisions in life. I can really appreciate in intricate message behind his words and I look forward to his next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kitchen Full of Sin!","review":"Sin was an interesting story of individualism and rising above the status quo. While an obsessive tug of love was the underlying theme, the struggle Thad encounters trying to spread his wings and make his dreams manifest was inspirational. Through his whole eye-opening journey and labor to please his woman, father, mother and the memory of his brother, I enjoyed this novel mainly because it shows the downside of bringing others into your dream and how friendships can be as phony as a three dollar bill. From a relationship aspect, this novel is a psychotic terror filled ride as Thad is strapped on to a woman who makes Glen Close in Fatal Attraction look like Martha Stewart meets Mr. Rogers....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This book was not worth the time spent reading though it.

She may have been a Goody-Two-Shoes, but she was so controlling and unlikable. Lucien was a wonderful hero but she wanted to call the sheriff when he killed a guy in self-defense. And if that wasn't prim enough, she was flipping out because she went riding with him without a chaperone. And some of the dialogue was so dramatic it was hard to believe.Give this one a miss. Damien's story is more realistic and gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!!","review":"This was an excellent follow-up to The Duke. I loved the complexities of Lucien, the fallen angel. I also loved how Alice balanced him out so well. Unlike some reviewers, I thought the spy subplot worked well and made the book much more interesting than Lord of Ice. My only criticism of Foley's Knight novels is that I wish there were just a few more love scenes. Otherwise, definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girls...Gaelen Foley does it yet again!!!","review":"Brilliant!!!! I absolutey love Ms. Foley's work!!!

It is full of all of the rich emotion and complex characters that I have come to expect when purchasing a book by this outstanding author!!! Lucien was sooo tortured and beautiful...and Alice was his perfect match...This story was divine!!! Girls...buy this book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"I absolutely could not put this book down. Lucien captured me from the very beginning. I love how the author went straight to the point -- Lucien realizing he needs Alice in his life and it was so difficult for him to let go of the walls he put around himself and trust this goddess that would indeed save Lucien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaelen Foley at her best","review":"I just read some of the negative and so-so reviews of this book and I have to say, I am apalled! This and Lord of Ice are two of my favorite books of all time. I'm a long time historical romance reader and the Knight twins' books are some of my only \\"keepers.\\" I have also read the Ascension series and The Duke, and although I liked them, they pale in comparison to Lord of Fire/Ice.Lucien and Alice were obviously meant for eachother. Alice was the pure, sweet water that assuaged Lucien's thirst (you'll understand when you read the book). They were so great together, and when Lucien made his confession about Bardou at the end of the book (I'm not really giving anything away by saying this) I found myself crying right along with them. These characters were far from flat and one-dimensional (sp?); I really felt like I knew them from reading the book.I can't give enough praise for Lord of Fire (and Lord of Ice). I hope you enjoy Foley's work as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"It's not that I fault the writing of this book. It just wasn't for me. The plot was very contrived and compared to Lord of Ice, it was a sad example of what this author is capable of.I don't like the type of storyline where someone who is actually a nice and virtuous person is forced into a situation they don't want to be in. I also don't like when the heroine is so spineless and innocent she can't hold her own against smoldering eyes or lusty kisses. I don't like when the heroine is unerringly drawn to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. And I don't like when the hero sees an innocent woman and just must have her, no matter the consequences. All of these things happen in this book. I was cringing through the first 1/3 of the book because I knew the heroine's obnoxious innocence was going to get her into trouble. Just not something I could recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I bought this because of all the great reviews and because the author came so highly recommended; I couldn't have been more disappointed. The characters lack depth and are emotionally immature. The entire story line jumps from one implausible event to the next. The rules and world of Regency England are ignored altogether.All in all, this book is a waste of time and money. Don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but I expected better","review":"After reading \\"The Duke\\" I was simply blown away...that has got to be one of my favorite romance books, after Whitney my Love. I was looking foward to reading more about the Knight brothers, but this book wasn't as good as it's predecessor. Too bad, because I think Gaelen Foley has a really great writing style. The heroine didn't seem very charismatic, and at times was rather boring. Lucien is more intriguing though. Overall it wasn't a bad book, it had an semi-interesting plot, and kept me reading, but it wasn't memorable. I hope Lord of Ice is better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what romance is all about!","review":"As a rule, I don't write reviews but I was so utterly moved by this novel that I felt compelled to. This is truly one of the finest novels I've ever read and it's headed straight for my keeper shelf. Lord of Fire is intricately plotted with lush writing which spirals toward a spiritual level that I find very rare in today's romance reads. It is an utterly awesome tribute to the healing power of love...entirely amazing! In Foley's highly capable hands the love between these two becomes transcendent. Shine on, Gaelen...shine on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the Hero....","review":"\\"Lord of Fire\\" had so much potential, but it never really did it for me. The only reason I gave this book 2 Stars is because I LOVED Lucien, but I just couldn't get past the way this book was written and how unbelievable it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"After reading (and re-reading) the Duke I anxiously looked forward to this novel and the companion \\"Lord of Ice\\". I was very disappointed. The characters had no depth and the story never caught my attention. Not a keeper-sold this one to Half Price Books."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars just for Lucien","review":"I LOVED Lucien Knight in this book. He embodies what a romantic hero is to me: gorgeous, mysterious, tortured, strong, courageous, considerate, has depth, etc. I really could go on. He is intense and he makes his twin and Robert from The Duke seem boring in comparison. Alice is lovely and what she brings out in Lucien is really the beauty of the book. He has lived on the dark side for so long and meeting pure, angelic Alice forever changes him. What I liked about her is that she wasn't so \\"goody-goody\\" in the sense that she appreciates him for all that he is, even when he's obviously seducing her, she isn't prudish in any way. She is intrigued by him and instantly attracted even though she knows how \\"evil\\" he is. Read this book if for no other reason than the scene of their first meeting and interrogation. I've read many a romance novel and this scene is in my top 10 favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaelen Foley knows her romance!","review":"An excellent romance! This is my first Gaelen Foley book and I am throughly HOOKED. Absoluetly cannot wait to read The Dule, Lady of Desire and most of all, Lord of Ice.

Loved it, absolutely loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT READ","review":"this is the first book of Gaelen Foley's I've read, and it was great. I'm an avid reader and some of my favorite authors are Mary Jo Putney and Johanna Lindsey. Now I can add Gaelen Foley.

The short but explosive title track kicks things off, followed by the uptempo starts and stops of \\"Lightning in the Sky.\\" Next is the gorgeous, gentle \\"Aqua Marine,\\" a good song to chill to. Next are the two \\"hits\\" from the album, the poppish \\"You Know That I Love You\\" (which has an excellent closing section) and the spirited \\"All I Ever Wanted.\\" The remaining tracks are highlighted by the pumped \\"Stand Up\\" and the smooth \\"Summer Lady.\\" I disagree with other reviewer's opinions about Alex Ligertwood's vocals - he was one of Santana' better singers, along with Rolie and Walker.Marathon is a well-played, excellently recorded gem from Santana's late 70s/early 80s era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Heavy!","review":"This album is pretty hard rocking by Santana standards andwhat isn't it produced in an equally dence,weighty manner.Mostla showcase for Carlos's patented riff-o-rama's the pleasant R&Bof \\"Stay Beside Me\\" is the closest thing the album has to pop,even though it's equally as likely to punch you out as the rest is.An aquired but rewarding taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Album By A Truly Righteous Rocker","review":"MARATHON is a wonderful album by Santana, who is not only a soulful, masterful guitarist, but a wonderful human being who supports sanctions against Indonesia for their trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a foreign tourist. That said, all of the songs here are wonderful, contrary to what virtually all critics have said. These reviewers are missing out on some great vocals from Alex Ligertwood and Greg Walker, as well as hot, fluid guitar work from the man himself. MARATHON is an album that anyone who loves rock & roll AND cares about others should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Santana Album Ever","review":"This my favorite Santana album. It is much more standard rock without as much percussion as some of the others. Every song is excellent and Carlos really plays a smoking guitar on this one. Aqua Marine is really a masterpiece. Summer Lady and Stay are beautiful lite rock tunes. All I Ever Wanted really kicks. Alan Pasqua plays excellent keyboards throughout the album. Alex Litgerwood's vocals are tremendous."},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL ROCKS","review":"I purchased this on vinyl when it came out and I still like this album. Carlos still had the fire in his belly. What he's doing nowadays is OK but I can't get too worked up about it. He has softened up his sound and records sales go up, wow, not THERE'S A shocker!!Even though I am not too excited by what he's doing these days Carlos will always have a place in my heart. Although he's got some good stuff out there his first 3 CDs are still classics to me. Listen to the track TOUSSAINT L'OVERTURE from his 3rd album, for me THAT was the classic Santana sound and nobody did THAT better!! Nobody!![..]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost of energy and wonderful solos","review":"I remember when \\"Marathon\\" came out and the local radio staion started playing \\"Hard Times\\".

I don't agree with all of Breger's conclusions and analysis of Freud's motives; but that doesn't detract from my liking of the work. It is an authoritative and informative reconning.My biggest complaint is Bregen's failure to diagnose. (Bregen is a prominent Professor and Psychoanalysist.) Freud, it appears to me, had a classic Narcissitic Personality Disorder. To not engage in the discussion of this does the world and humanity a disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get to know the man behind the theory!","review":"Despite all the biographies of Freud out there, none have been written by actual psychoanalysts which means no one has really looked at Freud's life, especially his early family life, from a psychoanalytic perspective. Breger's portrait is endearing and a little tragic - it shows us how many of Freud's ideas emerged from his own struggles with the loss and pain of his early experience. Breger's story is as much a biography of early psychoanalysis as it is of Freud's life, and not the mythical, heroic version of Freud's life that he wrote for himself and his biographers have clung too. This is Freud uncensored!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great looking helmet (for a lady).

The basics of Chinese sentence structure and grammar are explained very clearly and in a very illustrative way. In many places the author comments and explains about the \\"balance\\" of the sentence - which is very important in speaking fluent Chinese. In fact, I owe much of my understanding and quicker learning of the language to this book. The vocabulary is very useful, although in some chapters the number of new words is a little big. The tapes are OK but nothing beats a native speaker to practice on. One major fault in my opinion is the use of simplified characters. It's true that they are the ones that are used in China today, but not in Taiwan and not in Hong Kong.

I finally put it in my steel desk vice, got channelock pliers and stuck an old screwdriver in the collar hole (looks like where a chuck key should go, but the handle on my chuck key wouldn't fit). I tightened it alright, it worked great until I wanted to change bits and it took me 10 minutes to reverse my tightening using the same vice and pliers. Afterword, same story, it would not tighten just would slip constantly. Am sending it back and trying the Makita chuck.P.S.

He COULD have made reading this play an enriching experience for you by telling you what on earth it is about, but unfortunately for you, he takes great pleasure in watching us all crumble to the ground in failure.Just remember: the Half-Child is EVERYONE.

I just wish there was more material on this wonderful comedian who left us all too soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit advanced for a 2yr old","review":"My 2.5yr old son owns almost all of the Brainy Baby DVDs (he's got 10 of them) so when I saw this DVD and read the positive reviews I bought it and Brainy Baby Art. When we received it I sat my son down and watched it with him. He just was NOT interested in this video. After a few minutes he went off and started playing with his toys. At 2 he's not interested in knowing wind instruments, string instruments, quartets, harmony, etc. My son loves music and he loves making music on his keyboard and he owns alot of musical instruments he loves playing. This video seemed a bit to advanced to be understood by a 2 or 3yr old unless they're gifted. I'm going to put this video up and try it when my son's 3.5 or 4yrs old. If you've got a 2yr old who's interested in music I'd suggest \\"Blue's Big Musical\\" wich is more toddler friendly. He LOVES that DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen better!","review":"Although this DVD is very educational, much of it is not interesting to a one, two or even three year old. An older child may thoroughly enjoy it however. The lessons are presented in short increments but not the most exciting manner. If you have a little one, check out the \\"Trebellina\\" DVD instead. Not only are little kids riveted, but they actually learn more advanced material (like how to read written note music -- yes, really -- and pitch training) than on this DVD. It is all in the way it is presented. From a parents' perspective, the music on Trebellina is really fun as well. My toddler liked Brainy Baby but LOVED Trebellina and learned much more from it. She was reading music at 3 yo and started taking piano lessons. Her teachers were amazed at what she already knew, how good her ear was, and how quickly she picked up concepts. If you want your little one to learn music, look at another product but keep this in mind for an older child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD for a budding music enthusiast ....","review":"My son LOVES this DVD, and has liked it since he started seeing short segments of it from our cable company's On Demand feature. He probably started watching the pieces around age 2 and he just turned 4. He's always been interested in music so this is right up his alley. My daughter is 20 months and also enjoys it but definitely does not understand the content -- she just likes watching the kids play music and dancing to it. Would recommend if your child has any interest in real music (instruments, types of music, playing music) and is old enough to pay attention, otherwise it would be wasted on them. The music is upbeat and fun, the videography is good (except the rock & roll segment makes me dizzy -- at least it's short), and the concepts are presented very simply for kids in the 2-5 age group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Very disappointed - the plug doesnt stay in the only way to use it is to hold the plug into yoru phone.

I'm a medieval hobbyist & craftsman who is always looking for design ideas. Typically I avoid the medieval \\"overview\\" books, but this book is a mother lode of illustrations, many of which I have not seen before. I brought it to a history club meeting and hardly a person saw it who didn't ask about getting a copy. I do recommend Medieval Panorama wholeheartedly for the person who is looking for pictures of medieval objects, buildings and art across a broad range of medieval topics and areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I cannot recommend this DVD highly enough.

At first I thought my daughter wouldn't like it because some of the songs weren't exactly like the Noggin videos or her CDs. She didn't mind at all. We watch this at least once a day and it always gets her up and dancing. You can tell Laurie genuinely enjoys children and they genuinely enjoy her. She, and her band, are a delight to watch again and again and again and again....."},{"rating":"2","title":"great DVD!!!","review":"My 2 year old daughter has loved the Laurie Berekner Band since she saw them on noggin, and she LOVES this DVD!

But what's the deal with the hideous audio recording? She sounds like she's singing in a tunnel 5 miles away! Tell me I just got a bad disc or something!!

He runs around singing the songs and does the movements, too. Surprisingly, my seven year old also likes it. Neither complain about it being played too long. They watch it in the car, which is better than the movies they watch. At least they are interacting. The only loser on the DVD is the guy who sings poorly. He did a remake of an old song that isn't very catchy. He could have picked a different one for the kids. Laurie's voice is crystal clear so there is no guessing what she is singing. Makes it easy for the kids to learn her songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"We are............Laurie Berkner fans!!","review":"My husband, our two-year-old grandson, and I watch this dvd almost every night.

I have not seen a toddler yet who does not dance to their music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurie Berkner Band","review":"This is an excellent video for toddlers. My son learned so many words by watching this video. Before I knew it, he was singing and dancing along with Laurie. The songs are really toddler-friendly. I even found myself singing and dancing to the songs. This is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!!!!!","review":"Our daughter got hooked on Laurie when she was about 6 mos old watching her videos on Noggin. The music and videos have always riveted her and she would bop along. Now at 22 mos she likes to sing, clap and dance along and will even specifically ask for Laurie and has some of her favorite songs the she will ask for, like Shady Tree (Under a Shady Tree) and Chicken Egg (I Know a Chicken).These videos are terrific -- done in a similar style to those featured on Noggin, only I think these are better. Laurie is a terrific talent who's music is comtemporary and relevant for kids. The tunes are high energy and catchy and won't drive parents crazy! Heck, I'll admit it, we find ourselves singin along!We just have one request -- Laurie has so many songs we love, we need another collection of videos on DVD!The Greathouses"},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful - 5++++++++stars!","review":"My 3 year old daughter LOVES this DVD! She knows all the songs and even plays instruments to them while it's playing. It's very, very cute and entertaining. The songs are great and very fun to watch. I love the fact that my daughter sings and plays (instruments) along. I even join in sometimes! I highly recommend. It's a DVD we all watch over and over together. I would give this even more stars if I could. Lots of fun and worth every penny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of our favorites","review":"This was a replacement purchase. Our first one cracked due to constant playing and a 22 month old taking it out of the case. Both my boys loved/love this DVD. My older one is now 5 1/2 and still sings along when his brother watches. The music is lively and quite clever. The outfits are just as colorful. There is NOTHING boring or bland about this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE LAURIE BERKNER BAND","review":"MY GRANDCHILDREN, AGES 6 AND TWINS 2 1/2 ALL LOVE TO DANCE TO AND WATCH THIS DVD!

I would HIGHLY recommend it for anyone with kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video to get the kids moving","review":"I recently purchased this video for my 4-year-old daughter. She loves being able to dance to all the songs. I dance with her too! It's a good way to spend time with her and get some exercise too. The songs are silly, creative, and not annoying at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE it!","review":"Our children and their friends just LOVE this DVD and audio CD! It is entertaining and educational and keeps the kids moving. This is not a DVD/CD that you sit on the couch and listen to . . . you get up and dance, sing, play and have lots of fun! I like that the music is appealing to parents as opposed to some other children's music on the market today. Our children love that there are kids in the videos too and that the songs are easy to memorize - they know all the words. Highly recommend to any parent/family for hours of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low budget, but still great for kids!","review":"If you are used to slick Nickelodeon videos then yes, this does seem pretty low budget and maybe even a bit hokey at times. But my 2 year old LOVES it (she spends all day marching singing 'we are the dinosaurs, marching, marching') and the music can't be beat. We love the Laurie Berkner Band! If you haven't been introduced to their music yet, your money might be better spent on a couple of the albums such as Rocketship Run or Under a Shady Tree, those are our favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play that guitar!","review":"My two year old loves to play the guitar and he absolutely LOVES this DVD!

My kids love Laurie Berkner on Noggin and it is great that we now can watch more than one video at a time. I only wish it were longer because my kids love it so much. I hope they put another DVD soon. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great musical entertainment for all ages!","review":"I have two kids, ages 5 and nearly 2. They both love this dvd. I have many kids who come to my house for playdates and Laurie Berkner enchants all of them.

She loves Jack's Music Show, but loves Laurie more. She now asks for it over other things to watch like Sesame and Blue's Clues. She even runs around the house singing 'Pig On Her Head' and 'I am a fish\\"- laughing and dancing around. It is very cute. She follows all the moves the kids do.The DVD is not that professionally done, but for a kid it is perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kids dance and sing DVD","review":"My kids and another that I watch after school want to watch the DVD every day of the week after they homework.

I have a 4 yr old, 2 1/2 yr old and 14 month. My husband bought this dvd and it is wonderful and it doesnt get annoying. My family just came back from a long 12 hour car ride this was the only dvd that kept their attention and no crying. It is very catchy I even heard my husband singing the songs along the way.

I heard this reviewed on NPR and they were right! Sent it to my grandchildren. My daughter-in-law had been looking for it locally and the 2 & 2 year olds had heard of Berkner. They were estatic to receive it. At Thanksgiving they were constantly asking to play it and love to dance to this wonderful music. If you are looking for something for preschool or even early elementary children, you can't go wrong with this. If I had it at home, I'd play it once in awhile!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"10 Star\\" Rating","review":"Every family should own this DVD. F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S!!

The Laurie Berkner Band","review":"Absolutely FANTASTIC! My 18 month old is a music nut! She absolutely loves music and loves watching the Jack's Big Music Show videos on Noggin. For any kid who loves music this is the perfect gift because it has been the only thing that keeps my daughter attention span! I HIGHLY recommend the DVD, because it is upbeat and the music is catchy. There isn't a day that does go by where my daughter is running up to the DVD player and pressing buttons wanting to turn on the video. I have finally had a chance to catch up on the laundry since finding this DVD! PERFECT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurie Berkner dosen't disappoint!","review":"Laurie Berkner did it again! My 20 month old son would stand & watch Laurie and the band all day long if I'd let him! He jumps up & down and sings & dances to this amazing video. The songs are catchy and the bright colors of clothing and props keep the attention of my 20 month and 4 year old boys! If your children like Laurie Berkner, this is a must have video!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurie Berkner DVD","review":"I got this DVD for my son who is turning 1. He loves it! There is something about Laurie that he loves.The videos are simple which is great for little ones and he enjoys watching the kids dance around. This was a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Gonna Get You!","review":"We love this video. Yes, it's a little kitschy but who really cares. The music is good, the performances are good, the entertainment value is good. It's just plain good.I can watch this again and again and not want to poke my eyes out. Those of you with toddlers know exactly what I'm talking about.We sing Moon, Moon, Moon at night in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Standing!","review":"My childern ages 3&6 love this dvd!

I would highly recommend this to any one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have","review":"My kids go CRAZY for this DVD. Both my hubby and I love it also and seem to never tire of it believe it or not. I get up and dance for the 1st song with the triplets. poops me out. We sing different songs during the day when we see something that reminds us... WE LOVE the MOON song and Dinasaurs. that is a good one when we are out in public and I need to get kids attention and start them marching and following me.. I brought this for my son who had to go to hospital. While we were waiting, we watched on DVD player and he starts singing and dancing. I ended up donating to childrens department in order to help kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love this set, but....","review":"I purchased this set because I needed a bold extractor set. Problem is that I've tried to use it now on a half-dozen occasions - all were unsuccessful. All it did was make the worn out screws involved having a bigger gapping hole. This set has not worked for me at all - but you don't know until you try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT ENCOURAGEMENT","review":"My two year old is speech delayed and I purchased this video along with Brainy Baby ABC's. He loves it! I hear him imitating and saying the words and as a parent I am pleased to give him a break from the puppet based shows. I love puppet based shows just like he does but he doesn't miss them at all in this video. Looking forward to buying more....much better results and attention than Baby Einstein or Baby Bach. Two thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Video - Highly Recommend!!","review":"I have 18 month-old twin boys who are just beginning to talk and communicate with us. There are a few other videos (DVD's) out there for 'first words', but this has been the most complete. Not only does it cover a lot of common words, but it also teaches some concepts like (put on or pushing something).The boys really do like watching the real people and objects in each scene, and they appear to be taking everything in.I am not what you would consider a 'flash card mother', but I do appreciate constructive entertainment. This seems to really help both of them with their communication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!!","review":"Ok I have to say this is one of the best. I have a couple of the Baby Einstein DVD's for this age group and my son who is 28 months loves this Brainy Baby DVD. He'll look through all of our DVD's for it and pop it into the DVD player on his own and start watching it. He'll repeat about everything that they try to teach like with the numbers, colors, and words. The only draw back is that it's kind of long for a two year old. It's 45 min. He'll watch it for about 15 min, then he may go off and do something else and while it's still playing, he'll come back to the tv to start watching it again. All in all, this is a great educational DVD. Must have! Hey for the younger babies too; I have a 5 month old that loves classical baby by HBO, my 2 year old, loves that DVD too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Don't waste your money.","review":"I bought this video because I'm working with my son to try to get him to start saying some words. This video got great review, thus being the reason for my purchase of this specific product. It was so boring that it put my son to sleep! We watched it after he had gotten up from his nap, actually. It's no better than Baby Einstein - which is a great concept for the little ones - but not good for toddlers. My son can communicate very well receptively, which might be the reason for him not having any interest in this video. We bought a Baby Babble video which seemed to engage him much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD with variation","review":"I have 16 month old twin boys and they love this DVD. It moves at a great pace and holds their attention. It moves on to various learning topics and reinforces what they have learned. I also have Baby Einstein DVD's but I like the Brainy Baby products because they speak and also display words. All kids learn differently but this one works for me and my boys. I have 10 other episodes of Brainy Baby DVD's and I have to say this one is the best one if you only buy one to try them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not animated enough to keep baby's attention.","review":"I like the Brainy Baby line, but this video, although has great information, did not keep my one year old interested at all. At least with the My Baby Can Read and Sesame Street series she gets a little animation and songs while she is looking at the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brainy Baby English","review":"We couldn't be happier with the \\"Brainy Baby\\" learning DVDs, : they are doing what they said they would and more......Our Grand daughter has Tuberous Sclerosis and is just now learning to try and talk words and do all the things that children much younger, learn.

If you're a fan of classic Universal Studios-type atmosphere, look no further than \\"The Head\\". Pure unadulterated drive-in fare, \\"The Head\\" brings back fond memories of the 60's, when TV horror hosts like Sir Graves Ghastly and others would screen lesser-known gems like this one on Saturday afternoons.Alpha Video is to be commended for making stuff like this available for a reasonable price; if any criticism could be levelled at them, it's that the print was not particularly good, and it shows in the transfer. Still, the film itself will make you forget all about that..it's really good! The actor who portrays Dr. Ood is especially memorable, like Peter Lorre without all the mannerisms.

It's principle drawback is the songwriting that, at times, feels as if they were trying too hard to gain commercial success. No fewer than 4 singles were released from the album, and only 1 made it into the top 40 much less the top ten (as \\"Dust in the Wind\\" did from the last album). One of the tunes that didn't make it into the top 40 was, unfortunately, also this album's best cut: \\"A Glimpse of Home\\" is both powerful and dramatic without thrashing the listener. It's still worth buying, even though its four best cuts are all on the Kansas boxed set."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Sub Par Effort!","review":"With the exception of track one and the rocker \\"Stay Out of Trouble\\", this recording falls far short of the production and songwriting quality of previous efforts (Especially Leftoverature and POKR).A lot of pointless riffs and bombastic noodlings make this a hard listen, except for the most dedicated \\"can hear no wrong\\" fan of fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"kansas starts to change directions here","review":"Kansas was at this point still a fantastic prog rock band and now they would change their direction heading for a more straight on less prog feel. On this one which has the great hit 'people of the south wind' on it, which refers to kansas people who are hardy folk to be sure , the band still sounds fantastic but less proggy. This is a very strong cd by any means , strong songs abound here and fans of solidly made rock cd's should grab this one. It's just a portent of the early 80's type of band Kansas became though."},{"rating":"1","title":"shallow","review":"it an OK story. it has a conventional plot, not too hard to predict.

By combining elements of the past: the Salem witch trials and the present: the search for Weapons of Mass Destruction, The Demon Plague draws a picture of a frightening -- because it seems plausible -- future.

I've been very pleased with the performance in a very practical way - I take it, it plays, it doesn't \\"skip\\" and I don't have to listen to the (bad) music at the gym. The downsides are (of course) the batteries don't last too long and you only get about an hour's worth of music to load on (w/o upgrade). But i manage to get about 3 hours of operation (w/ rechargeable batteries - I recharge 2 batts once a week). I found initial loading of software not a problem, and changing mp3s is not a big deal. If you're an audiophile or extremely picky about things, don't get it. If you just want to go to the gym & \\"tune out\\". This will work fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing in terms of memory and ease of use","review":"I bought this when Amazon mailed me an e-mail advertising it...I've recently gotten into mp3s and was impressed by my friend who bought one of those mac-friendly Ipod devices. So I bought this after reading some positive reviews. Basically, here' the skinny: 1) the memory is tiny. 12, 13 songs, tops. 2) the software is clumsy and hard to use; it takes some tinkering to figure out. 3) It does burn through the single aaa battery pretty quickly; I use rechargeables (and so should you), so it's not that big a deal. 4) It is very tiny and portable. 5) it's short on buttons...you have to use 4 buttons (play, left-right, and a function button) to navigate every command. this is irritating if you want to shift to shuffle mode in mid-jog.So, if you don't mind having only 12 songs or so, and are comfortable with the software interface, I'd say go for it. Myself, I wish I'd bought a cd/mp3 player, despite the larger size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great!","review":"Sound is very good but I cannot compare with other players because this is my first mp3 player.

I ran 5 miles with my little Mini Yepp, most of the time I did not even realize I had it around my arm; it is so light and small. The rumors are true it burns batteries, but if you buy a battery recharger with the NiMH batteries your set. I was quickly able to pick up on how to use the buttons (After reading the mannuel). I was able to store over an hour on mine about 17 songs. I suggest you don't have the software scan your hard drive for music files the darn thing brought up every type of sound recording I had and put it in my playlist (6000+ files I had to sort through).

My other favorite new series is Alias - it was broadcast in HDTV and the DVD series was released in the original widescreen format (anamorphic for those of you who know what I'm talking about). I almost bought this series today, until I realized it wasn't in its original format. One of the greatest new series, but the lack of widescreen kills it for me!

We are being inundated with mother swaping, unruly children being tamed by a nanny, messy homes being organized and let us not forget Paris Hilton!! Do the producers think we are so brainless that we only need TV shows that require little attention span?

Although I had not lived through the 60s, watching Meg Pryor's ambition to dance on Philly's American Bandstand became mine as well. Sunday nights became my night to dance to those live performances many boomers remember so well. I bought the first season several years back and can not wait until NBC Universal comes to their senses in releasing the rest.Shame on you NBC for not giving \\"American Dreams\\" a fair shake with audiences, The theme \\"Generation\\" was written by Tonic's own Emerson Hart.

It's exciting in most ways, although it could be better. It has good graphics unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon which didn't have that. You can start off with $500,000.00 and less. You have to build your way up with exhibits and interesting scenery. You have to keep your animals happy with food, habitat, and space. On a scale from one to ten I'd give it an eight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente curso de ingles.

I know that the words 'fresh' and 'classic' don't often get paired up in descriptions, but they are always the first two that come to mind when I think about GN&SNS (Greg Naughton & the Stark Naked Sole for the uninitiated). Greg--who is the lead singer and songwriter--seems to channel some of my favorite pop and rock artists (Jeff Buckley, Stevie Wonder, the Counting Crows) with each song while still putting out an original sound. The result, both live and on the CD, is songs that are new and engaging, yet familiar. I give the CD 5 stars, and I mean it. Check out the free tracks; I don't think you'll be disappointed.

A plug cutter is a plug cutter right? Well not exactly.The hardwood floor I was installing included a White Oak border that was top screwed and plugged. I had a [hard] of a time making high quality plugs. The plug either broke off in the plug cutter (too short) or they burned leaving a visable ring on the floor.With my drill press set at a very low RPM I was finally able to make plugs that didn't burn but only when I used very tight gained plain sawn stock. By the time I figured out exactly which speed and which stock was best, the cutter was dull and produced burned plugs again. Argh!I ended up going to a local Woodcraft store and buying a [other tool] plug cutter. With its 4 cutting surfaces this cutter worked like a champ. Had I only spent the extra money on a high quality plug cutter I would have saved myself hours of aggravation.

Gone is the fast paced, non-stop action of 'The Crystal Shard,' or the roving adventure and excitement of 'Streams of Silver.' There is no suspence or anticipation as in the other novels - you know where the story is headed at all times, and you know how it will turn out. It's just a matter of trudging through the pages to get there.A stale ending to an otherwise fun and enjoyable fantasy adventure series...still the best of the TSR line of books, but the poor ending keeps it from getting on any other \\"best\\" lists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Best series ever!

Entreri, intrigued by Drizzt and wanting to prove that his moral code is the better, that by losing his goodness and bringing his body under absolute control, by honing his muscles to their finest fighting edge to the exclusion of all else, he has become a pure fighter, undefeatable. So he takes Regis and draws Drizzt into a fight he cannot avoid. I think, the most compelling thing about Salvatore's books is his beginning of section musings, a probe into the honorable and wise mind of Drizzt Do'Urden. And in his writing it is apparent that he sees these characters as more than just words on a page, he has done a masterful job of making us see the same thing. For breathing life into a book I will never tire of reading, I thank you, R.A. Salvatore.

I have said it like a million times now, but this is the coolest kung fu style I have ever seen anyone do on screen. Top 20 fight scene of all time, easily. 4/5GREEN DRAGON INN- pretty good fights and a good story. Cast includes Yueh Hua, Lo Lieh, Polly Shang Kwan, and Sze Ma-lung (The Shaking Eagle), and all give good performances. 3.5/5BLOODED TREASURY FIGHT-above average story, but not enough good fights.

It's hard-core noir all the way, especially when push comes to shove on a dangerous mountain road. But then Donleavy ends up in Larkspur, Idaho, apparently suffering from amnesia, and falls for a girl mechanic. From here on in the tone grows sentimental and \\"women's-picture\\"-ish.

I really like my new oblique muscles coming through. I think this DVD hits a few other areas as well, so I think it's more than abs.This video is the exact right length. I am not bored (like P90X) and I look forward to doing it.It's also super portable and easy to do in a hotel room (it's a good work out even without weights).I like Jillian's style and am looking forward to another challenge to mix it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value, I'd buy it again!","review":"This is actually my first foray into workout DVDs. I liked this one! Moves are innovative and I like it better than P90X ab ripper-- Jillian's workout can stand alone for your workout for the day, versus P90X can't. It takes about 35 minutes to complete. The moves are good-- I hadn't seen any of those before. It's difficult but that's good. I think this will help me get results, but I really gotta lay off the ice cream too :)The one minus is that there are only 2 workouts, level 1 and level 2. You're supposed to do level 1 fr 3 weeks and level 2 for 3 weeks. Right now I'm almost done with level one. I didn't need a weight for this because the moves are hard enough already, and to give you an idea I already run 2x a week for 3 miles and d vinyasa flow yoga once a week so I'm in okay shape.Thinking about buying 30 day shred now..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Workout...perfect level of intensity!","review":"Jillian's 6 Week Six pack is the perfect workout.

She might yell on that TV show but she does not act like that in her DVD's I actually find her pleasant and real. She has a good attitude she gives it to you strait but she also gives reason and praise. I am also following a diet that includes her shakes and fat burning pills as I do this workout five days a week with two days rest.

You get a full body workout, but it just so happens that it whips your abs into shape! I'm in OK shape, but after doing this video 3 times, I already noticed that my core had gotten much stronger! I haven't tried it every day for six-weeks, so I don't know if it really gives you a six pack in six weeks, but it's a GREAT addition to your workout regimen.

I feel ashamed but when I'm able to finish it I'm so glad I did it. This DVD is not as intense on the cardio side so I like it more. The way to work on the abs is really original, I did not find it so hard except for the side plank. I do pilates regularly so I guess I already have some strength in my core. Let's see tomorrow how sore I will be before bragging. I highly recommend this one and yoga meltdown to change from the more traditional workouts. I still have to try shred it with weights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good luck.","review":"I'm not terribly out of shape, but if you think you're going to pick this dvd up and have a 6-pack 6 weeks later, good luck.

We wanted to mix it up and maybe focus more on abs so we bought this DVD. After the VERY FIRST workout I ended up getting my very first exertion migraine and put a lot of stress on my neck and my husband pulled something in his knee which has now slowed him down in all of his other workouts. This workout is WAY too easy to get hurt doing and we won't be doing it again. We switched to Jillian's \\"No More Trouble Zones\\" to add some variety to the mix instead. This DVD is going into the resale pile immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok...","review":"It is pretty good compared to most workout dvds...and very intense...What I did like the most is that there was a way to start at a low impact level and work my way up to the Levels 2 and 3. I was able to decide how long to stay at each level. The thing I didnt like was the workout not having much abs workout.. The sound was good, and the quality was great....but there was no good music..that was fun to work out to... Good music definately motivates you to keep going even though it hurts... It is well worth the money,.."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice workout","review":"Love the workout it really worked the abs..seeing.results won't mind buying more Jillian Michaels i recommend this workout to anyone who wants to tighten up the middle and get a whole body workout"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Ab Routine","review":"I love ab workouts but sometimes feel the routines available on DVD are not challenging enough...but NOT this routine.

If you want a hardcore ab workout, this is not the video for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed! Not what I expected","review":"I LOVE Jillian's workouts, so I thought that this video would be all about abs and it would be great. It's NOT! It is fast paced cardio with some ab exercises. Not like her 30 day shred where she explains what she is doing, helping make sure you are doing the exercises correctly. You can EASILY get hurt with this video.

I own 6 week six-pack, 30 day shred, No more trouble Zones, Ripped in 30, and just purchased Body Revolution. I wanted to love this DVD, and I tried so hard to like it. I gave both workouts on the DVD several chances. Jillian seems a little rushed or distracted. She flies through the exercises with little to no explanation. Some of these moves really should not be done super fast because they could easily cause injury and she does not go over the proper form. Some of the moves are just strange and ineffective. I am just really disappointed and will probably never do this workout again.

Or do what I do, put it on turn the volume down and turn on your own music. You will be sweating and soar if you are a beginner trying this video for the first time. I did not last the six weeks because I got bored and honestly listening to Jillan tell me not to \\"phone it in\\" was ANNOYING. I use this dvd when I can't get to the gym and have very little time.

This workout left me sore, but not in my abs like I expected. My butt and thigh were sore from lunging and squating but my abs didn't hardly even feel fatigued. Also, my this workout left my neck sore for a couple days - I was not impressed with the safety of this workout. I consider my self in fairly good shape, as I'm training for a 1/2 marathon and am very active. But there are very few people, myself included, that will purchase this DVD that can safely swing a dumbbell around as fast as they can and maintain proper form and not injure themselves.

I think it is a great workout and I think it will actualy work for someone who is not very over weight if you want a 6 pack. Also you have to keep in mind that you should be eating healthy at the same time. If you have not worked out in quit awhile this is a bit tuff to get into at first. After a few trys I was able to kick myself into going through the whole video. I really enjoy her motivation and she keeps it very positive and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a believer","review":"This is a killer workout. I made it 10 days with level 1 and 3 days with level 2 before having to stop. My knees are killing me; I could barely walk afterwards. Sweat like a pig and no weight loss or inch loss. Will probably need a very strict diet to see any results.Jillian is very pleasant to listen to and very motivational. I believe in her workouts... just not for anyone with knee issues. If you are young, strong, can take constant pounding on the knees, then this workout will do you good. It is a challenge and a very difficult workout. But if you have any issues with high-impact workouts, or workouts that are killer on your knees, then avoid this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with Purchase","review":"I ordered this video to supplement those busy days I can't make it to the gym. This video works your entire core in 35 minutes by keeping your heartrate up and making you sweat. It's not difficult for beginners and demonstrates how to modify workouts for more/less intense workouts. Note: you need a mat. Also, if you are regularly active, you will want to have weights for particular exercises. Overall, a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Luck!","review":"If you want a lying on the floor, easy ab workout, this is not for you. This is a tough workout (level 2 anyways) that will burn the fat off of your body. Sure, it has some awkward poses that are difficult, but I take that as a challenge and am loving the results. It is a cardio workout, which some people seem upset about. Cardio burns fat people! You cant just do abs and get a flat stomach, you have to burn the fat off as well. Be sure to start with level one, unless you are already pretty fit. I will admit that even with being comfortable with insanity, this was a tough workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"this video is no joke!!!

I started to use the dvd for 1 week but it is very hard and I'm not able to make true some of the exercises...the results at the end of the week was my body over-stressed and no results at all. I started to use exercisetv.tv (Cindy Whitmarsh) and after two weeks I can see the results!I don't recommend this dvd at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have bad wrists or a bad back, forget it","review":"I used this from Exercise TV and I'm glad I didn't buy it. There were two exercises I couldn't do because of physical limitations. One, she has you rotating your torso from left to right using weights. I had to avoid it because I didn't want to break my already bad back. There was another one that I had to skip because it was hard on my wrists.I am not a lazy person who makes excuses not to work out. In fact, I love some of Jillian's other DVDs including, 'Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism.' Since other people are giving this DVD good reviews, I guess I'll recommend getting it only if you are in super-pristine shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"suitable for my purposes","review":"My stomach is 63 inches around hopefully this work.

I especially like that she does the workout too- it inspires you to work hard. There are two levels: the first you're supposed to do for 3 weeks and then move up to the 2nd level. I'll probably get tired of the same routine before then, but it's nice to have another level to move up to. Bottom line: challenging and nice flow without the dull, repetitive filler. Every move she does has a purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jillian Michaels-No more trouble zones CD","review":"I bought fourJillian Michaels CDs from this seller and today I was exercizing for the first time the No more trouble zones CD. When it was showing the mat exercise right before the stretching...this image of the CD became very shaky and got totally frozen for a couple of minutes then jumped to the end of the stretchexercise. I haven't started the other CDs yetbut I'm afraid that this situation can happen to the other CDs as wellI...after I watch the other Cds I will keep in touch with Amazon and a seller to see if they can replace the problematic CD. I hope the other ones are okay.I'm a little upset by the inconvenience.I hope to Amazon and the seller to fix the problem for me.I will keep you uptated with what will happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Not the JM I Expected","review":"I purhased this workout on Amazon instant video, I was so excited since I love the results I get from my other JM videos ( 30 day shred, no more trouble zones, boost your metabolism & extreme shed) but this video is my least favorite of all the ones I own.I can't quite describe it but something about this video feels awkward, and I could not wait for level 1 to end, not because I was drenched in sweat but because I was bored and pondering getting a refund for this video. I will try Level 2 today and see if my attitude about this video changes but for right now this is a no go for me.On a side note there were walkouts in level one which I have done plenty of times from 30 day shred but for some reason I hated doing these, I think they do them too fast so for the safety of your wrist I would ignore them and go at your own pace. I also hope this is not the future of what JM is going to be making, just churning out videos just for the heck of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This video kicks my butt!","review":"I am relatively in shape - so I remember thinking that Level 1 wasn't actually that challenging. However, the next day? I FELT IT! And even if you think \\"I'm totally in shape, so maybe this isn't for me\\" - you are wrong! Level 2 is a challenge for EVERYONE! It's a great combo of cardio and ab work - and only requires one dumbell, or one water bottle, if you're away from home a lot, like me. :) Worth the money many times over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to follow","review":"I enjoy this video and find it easy to follow. I first thought it was too easy and I am not very fit but doing it every day has helped. It is not about complicated or hard to do exercise but consistency.

Fast paced, intense, I love it. goes by quickly, seems like a long time but goes by fast"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jillian Michaels: 6 Weeks to a 6 Pack","review":"This is another great Jillian DVD but definitely falls short of the 30 Day Shred and No More Trouble Zones. That being said, it is still a great killer DVD. Don't be fooled by the beginner label as opposed to the intermediate. I am a fit individual who needs to work out more than I do and when I do this DVD it is exceptionally taxing in the area of muscular endurance. The cardio part of the DVD does not compare to the other DVDs and I hardly broke a sweat at the end of thirty minutes. The other DVDs offer a far better cardio/toning combination. This does not mean the DVD is not valuable. It is and when combined with the other Jilliam DVDs for a weekly variety it is a nice diversion."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!!!","review":"I'm a fan of Jillian from watching Biggest Loser and this DVD lived up to all my expectations. This workout provides just the right amount of ass kicking -good cardio and abs burning the next day. I love that the exercises are mixed up to keep it interesting and that the cardio is fast. I doubt that 30 mins, 5 times a week is enough to get Jillian's abs. Still, I think that this will make a great addition to any workout schedule."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Workout is a Killer!!!","review":"I got this DVD yesterday and I started doing the exercises right away... well, let me tell you, this is a killer workout! It has a different set of exercises and all of them are wonderful, I sill have to work in some of the moves since they are difficult (Like the side plank...ugh!!) but is just a matter of time to adjust my body. I also like that is only 35 minutes and intense, perfect for moms like me who don't have time for lengthy workouts but still want to get in shape. Right now I'm feeling sore but energized, I can't wait to get home and do my workouts, I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excited","review":"This is an amazing ab workout! Jillian gets your abs burning in the first two minutes of this DVD workout"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out!","review":"I love this DVD! This is my first ever from Jillian and she kicks your butt. She keeps you motivated and not annoying at all like other trainers. If some of you are like me I need a little tough love to get through my work out. I could really tell the difference in my body after doing this for a few weeks. I lost inches in my waist and arms. I highly recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Tough All-Around Workout, Not Just Abs","review":"6 Week 6 Pack is a great workout - I had fun doing both level 1 and 2, found them both very challenging (especially level 2) and I switch up between level 1 and 2 with other workouts. I often tack on 6 Week 6 Pack to a Ripped in 30 workout and find that I get a great 45-50 minute workout that leaves me feeling energized and accomplished. Something that I like about both level 1 and 2 is that they seem to go by really fast and I never get bored. Unlike the Shred workouts and other JM DVDs, the longer circuit keeps things interesting and doesn't feel repetitive. The only downside to this setup is that sometimes I'm dreading one move knowing that it's coming towards the end and I can't get it over with 'til then.I also felt that these 2 particular workouts added a new definition to my body (not just in my abs) that I hadn't had before. I use 4 lb. weights, and find that it provides me the right amount of resistance to the moves.Thanks, Jillian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"6week","review":"great work out. first time I've tried Jillian, I do P90x, Bob Harper, Billy Banks, Biggest loser. After doing this one I also bought her Shredded in 30 days and meltdown Yogi. My daugther who just started working out found this one a little to tough, but purchased jillian's dvds with the kettle ball that works for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best half hour workout I have found","review":"Jillian really knows how to design a workout so you get the most out of the time and don't get bored. The warmup up is really getting started with the workout. Then she runs through the circuit twice. After the first round, I have a good sweat going, and I am in good shape. The moves are easy to pick up and she never stops or slows down to teach first - you keep moving. Then the second round she double times it! The combination of cardio and core workout and good circuit design feels as though I've run four miles AND did ab work by the end. And Level 1 is not a whimpy starter workout. It is as fun and challenging as Level 2, so I switch off between them each week rather than \\"graduate\\" to only doing Level 2. Great job Jillian - this is my favorite workout to feel good in only half an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and fun!","review":"Just tried this workout for the first time today and loved it!! Works out your core but also adds in cardio moves that target your core, so you feel like your getting a full body workout. I hurt my back about a year ago and have been looking for a workout DVD that will help strengthen my core and back. This DVD was perfect, expecially because each move has a beginner level along with an advanced level. Jillian also states the importance of doing some back exercises whenever you are working out your core to help prevent injury. workout includes an awesome warm up and cool down. Definitley going to add this workout to my daily routine....loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very challenging!","review":"This video is extremely challenging. I own a few Jillian videos and this is by far, the hardest. I have worked out for years, I consider myself to be in pretty good shape, but I couldn't keep up, on either level. There are two levels and you are supposed to move on to the second level after 3 weeks. I took approximately 4 weeks since I only did the video approximately 2 times a week. Even though there are levels, you can still come back to this video when you feel like a complete ab and lower body work out. I was so exhausted from the cardio in the video I found myself cheating and not keeping up, but that's probably the point!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intense work out","review":"I normally get bored with workout videos, but somehow, Gillian manages to be not too irritating and also to keep my attention.

You can really feel your abs working! The fact that she adds cardio into the workout is fantastic! You can't see those abs if you have fat in the way and with the cardio she is allowing the fat to be burned and also working those ab muscles all in the same workout! Jillian has become my favorite! I haven't owned a dvd of hers yet that I do not like or wouldn't recommend! They are all great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick Butt Workout!","review":"This is what I have been waiting for- I have been doing the 30 day shred Level 3 for months. I am getting bored and wished Jillian would release a 'update' or 2nd 30 day shred. I bought this thinking it was an ab workout- I've done many and didn't think too much about it. Yesterday I did Level 1 and was sweating my butt off- It kicked my butt and I can do the 30 day shred, Power yoga and another hour of exercise in one workout- I did not think I would find another workout that would rival or beat the 30 day shred for intensity- Thank You Jillian- I am now going to start every workout with this DVD b/f I move on to anything else. Jillian: Keep them coming- I've lost approx 25 pounds using your DVD's!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"30 mins rocking workout","review":"Specially designed work-out which can sweat you enough in mere 30 minutes with jut small weights and mainly using your own body weight. It is more like a 30 minutes boot-camp with two levels of workouts in circuit training methodology. You gotta do the whole circuit twice, first one focused on doing it right and the second time, be fast, and push yourself as much as you can. No wonder Jillian Michaels is known as one of the best health coach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Post Pregnancy weight loss--especially if you don't have a lot of time","review":"I was not a Jillian Michaels fan before I bought this video--for no real reason, but I just did not know about her workout philosophy. I purchased this after unsuccessfully trying to commit myself to the Tracy Anderson post natal video. While it was extremely challenging, I did not have the time or energy during the day to workout for 60 minutes. I wished I had purchased this video sooner! Jillian is motivating and challenging. She's not the least bit annoying--and provides a great workout for a busy postpartum mom in 20 minutes. I was able to do this during nap times when going to the gym was not an option. I always felt great after and lost weight. highly recommend for the postpartum mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I exepected","review":"Admittedly, I don't like to spend time on my abs - maybe due to laziness, maybe due to the fact I HAVE spent time and effort on them and my stomach is still pouchy (I'll blame the kitchen on that). I'm a runner but dabble in weights (NMTZ) and yoga (including her DVD) so when I saw this DVD, I was VERY hesitant but figured I'd give them another go. Much to my surprise, it's a very thorough work out! It is exactly what I was looking for - a quick DVD I can get in before work, a full body course of exercises, and a tough enough work out to boost my ego for completing it. Well done Jillian, well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout","review":"I've only used Level one so far. I love it. I have 30 Day shred; Shred it with weights; Burn fat Boost metabolism; and No more trouble zones. This (and Shred it with weights) are the only 2 where I haven't made it past level 1.This workout works the entire body with lots of focus on the abs. Planks, standing ab work, floor work and cardio all in one workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Level 1 rocks, Level 2 sucks","review":"I have been doing this workout for about a month now, 4-5 times/week.I love Level 1 - makes sense, good flow, fun, energetic, accessible. I'm athletic, about 5'7, 135 lbs, and absolutely love this workout. I started out with no weight and not being able to complete all the moves, and now use weight and complete them without problem.Level 2 is not as good - silly moves, poor flow, lots of twisting on knees, little mat work, feels more like cardio than abs. I've tried it three times now and quit every time half-way because it's just not as good. If I have 30 minutes to put in an abs workout, I want an abs work-out.The DVD is totally worth it for the quality of Level 1 - I feel a huge difference in my core strength and upper body. Get it for Level 1, and splurge a little money on the 30 day shred instead of wasting time with the Level 2 abs workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I find Jillian very motivating and funny in this DVD. I consider myself in shape but doing this workout is a killer! I tried it once over the summer but only last for 3 weeks without making it to level 2.

I am obviously not expecting a 6 pack, but I know results will show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Woah!","review":"This is one of my first Jillian video, and I could feel it working, it was just a little much for me.

Her workouts are challenging, but they are basic moves that anyone can master. That is the case with this video as well. They are basic crunchs, sit-ups, and moves that work every muscle in your core. I have a hard time doing this workout, and I have to push myself to keep going. I'm always happy when I'm done because I can feel it in every core muscle.If you are looking for a strong video that does what it promises, this is the one for you.

She is a much stronger vocalist than this outing allows her to be.She tackles her dad's \\"Big River\\", and does and admirable job on it, but I'm a bigger fan of \\"Take Me, Take Me\\", \\"This Has Happened Before\\" \\"Baby, Better Start Turning Them Down\\" and \\"Anybody's Darling\\".The recording is sub-par though.

Lionel Atwill stars as a deaf-mute accused of murder. As in most low budget efforts, unintentional humor is prevalent. Atwill uses sign language to communicate. He wiggles his fingers while holding his hands palms down at waist level. This makes it appear he is vigorously playing an invisible keyboard. Once or twice wouldn't be so bad, but this takes up time through much of the film. Only his assistant, a real red herring, can interpret Atwill's thoughts. Packaged as a horror flick, the little scenario is a murder mystery with typical plot twists. A snappy newspaper couple, '30s style, trade verbal barbs as they work to solve the mystery. Luigi the janitor swears the deaf mute spoke to him as he left the crime scene. This serves as comic relief and an intriguing plot twist. The DVD transfer is average. The audio is about the same. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"ATWILL SHINES!!!!!","review":"Lionel Atwill always stands out in any role and this film is no exception.

The aspect ratio is goofy on most of them, making everyone look stretched out. Some of the tapes even run out before the movies end! All in all, not worth the money - even at the good price they have here.This set contains - Hell'z Windstaff, Faster Blade - Poisonous Dart, Wu Tang Clan, Invincible Armor, Iron Man, Killer Priest, Wu Tang Swordmen, Godz of Wu Tang, Son of Wu Tang, Shaolin vs. Wu Tang 2, and 'Ol Dirty Kung Fu"},{"rating":"1","title":"playset worthless, magnetic spidey fun until it lost head","review":"my niece loved the magnetic spidey, though we paid alot for the playset, it was absolutly junk. My niece loved sticking magnetic spider-man to the metal door edge and refrigerator, until the head fell off outside when she was running around. the whole family searched for two hours but we never found the head.

My grandson finally said \\"...put Spiderman and New York City in the garbage.\\"Don't waste your money. As you can see from these reviews too many of us have already wasted enough money on this.

It has the potential to be a fun toy, unfortunately it is a flimsy toy. If you barely breathe on it it falls over, even on hardwood floors. On carpet it just plain won't stand up. The city back ground won't stand up either. And of course they try to make it work and then get aggravated with it. My eight year old grandson's had two broken pieces when he opened it. His mother took it back to [the store] and they did not have any in the store so he picked out a different toy.

My son said he really wanted this, so he got it, but we are very dissapointed in the construction and the performance of it.Not to mention the cost!

This toy not only doesn't stand up to a 5 year old, it barely even stands up. Its base was poorly designed. Did they actually let some kids test this toy first??? You know real kids, not adult wanna be-s. They only thing that my son liked after 15 minutes of trying to keep the playset upright while using the web was the Spiderman magnetic character(not worth 35$ alone). Toy Biz should've just made this figure available for sale by itself (the reviews would've been better). Don't waste this incredible amount of money for a hunk of junk. Believe what these people say.

Upon opening the box up, We found spiderman with a missing hand( that was found in teh bottom of the box) trying to put together the toy was other fun time for both my husband and I. The only way that I got the bridge to hold together was by using twist ties for other toys from xmas. I feel really bad for my son who just LOVES spiderman.

The music is ultra-cheesy, as are the sound effects, the dialogue, the animation, the characters, and the plot. On the upside, my five-year old son seems to like them, and there is a sense of satisfaction that he enjoys the same sort of thing I did when I was young.

Some of it is interesting - he recommends LLCs repeatedly, and just coincidentally happens to have someone in New Mexico who can hook you up.

I don't recall a single mention of flash memory drives.In the earlier chapters of the book, many of the author's suggestions sound like dubious brainstorms he hasn't tested. He also explains how to title a car under an LLC, then says you should insure it in your own name, with the LLC name on the insurance. This would link your name to the LLC and everything it owns. Worthless advice.There are a few valuable nuggets in the book, but for the most part it's junk. In several places, the writing is so bad that I couldn't figure out what he was talking about.

Planning ahead is clearly important so I am glad I haven't waited until an emergency before starting my education. Also, I looked up the author's website where I have found more timely discussions of current privacy questions and topics that would probably be out of date before a publisher could get another edition out anyway.

I did an exchange and shelled out another $20 bucks thinking that maybe this one would be better since the 3 speed version swivels. SHAME ON ME! It took only about 20 days to break the handle in the same spot on this one. I was turning the handle to manuver around a corner and hit the corner with the edge of the Shark and off broke the handel in the SAME SPOT!

Well, I decided to go ahead and buy one (from Sears with the extended warranty where they will just replace the whole unit). Brought it home, assembled it, and wouldn't you know, that handle is worse then everybody made it sound to be. I never did get it to work. But like I said, I really wanted this to work, so I was envisioning putting duct tape or super glue around it to make it work. Which, I probably would have done if I could have gotten the battery to charge. The battery would not charge regardless of what I did. Needless to say, it is back in its box and headed back to Sears.

The last one I had was the new one with three speeds, but the battery would not stay charged and eventually it quit totally. Which is disappointing since I owned it less than a year.

It picks up all the dirt by the baseboards and the doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible battery life","review":"Good sweeper when it works. Battery life makes this sweeper a mistake to have.

It was light and easy to use; but, it doesn't last long. The top of the handle broke off after one year (just in time that the warranty won't cover the repair). Then the entire handle (stick portion) snapped off. This product is not made to last. Its life span is less than 2 years. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I returned this after two weeks. It wouldn't pick up much.

It works really well for an apartment, it doesn't take up a lot of room like the big vacs take. I love that it has the three different speeds so I can also use for the lino too!! It works great for cleaning the food my son throws onto the carpet from his highchair!! I just made my sister get one for her new apartment also. I highly reccomend this vacuum!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This is a piece of rubish! I bought it, charged it for little more than 22hrs, and it could not even pick up the birdseed our bird messes on the floor! It is a wate of money, time, energy and gas, taking into account that I returned it the day after I bought it! The \\"floor\\" setting for harwoodfloors is pathetical, and then when you put it on \\"carpet\\", it at least picks up some of the dirt. I would not even give it to the Iranian presidant as a gift, let alone buy another one of these \\"cordless stick vacuums\\". They only seem to work on TV, NOT at your home. I cannot but wonder if there is not some or other \\"trick photography\\" behind those TV ads on this kind of junk. I had to give it one star, personally, I would give it ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weak to do any pickups","review":"After reading all the reviews, I thought I'd give this a try. Going in I already have \\"low\\" expectation. It's not a vacuum and it's not going to pick up a lot of dirt. But I figure, it's portable and cordless so in a pinch it's not so bad.I followed the direction to charge it first before use. A full 24 hours just to be safe. Right of the bat, I was disappointed. We have laminated wood floor so it's easy to see the lint and dust getting push around by the sweeper. I even tried the highest setting and still no noticeable result. All that's difference between the speed levels is the noise volume gets louder!This fish is getting thrown back!p.s. As I clean it and packaging it for return, I notice that the dust clings to the plastic surface of the sweeper like mad. You'd think they design it so that it's easy to clean - inside and out. My 10 year old vacuum cleaner doesn't attract dirt like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Euro Pro Shark 3 Speed Cordless","review":"The Shark offers a great product for multiple uses. We have 2 of their cordless sweepers - one in the kitchen and one in the basement. The Shark is used regularly to pick up debris in the kitchen - dirt, corn flakes, leaves, etc. When I am in a bind I pass it over the carpeting in other rooms as well. I has that much power! I have never run out of a charge on the battery. As directed, I make sure that I run the battery down before recharging. I have faith in anything with the Shark name on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had a bad impression of this item.

I also have a bad back and sweeping with a broom is hard. I am constantly sweeping up cereal/crackers/etc and was hoping this machine would be the end of it. I am very sad to report it was a waste of money. The commercial is totally deceiving. It shows it picking up everything, even bolts. This machine does not even pick up Kix cereal. It takes twice as long to use as a broom and dustpan. Also the customer service department is a joke. They are extrememly unhelpful and very rude. Do yourself a favor, learn from my mistakes and don't buy ANYTHING that says Euro pro or Shark on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I too was bitten by the Shark","review":"Sad to say I did not listen to good advice, since I had owned a Shark many years ago and it preformed very well for a few years then finally died.I since had purchased a new vacume and had been useing it. After realizing I was getting tired of dragging out the electic vaccume I searched for another Shark, well I got his one and it worked for about two weeks. It looses power very quickly, about 5 minuteds after starting it up. I have tried charging it and putting it away, it looses all power within a day, then if I keep it plugged in it still only holds up to a very short running time.I am pleased with what it picks up. I am throwing it away because, no matter how well it picks up if it will not stay running it is of no use to me. Wish it would have been as good as the old one I purchased many years ago.From now on I will listen to reviews. Thanks for the warnings.Refused to listen, Janice Kirkwood, Gary, IN"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I've had this for some time now. Maybe it's just me. For the $60 I paid the only good thing was the large container. But the container is very messy I think. It says you need one hand, but it gets stuck in there in this corner. It doesn't pick up dust bunnys, it actually pushes them away from the front as I get closer to them. It's the strangest thing. I find myself chasing them around. If it does catch up to them it will just push them out the back. So now I have to go back over them again and again. I'm going to buy the Swivel Sweeper again & it's half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grabber","review":"I have both wood & carpet floors & this puppy is so easy to use & clean out & I love it.

I'd rate this tool a three star.I now make only limited use for the sweeper. It's not very good on hardwood or rugs because it doesn't have enough power. It's only good for light work. I use it to sweep up cat sand and to sweep a couple of large rubber mats in the kitchen. It's perfect for that.The battery is meant to run completely down before recharging. I had to take the first machine back because of the battery but the second machine is working fine now that I'm careful to let the battery run all the way down. I only use the top speed even though it reduces battery life faster.For light work, it's a good tool. For more demanding work, forget it.Update: This guy turned out to be a bust!

What a junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"battery replacement","review":"The sweeper itself is a pretty good sweeper as long as the original battery works. But try to replace that! I placed an order on Jan. 7th and ordered two battery packs. One must order the battery replacement from the manufacturer- it is not available from any other source. it is not until the order is made that you learn that it will take 3 to 4 weeks to fulfill the order. In my case over three months have elapsed and still no batteries. So my sweeper is permanently out of order. I am furious and will never again order any other euro-pro product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, it's a SWEEPER , NOT a Vacuum!","review":"For the negative reviews, you should have bought a vacuum. This is a cheap sweeper. It works for simple sweep-ups. You should own a vacuum for decent carpet cleaning. Handle broke fairly easily. Battery life got very short after several months.

Then he explained more and i just realized how stupid i was. Carlin is always making you step back as a human being to look at yourself and people as a whole.

But you will be having one big SCREAM DREAM if you do [haha].This one shows how Ted really needed Derek St. Holmes to help him sound good. He finally figured it out, but way too late.

The scent is not overpowering like some others I've purchased, but it does last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great scent but weak wick","review":"I love the scent of this candle but not the wick.Somehow, Yankee Candle's wicks are becoming weak. As a result, the flame was very small, generating insufficient heat. After burning my candle for two hours, the wax pool is still making its way to the glass jar. As a result, some wax never gets to release the fragrance it contains. I would estimate a loss of 50% of the candle that could not be burned because of the weak wick. I experienced the same issue with several of Yankee candles over the past 5 years. This phenomenon seems to be random. I wonder if there is a batch to batch variation with the wicks that Yankee Candle sources from its suppliers. It's a serious quality issue that Yankee should address.In summary, I love the scent but am very disappointed with the quality of the candle."},{"rating":"1","title":"yankee candle large","review":"this candle has a very strong wax in the air. it smell good though. if you have a big room like maybe 20x20 it might be ok. but my room was 13x12 and it was overpowering with the smell of wax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Live recording","review":"I didn't know it is live recording version.

I really expected a lot more and this movie just does not deliver. The advertisements claimed it was scary, I didn't find it scary at all. In fact, it's just downright dull from the beginning and the ending makes no sense. So, if you get this movie expecting to be scared witless, forget it. Sorry, that's just my opinion on this one.

So one night at blockbuster I decided to rent it and give it a chance because I remember seeing the previews on tv and it did seem interesting. I decided that the only way that I was not going to be dissapointed by this movie was to set my expectations very low....or better yet, not have any at all.Despite this, I was not only dissapointed by this movie, but I found it to be very annoying. The acting was horrible and what the f*** is up with everybody mumbling one second then screaming at the top of their lungs the next. I found that to be very unerving. There weren't any scary moments and there was nothing original about the story. You never really feel like anyone was in any real danger throughout the entire movie, and everything is left unexplained in the end.

I Loved Anna Paquin in the X-Men movie's, but in this movie she along with the rest of the cast overacted their parts. There was no suppense whatsoever, you could see it comming from a mile away. In my most humble opinion do not buy or rent this movie, if you want to see a father go crazy and want a good horror flick watch the shinning again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, poor delivery","review":"I will try not to be too specific here so as not to ruin the movie for those that have not seen it.I was so disappointed with this movie. Anyone interested in seeing this may want to wait until they can get a used DVD for under $5.00. The plot hiccups through the entire movie as the characters bumble about trying to convince themselves that \\"everything is okay\\". Then, all of a sudden, they are magically aware of the problem and what is going on after stumbling onto a clue that reveals all. Also, the breakup of the movie into \\"days of the week\\" segments seems like the director was trying to bank on the concept used in \\"The Ring\\". Things don't even pick up until the last day and then, just as things are starting to get interesting, it is over. In other words, the movies starts with a fizzle, and ends with a plop. The acting was good, however, with Lena Olin giving a first rate performance. It was a shame to see such good talent wasted on such a dry movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not watch this movie.","review":"Darkness had been shelved by Dimension films for a while. They made a nice trailer and pumped it out during Christmas when people would be to busy to go searching for reviews.

After watching this movie, I felt like I had been hustled. Like all the idiots who buy a thighmaster or go on the Atkins Diet. There is not one thing good about this movie.

This movie like many have said makes no sense and is very very very slow! It is a waste of anyone's time and like I said before the only thing scary is Anna Paquin. Her acting is really horrible(how did she win an Academy award and continue to make movies!?) she plays the same character in all the movies she's in! It was pretty much her lame take on X-Men's Rogue in a horror film. All weak and pathetic and always crying and screaming about something! She plays this in all her films except Almost Famous, Walk on the Moon(well half-way in this), and All the Rage(in those 3 she plays a slutty wannabe girl and acts the same in all of them!) She only knows how to act as those 2 types I listed above!

Forget Dawn of the Dead, They, Cabin Fever, even the new Texas Chainshaw Massacre, this one tops the \\"scream chart\\".There're some questions still but hopefully they'll make a sequel to tie the loose-ends. I can't stop praising of this movie, just go see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD version is well worth seeing","review":"Guess I'm lucky I didn't see the theatrical release (quite a mess by the sound of it) because I thought the DVD version was just as effective in the 'creepiness' and 'dread' categories as Ringu or Ju-on. And director Balaguero thankfully eschews the cliche happy ending that undermines many North American horror films. His use of sound, light and shadow is incredibly assured for someone making only his second movie. If you are at all a fan of classy, well-made scare films, the DVD version of Darkness is well worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hope Someone Somewhere Is Very Ashamed","review":"'Darkness' is hands down the worst film of the year. It is boring as all get out and probably the least scary horror film I've ever seen. The script is laughable and the acting horrid. Not to mention that every person in this movie is horridly ugly.

Seeing it said on the back, that it was the 'thriller of the year' I decided to rent it. Boy was I ever disappointed. The movie got off to a VERY slow start and the movie only seemed to get started somewhere near the middle. After that, it just went downhill. The characters never seemed to actually connect they just spoke at one another as they passed through scenes. None of the characters came off as sympathetic. I felt like actually rooting for them to be killed off. The ending is equally anti-climatic. Overall, a boring, not at all scary movie.

The crux of the movie is based in Demonology, nameless evil and the inevitability of the past. That is the differance is what puts so many people off, I for one am a big fan of the pychological horror genre. This is definately a movie that should be watched in the dark and with very little else going on in the house. It is hampered at parts by over dramatic acting and some convuluted ideas, but most of it points towards the abstraction of what evil is and how it manifests itself (ie the fathers madness. The cinematography is excellent and the use of light and darkness puts this head and shoulders above the current crop of high priced horror stories, and just puts movies like ring 2, saw, and darkness falls to shame.If you liked Angel Heart, Fallen, or the all time most disturbing Eraserhead, then you will like darkness"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD TERRIBLE THE WORST SPANISH HORROR MOVIE","review":"This is not scary.

It doesn't make any sense, It's anything but scary, nothing is resolved in the end, and it tries everything it can to rip off The Ring, which also sucked. I'm almost at a lost for words.

Anyway, instead of relying upon real creepiness, they've chosen to use sound to make you jump (didn't work once for me), whether it be a slight burst of music or thunderclap, it gets to the point where you can expect it and predict it before it happens. They've also chosen to borrow a scene from The Shining (mother with a knife in the bathroom with young son, while crazed father is trying to break down the door)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speak up Mumbles","review":"This has to be one of the worst movies of alltime.They are either mumbling,or screaming.I turn up the tv because I can't hear it,or understand what they are talking about.. the next thing I know,they are screaming atthe top of their lungs or cursing.The sound goes from low to high before you can grab your remote.Thin plot,poor acting,audio is horrible..yuk.It started out from the getgo as a bomb.Just what the heck is this movie about??

The trailer looked so good as well as the synopsis, which is why I felt cheated after I watched it. A convoluted story, poorly defined characters, and a less than stellar ending makes this movie a dud.

It suffers from what Roger Ebert calls \\"The Idiot Plot\\": If any character during the course of the film says or does one thing, then the whole film will stop.Numerous times the Anna Paquin character could have done something simple to stop \\"The Darkeness\\" (including using a flashlight at times). In fact, all the characters act like they are on Ecstasy. And why would the police not know about this house??Also, the movie is supposed to be about a haunted house, except that the ghosts seem to like traveling on trains and driving around in old Volkswagens, alot.A very strange horror movie failure .."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed....","review":"I saw this in the theatres when it came out. While the cinematography is impressive and very inventive in places, I didn't enjoy the movie at all. I rented this version hoping that it would clarify the muddy plot, but it didn't - it just adds cursing and some stupid swim club scenes. The actors and actresses are shrill and irritating, but most importantly, the plot makes absolutely no sense at all. There are three mysterious women who seem to be present only to scare the viewer - NO explanation is ever given to who they are. And when the villain tries to explain WHY ON EARTH he would do the things he's doing, his only explaination was \\"it's science.\\" All of the characters do idiotic things and the movie is MUCH less scary because it's just downright stupid. It's obvious that the filmmakers only cared about making the movie LOOK scary than coming up with a decent plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bright spot in DARKNESS","review":"Request to filmmakers: PLEASE develop a new idea, NOW! No more haunted houses that make men go nuts, while the female comes to the rescue. No more quick unique edits that now mimic every horror film from the past two years. And, pretty please, no more \\"twist\\" endings that appear to be nothing more than a writer and director not knowing which direction they want to take the movie.And for as bad as the Unrated Version is, I can't imagine how dull the [PG-13] Version must be."},{"rating":"1","title":"darkness should've never seen light","review":"horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! plotless!!!!!!!!!!!! stupid!!!!!!!!!!!!

First off I assumed the movie was scary because of the name and the many movie trailers I see on television.

When characters behave counter to humans everywhere, when the director throws in a white boa constrictor just because (I imagine) somebody on the set knows where to get one, when the particular rules of the movie's world are set aside for the sake of a chilling moment, when the \\"revelations\\" in the plot come about 20 minutes after they are painfully apparent, then, sad to say, the movie flops.

Haunted House movies are always fun if they're creepy. The story is extremely stupid. Filmed in Spain by a Spanish director and crew I assume to save money ala Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti westerns. How they rangled Anna Paquin in to this is a mystery to me. There are some interesting moments that are creepy but nothing you haven't seen before.

The dubbing is pre-Godzilla level, causing what little dialogue it has to be truncated.I give it zero stars but to post a review I have to plug in the minimum 1 star.I went to see Anna Paquin whose work I have loved since 1993. It is her talent I love, none of it given a chance in this disaster.Now 22 she is a robust beauty like Scarlet Johansson is, but without the unnecessary glamour component; and as contrasted with fragile beauties such as Nicole Kidman or Cate Blanchett.Why she selected this flick, dunno.

Even the end, when you'd at least expect the tediousness of it all to pay off, it doesn't. Avoid this one. There are plenty of other good horror movies out there.Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.

But horror fans, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL DARKNESS","review":"Filmed in 2002 but not released in the US until 2004, DARKNESS is a disappointing ghost story. While the movie is visually impressive with atmospheric and brooding tension, it does little to serve the muddled script and the acting is hysterically inept. For toppers, why and what is the DARKNESS? Why did seven people sacrifice their children for it? What were they trying to accomplish? And as talented as Giancarlo Giannini may be considered, why was he given the crux of the story's plot when he has such a thick accent that unless you turn on the subtitles, you have no idea what he's talking about. And the ending is so anticlimactic, you have to be a little ticked off you wasted your time with it. I keep hoping that the horror genre gets some new life in films that don't end up being so dull and lifeless as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed potential","review":"What is wrong with the DARKNESS is that there is nothing to be afraid of. It seems that everybody on the screen is, but when we see what the reason is it ellicits more of a shrug than a shriek. This movie carefully builds up its premise with a spooky legend of a cult that sacrifices children that was unable to complete its ritual to ressurect an ancient demon. But when the story should climax with a hair raising finale it simply fades to darkness. Also the restrained lanquage in light of the horrific situations was laughable. A case of style over substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"got this at a good price :) this a good horror movie if you didn't see it you should check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...terrible....terrible.","review":"An American family move into a house in Spain where forty years earlier the father was almost killed by a cult. Six other children were slaughtered, but he got away.The odd thing is he moves back into the house without mentioning he was almost killed in it. What? The other thing I didn't get about this movie is there is no real explanation as to what the evil that this cult wanted to unleash was. Is it a demon, or a spirit? Don't know, neither did the screenwriter, director or producer.The acting in this movie is over the top and just terrible. It is so bad that it takes away from the drama, plus the whole family does nothing but scream at each other and there is nobody to cheer for as you end up hating them all.Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of Holes","review":"I figured I'd give this director another chance after the so-so delivery of \\"The Nameless\\". He's 2 for 2 - completely mediocre. Not nearly enough depth in SO many areas throughout the film and it had such potential! There were a few 'spooky' scenes in the film, but just when you think something's going to happen to scare you out of your wits - nothing. The few weak references to the supernatural or the occult aren't enough to keep a real horror enthusiast entertained. As for the tech stuff, this one's in English, but it's clearly overdubbed in some areas and not in others. The lighting is pretty bad - I found myself straining to make out details.

Do yourself a favor and watch the Grudge instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great production values but no story....","review":"This is another case of a beautifully done film falling way below expectations because of a weak script. The cinematography, set design, lighting is all wonderful. The acting, such as the script allows, is also pretty good. The script however leaves much to be desired.There really isn't a plot other than the standard - House bad. House wants to eat you. House wins because of stupidity of actors. And the only time you have any sort of clue as to what is going on is when one of the actors gives a speech (thank you Mr. Exposition).If you really want to see the film, rent it once since that's more than enough times to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brian Yuzna should have steered clear","review":"Brian Yuzna should have avoided being associated in any way with this waste of celluloid."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent, narrowed focus which probes the outer solar system alone","review":"Mark Littmann's Planets Beyond republishes the updated, revised 1990 edition to survey the outer planets; from the history of their discovery to modern scientific findings about the planets including Voyageur results.

She runs away but it's too late cause she's already tempted/possessed and soon goes bonkers.Her rejection of Christ rampage starts out innocently enough with Maria throwing her prayer book on the floor and a little sinful licking, but before you know it she's killing other nuns and even rapes the stable boy before killing him! Hell yeah!Maybe not as wild as some (CONVENT OF SINNERS) in the \\"nunsploitation\\" genre, but definitely more entertaining than others (THE SINFUL NUNS OF SAINT VALENTINE).

Very few of his movies are subtitled and a movie like 'Interiors' is especially frustrating to follow because of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Witty Woody Allen...an excellent collection of his best!","review":"This collection features some of the best of Woody Allen. Bananas was simply outrageous fun along with Everything You Wanted to Know About Sex.\\"Sleeper\\" is a look at life in 2073 a la Woody Allen. This too was a fun movie. \\"Annie Hall\\" and \\"Manhattan\\" were perfect depicting life and love in New York City. I am hoping to see Stardust Memories and Interiors soon since I just received this collection. If you admire the work of Woody Allen then this collection is for you.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential DVDs, but...","review":"As a huge Woody Allen fan, it is troublesome to me to have to give this collection less than a 5 star review. After all, Manhattan and Annie Hall are landmarks of American cinema, and no Woody Allen movie has ever been less than interesting. However, I feel five stars just aren't justified by the packaging. As is the case with the earlier Stanley Kubrick collection, one of our great directors is treated to what is essentially just a standard DVD, with none of the special features found in, for example, the Taxi Driver Special Edition, any of the Criterion Collection DVDs, or even the Austiin Powers movies! Still, these are great movies by a great director, and should really belong in any serious collection. It just feels like a great opportunity has been missed here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have for you collection","review":"This 8-DVD set is a great deal. The sound and picture are very good-or at least adequate for a Woody Allen movie, the booklets are informative, and the discs have the option of widescreen or pan-and-scan, not to mention the fact that these are wonderful movies. They chronicle the development of a filmmaker from slapstick (Bananas) to drama (Interiors) to the incorporation of both elements (Stardust Memories). If you're a fan of Woody Allen's, there's no reason not to get this. And if you're not sure if you're a fan, there's still no reason not to get this set-it should win you over. I'm just hoping we'll see his Orion releases on DVD sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Woody Allen Collection - 8 pack","review":"Great collection of early Woody Allen titles.

I started reading reviews to determine if I should combine the 3 sets and get rid of the rest but after reading some of the reviews I felt the need to add my 2 cents. Like it or not Woody Allen does comedy, not drama. His attempts at drama, while not disastrous are far from overwhelming and now knowing more about the man and his pedophile/incest like behavior makes some of his films down right icky.Still this set has some of his greatest comedies and is the best set of the lot. For those who feel as Woody Allen felt in Stardust Memories, look back and you'll see his comedies are his best work the drama have either been written off as bad imitations of great films or forgotten almost completely.I probably won't breakup the sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy collection of the director's work","review":"Just about anybody can enjoy a Woody Allen movie; it simply requires all your attention and intellect while viewing it. This collection shows Allen as a comedy director (Bananas, Sleeper) and his transition to deeper, more bittersweet films (Annie Hall, Manhattan). An excellent job by MGM, though Annie Hall is the only non-anamorphic title in the bunch. I look forward to more Woody Allen film collections on DVD in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and instructive","review":"A funny movie about US interventions in Latin America. It is a comical rendering of the Cuban revolution in thinly veiled disguise. Allen's dry humor is evident throughout and highly enjoyable. While this is a movie intended to be funny, it is useful to understand the politics of the time. Here one can understand the idealistic outlook of the peace movements as well as the narrow minded perspective of mainstream politicians and bureaucrats! Both sides were mistaken! Highly recommended especially to those too young to remember those times.For all its value as described above, the movie lacks the energy and the punch lines of the best Allen movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectual Crap","review":"If I hadn't had to view this film for a course, I probably would have never watched it. I think Woody Allen movies are a love/hate thing, and I am on the \\"hate\\" end. The humor is pseudo-intellectual the way Woody Allen movies are known to be. There is also some ridiculous slap-stick humor, that I think may be attributed to the era it was filmed. The one memorable scene is at the beginning of the movie where Howard Cosell gives a play-by-play of the assassination of \\"El Presidente\\". Otherwise, this movie is good for one thing - discussing political humor for a university course.

If it is in a confusing or illogical format or doesn't hold attention, there is no point in producing it. It is very clear that Sylvia didn't use a ghostwriter for this installment of her Journey of the Soul series. The writing is tedious, plodding, and lacks transitions and a consistent tone. I'm still slugging through the book, but it's not as easy as it has been in the past when Sylvia has used a professional writer to assist her.

The small group of Brits there run an ivory trading business. Into this outpost comes a young man and his fiancé, played by Janet McTeer. The fact that they are not married and she is quite a bit older than him is not lost on the small group which consists of a matriarchal woman who runs the business, her demented adult son and his aging and slightly crazy former nanny played by Olympia Dukakis. There's also a priest who seems to have spent too many years there and a criminal-type nephew who would like to run the business. The setting is dark and mysterious and the story is somber. There's cruelty, murder, insanity and suicide without one bit of lightness in the constant gloom. Yes, the acting is excellent and that is what made me keep watching, but it's such a dismal view of the world that there is no way I can recommend this film to anyone.

It is simple, intuitive, and works well. One nice feature is that the remote receiver stores in the hand-held remote unit itself; and, once stored, it prevents the laser pointer from being activated. So, no problem with the battery being rundown while the unit is packed in a briefcase.On the downside, you do need to use a small phillips screwdriver to change the battery. The CR2032 battery is sometimes hard to find, so carry a spare.As a college instructor, this unit really helps in the classroom. I would recommend it to anyone that needs a simple PowerPoint remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work in Presentation View.","review":"Yeah, they claim this thing works with MS Powerpoint. But what they do not tell you is that it only works with PART of Powerpoint. It only works in Slide Mode. It does NOT work in Presentation View mode. Of course, most of my presentations are run in Presentation View mode.SO the remote is useless. And they have no fix for it. They cannot even document that this is the case.I am going to look for something else. Maybe the Microsoft Remote.***UPDATE***It's true, this presenter has problems with PowerPoint's Presenter View because in that mode PgUp and PgDown keys are used to scroll the notes. However, here's a neat trick I discovered that makes it work again:- Start the presentation in Presenter View- Pres \\"B\\" on your keyboard to show a blank screen- Click the mouse (anywhere in the blank screen) once to resume the presentation and then AGAIN to advance to the next slide- Magically, from this point on the presenter buttons work flawlessly."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS USELESS FOR MY NEEDS","review":"I thought it was going to be able to work as a mouse.

I can put my attention where it belongs---on my audience---and not be constantly focusing on my computer.Beyond what others have said, people might find it useful to know that the remote works nicely with Linux (I use pspresent). Also although I have seen other speakers use smaller devices, this one fits nicely in the hand (good curves) or in a pocket.Radio range is not quite what is promised, but it never is.Only 4 stars because my device seems to work only sporadically---I have had it suddenly stop working in the middle of a presentation. Replacing the battery did not help. But I just bought a second one, and so far that seems to work much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!

It has functioned on many different laptop and desktop systems. The ability to blank the screen from the remote is very helpful. It is compact and fits well in your hand. The lock-out feature that prevents operation during storage is very helpful in preserving the battery. It is a very good value for the price.The only aspect that took some getting used to was the location of the laser pointer button. Because of it's close proximity to the forward and reverse toggle, I have on a number of occassions pressed the forward button thinking I was pressing the laser button. However, this only took a short while to get used to (other remotes have the laser button recessed on the bottom and this was not an issue).I highly recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe this is a good item but I never got the chance to see...","review":"I ordered this item and spent the extra money for rush shipping, as I wanted to use it for a lecture that was coming up.

Eventually (two weeks after I posted my rush order) I got an email excuse that was poor at best. The customer service for this company is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful product","review":"I have been looking for a laser pointer/remote control but never found one that I really like. I am impressed with this product. It is really handy and easy to operate. If you are like me, that gets a little bit \\"too excited\\" during your presentation, this product is perfect for you. Some other products with remote control are more difficult to operate and you can easily skip one or two slides during your presentation. With the Kensington wireless laser pointer that will hardly happen to you. It has the perfect size and fits well in my tiny hands. The laser bean is way better and clear than my current laser pointer. The all-in-one USB/laser pointer design is also very useful. I am completely satisfied with this purchase. I wish I have bought this sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"It coudn't be easier","review":"I got one of these from a friend and was surprised by the size - the ones I had seen were big as DVD remotes.

This is a great camera that's capable of 1.3 megapixel and has a 2X digital zoom lens. The camera comes with 8MB of internal RAM which will store about 20 pictures at 1024x768. There is an expansion slot of additional memory and I picked up the SanDisk 32 MB card for that slot which stores about 100 pictures at 1024x768.In a nutshell, this is a really good starter Digital camera without a lot of frills.

My son turned that name into \\"Doppers\\" so that is now his name. I recommend this or ANY of the TY pluffies dogs. The ears are the softest. That's what my son rubs as he's going to bed at night. So sweet. I will be sad when he outgrows his best friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter Loves it!!!!!!!","review":"This puppy is so soft and cute. My daughter is obsessed with kipper the dog.

But it is the vocal melodies and, in some ways, the vocalist that doesn't do much for me.I remain objective, though. I'm not as adventurous as other progressive metal/rock fans are. I do like the fact that Reading Zero avoids technical over-the-topness and focuses on songwriting. If you are into the more unusual aspects of prog, you will probably like Reading Zero's The Actual. As a previous reviewer stated, comparable bands MIGHT be Rush, Metallica, Fates Warning and Queensryche. I would add Megadeth (the vocals) and Damn the Machine (the music & vocal melodies) to that list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book that should be left alone.","review":"A big downfall for this book is it takes so long before it has anything suspenseful. You can read the first half of the hole book and not want to read another page. It has no action scenes to speak witch would get your attention and give you some hope the book gets better. This truth to this is that it does not get better and there are no action scenes to be seen in the first half of the novel. There is some hope that there is some type of moral message or something that would educate you in this book but there is not. After your done reading this book it leaves you thinking \\"What was the meaning of this story\\". You may ponder that for a while then you will come up with a answer \\"What not to look for in a book\\". There is really no moral message to the story and you learn nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well for a small wine cellar","review":"I bought this to humidify my small (200 cu ft) wine cellar and it's working very well - lasts a week each fill and maintains humidity at a very stable level. It's great to have the accurate humidity controls (I checked them against a separate hygrometer and they're close). I agree with another reviewer - it stops and starts with little wheezes really annoyingly once it's achieved the target humidity. No problem shut up in my cellar, but it wouldn't be much fun in a bedroom. If they could sort this out it would get 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs!","review":"I received this as a gift and initially was very excited to use it. Several days of operation later and the night light went out. Two days after that, the Ionizer would not work. The next day, the entire control panel no longer functioned including the power button! I promptly returned and purchased a Bionare model which I hope will work out better. You certainly get what you paid for here, garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"correction to review","review":"This humidifier seems to have some kind of malfunction. It cuts off when an area between the base unit and the reservoir fills up with water. So far it as work for only an hour or two at a time before this happens. When it happens, you have to unplug the entire unit (which resets everything to defaults) and empty out of the water. Very messy and time consuming. After you empty the water, the humidifier will work for another hour or two before you have to repeat the process. I am very disappointed.It's been awhile since I wrote this review. At some point I decided to manipulate the float by hand and now the humidifier works fine. I think something might have been stuck. It is working and the air is much improved. I find I have to fill it twice a day--morning and before bed.

This last cold was the last straw, so I searched on amazon for a reasonably priced humidifier of reasonable quality. This one seemed to fit the bill.The fist night was fine, though I was concerned that the sensor never varied from reading a relative humidity of 61%. Even so, the unit humidified the room and my spouse commented that it seemed to help.The second night, my spouse said the unit had started emitting a high-pitched whine. I couldn't hear it, but that didn't matter.The person I bought the unit for was not satisfied, so I have decided to return the humidifier to amazon. I am replacing it with a highly rated humidifier from Lowe's. Hopefully I will have better luck with the new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a clean freak.","review":"It works perfectly fine, but it's impossible to clean in the tank. Literally impossible.

Not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"The first unit delivered was defective - did not work at all - and was replaced. The replacement works somewhat. It makes water vapor, but the hygrometer control is nearly useless. If you stick the sensor into the vapor plume, the humidity readout will rise until the unit shuts off as it should. Otherwise, it seems stuck on 20% even when another hygrometer, itself of questionable accuracy, reads more than 50%. I could have purchased locally a unit without a hygrometer for much less. So the unit is at best disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked one night","review":"Although this machine would be perfect with the bells & whistles, small footpring and the right price, it only worked one night.

When its working it performs well but I am having doubts about the quality control. I'm sure it's another quality Chinese product. Amazon has been terrific to deal with.#3 had a defect as well. The indicated room temp stayed at 32 degrees no matter what the actual room temp. I tried blowing warm air over the sensing unit but it stayed at 32.

These things are junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seemingly better than higher priced options.","review":"My wife and I moved to Illinois from South Florida in June. Since November I had really noticed how much drier it is in Illinois, especially at night with the heat on full blast. We purchased this humidifier and have been running it for about a week. It has been awesome. If you can deal with having to refill every night before bed, then you'll enjoy this piece of electronics. All dryness that I had to deal with at night before we got this is gone. It's pretty sweet. A night light that changes from green to blue is nice and relaxing. Not overwhelming unless you are a pitch black sleeper. It offers a bunch of settings, has an ionizer and allows you to adjust the humidity. I researched this pretty hard and it seemed like this would be the best bang for the buck and so far it is. For 43 bucks and free shipping you can't beat it. I'll do a follow-up in a few months, but so far so good.

Her behavior went back to normal the moment we turned the device off, and back to battiness the moment we turn it back on.I am giving it two stars because the device seems to be OK otherwise. And I'd still recommend it if you don't have a dog (or another pet with hearing in the ultrasound range).

Yes, there are the classics, but I would have further enjoyed the album if some other songs were a part of this compilation. Her song \\"Forever,\\" for example, would have been a good pick for this album. I also prefer the original \\"Fantasy\\" to the remix that's on the album. I hate to be critical of Mariah, because she is very talented, but she should have rethought this album's content."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"so-so\\"","review":"I like a few of Mariah's songs, so I took a chance and bought the CD. To be honest, I'm a bit disappointed...many of the songs sound a lot alike, there's not much variety. Yes, Mariah does have a great voice, but she should get some more original material to truly make use of her abilities. By far, the best track is \\"Hero\\", a great song! \\"Always be my baby\\" and \\"When you believe\\" are pretty good, too, but after that, I'm at a loss for examples. Bottom line, if you're a fan of Mariah, you'll love it, but otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it too highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greeting-card insipid","review":"The lyrics are way up there when it comes to the cringe factor...Mariah's voice is unimpressive anymore in an age of a similarly 7-octave endowed Celine Dion who benefits from a more passionate, more powerful, and more pristine voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S MARIAH, WHAT ELSE DO YOU WANT?!","review":"This album is tha bomb! I've always wanted to hear the Fantasy remix and it really kicks! It should go to number one, since it's already sold 6 million copies! MARIAH YOU'RE ON FIRE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's # 1's: A Must have CD for any fan of Diva Carey","review":"Despite Mariah's denials to the contrary, this IS a GREATEST HITS album. But that is nothing to be ashamed about, for this collection includes VISION of LOVE, SOMEDAY, LOVE TAKES TIME, and HERO amongst many. The new material includes Mariah's first duet with fellow diva Whitney Houston on IF YOU BELIEVE, from the soon to be released movie from Steven Spielberg, THE PRINCE OF EGYPT. Finally of note is Mariah's cover version of I STILL BELIEVE, originally released in 1982 by Brenda K. Starr, when Mariah served her apprenticeship as a 19 year old backup singer for Brenda, whose only major album is found in record store cut out bins. To Mariah's credit she makes this cover version her own, although I personally preferred Brenda's original. Overall, anyone who claims to be a Mariah fan should order this CD from AMAZON.COM right now. You can be assured you are paying the lowest current price for this sure to be triple platinum hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't we hear this stuff already- why would I buy it again","review":"when your popularity is falling fast , the next best thing is to rehash all the old songs that were hits. Nice try but I ain't falling for it. I don't want to hear old songs that I heard a million times already. I already have those old albums - in the attic somewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah is one fire","review":"I have never really like popular music until recently. She has more talent than other pop artists but sometimes she sticks to showing off less than an octave range on a song. I like the upbeat songs and ballads where she soars on the high notes. Being a singer myself I know noone that can sing that high. Probably an opera singer can but no other pop singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 million sales later-Mariah's #1's are a treat!","review":"I really love this singer. As soon as I heard \\"Fantasy\\" her voice convinced me to get all her cds and her material impressed me again & again. Her vocal gymnastics and the creativity she pushes into every song have made her #1 queen. I recommend this cd to anyone who is a non fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an Essential Collection, a must have!","review":"Mariah Carey surely has come a long way from her beginnings almost 10 years ago. This collection of #1 hits proves that her talent is unique, she is by far better than contemporary superstars Whitney and Celine because Mariah writes and produces her own music and she has a greater vocal range than them. This is such a great compilation that I can assure you that you've heard each song on the radio. My favorite is Hero, because it is a very inspirational song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah rocks, really?","review":"This album trully is ingenious--if you're still living back in 1991. Mariah has collected several catchy tunes... sadly though they all sound alike. These are Mariah's best for the nineties--and that's where they need to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah, on fire.","review":"Since the majority of these songs reached #1, this basically is a single disc \\"Greatest Hits\\". It's a great collection for the casual fan, and includes older hits like \\"Vision Of Love\\" and \\"Hero\\", and newer hits like \\"Honey\\" and \\"Sweetheart (with JD)\\". Plus she sings songs with \\"Brian McKnight\\" and \\"Whitney Houston\\". Too bad this couldn't include \\"Breakdown\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\", then it would really sound as good as she looks. Still though, with 17 great songs, it's hard to complain. If you need more \\"Mariah\\", check out her 2-CD \\"Greatest Hits\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL her 1's","review":"I really think Mariah instead of wanting to show off her 1's witch is okay! However this ones collection did not make it to number 1. stalled at #4 along with lead single I still believe also hit #4. Well were else can you go from number 1. The point is she should had waited to put all her hits together, its would sold alot more and look better. But its good work here . go miss carey....."},{"rating":"2","title":"10,000 STARS!","review":"This is a fantastic collection from one of the best voices of all time! You may not agree with what she wears but how could people dare to say this woman isn't talented? If you are a music fan,this is a must-have. It has such classics as Hero,Always Be My Baby,One Sweet Day,and one of my favorite songs which is Vision of Love(her first #1) If you want a CD that you don't have to skip tracks on GET THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb collection of songs","review":"Though I have been a fan Mariah's music for a little under half a year, I find that this is great album. The songs range from a more uptempo \\"Always Be My Baby\\" to a more soul inspiring \\"Hero\\", which is my favourite track on the album. The songs on this album just plain rock. If you are looking for a good selection of music, this album will not disapoint you in the least bit. It meets the needs of those who prefer lively and up-tempo songs while also pleasing those who enjoy slower and more heart moving songs. Most of all it is a good intro to Mariah's great musical talent. I highly suggest this album to anyone who is interested in starting a collection of Mariah's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal album!","review":"A truly classic collection from this phenomenal singer, with great songs and arrangements. I am continually in awe and admiration at what Mariah delivers on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"mariah carey along with this album is the best. she is very strong and has made it through all the terrible and untrue things people have said about her, since she was a little girl and taunted with racial comments. she has a magnificent voice and a gift for making all different kinds of music as shown in this album (slow beautiful ones, and fast hip hop ones). you need to get this cd. it's probably the only cd that has so many #1's on it- and its the price of buying only one #1 and having the rest that are just ok. and whats great is that you dont have to buy like 6 cds. these are all great songs, and she is a great person. and hey, if you had a body like that, you'd show it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the songs but they're not the best....","review":"I like the songs but they're not the best because I think her voice is gettin' kind of old. She has a good voice but the songs just aren't cuttin' anymore. I know \\"Honey\\" is supposed to be hip-hop but I think it sounds more like pop to me only with Puffy rapping on it. Maybe if she went back to the way she was before when she made pop songs she would be really good again. That's why I like some of her older songs like \\"Emotions\\" and \\"Dreamlover\\" and \\"Someday\\". \\"Sweetheart\\" has a good beat to it and I still consider \\"Honey\\" an okay song. I also love \\"Always Be My Baby\\" and \\"My All -Maria"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is wonderful yet I don't understand why they released it AND a greatest hits with 95% of the same material. ???","review":"These songs are golden, especially My All, Sweetheart, Whenever You Call, Honey, I Still Believe, Always Be My Baby, One Sweet Day, Hero, Fantasy, Vision of Love (2nd best), Dreamlover (favorite song ever), I'll Be There (3rd best song here) and Emotions.Mariah is in a category of Her own and I wish her new album will be worth a 4/5 star rating (at least) =^).Good Luck, Boo.Cover Art: A+ (Classifies a true Diva, unafraid of other's nasty opinions and rumors)Songwriting: B+Production: A-Length: A+Overall: A+~~Adrian~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great range of Mariah's hits!","review":"I bought this album when it first came out, and i only had the albums 'Butterfly' and 'Daydream', so for me this was a great album which inspired me to buy all of her earlier work. But if you already have all her albums you would probably find it a waste of money. There isn't anything really different apart from 'The theme from mahogany' which i think is only available on certain types. If you have all her albums only buy it if you're the kind of fanatic who would lose sleep over it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best CD in my collection.....","review":"I LOVE this CD! I got it for Christmas last year, and i still can't get it out of my CD player! I love all the songs! I never get bored while listening to this CD. My personal favorite songs are \\"Whenever You Call\\", \\"One Sweet Day\\", \\"Fantasy\\", \\"Honey\\", \\"My All\\", \\"Someday\\", and a lot more!

The new material on it is mediocre and I hate to say it Mariah, but Whitney Houston out does you on \\"When You Believe\\". I think that Mariah has become more interested in a movie career and wearing short dresses than she is with her music. And it is beginning to show."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is absolutely great!","review":"I have listened to this CD and I think it is really good. Mariah has done a good job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah Medley","review":"This is a good Mariah compilation. Solid mix of dance and R & B music, with pop attibutes at times and a little rap thrown in other times. Showcase of Mariah's stuff up to that time. Notable songs:Sweetheart - good bounce to it, an airy tuneHoney - fun and lively, good grooveFantasy - fun tune from mid-90s that makes the listener want to dance around. Good beat. Showcases Mariah's sopranoDreamloverEmotions - very good showcase of Mariah's vocal range and the power of her voice. Funky piano in there.Someday - Mariah's first \\"big one\\" from 1990 I think. Great tune, infectious pop with a hard edge. Mariah's powerful voice with its big range was already on display in her early 20s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someday","review":"the only thing that really bugs me about this album is that they didn't put the video version of \\"someday\\". instead the album version was put on \\"#1's\\". the video version has never been released on any of her albums or singles on anything else. they did release \\"someday\\" on the home video \\"the first vision\\" but it was an extended version. it's driving me nuts that you can't get it on a c.d."},{"rating":"2","title":"mariah rules!","review":"i am a really big fan of mariah!i really liked her songs and i think that she is worthy to be one of the divas.i also think that she's got the ultimate girl power!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection","review":"It's Mariah at her \\"best.\\" She said in her interviews that it's not a \\"best of,\\" but a commemoration of her number one hits, plus some new songs. With the exception of \\"Whenever You Call\\" with Brian McKnight, that song was on the \\"Butterfly\\" album when she sang it alone. You be the judge. The rest of the songs are familiar (and they should be) with \\"My All,\\" \\"Vision Of Love,\\" \\"Honey,\\" \\"Emotions,\\" and more. The song \\"When You Believe\\" from \\"The Prince Of Egypt\\" is to me the best cut on the CD. With Whitney Houston, it will be a superstar duet of the year. I'm glad that it won the Oscar for Best Original Song. All in all, a great collection of hits. In the future, she can do a \\"best of\\" CD with songs that people really like and not just have \\"#1's.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, she can sing, but not a singer","review":"Give her some credit she can sing. Diva, NOT! Just because she can sing, you cannot call her a diva. Just because she sold alot of records, that does not make you a diva. Classic, she is not. She is more hip-hop,r&b. Proving she is not a diva, look at the cover of her album. She is great for the young crowd to get up and dance. When you talk about divas, classics, look for Celine, Whitney, etc.. A little more experience and maybe she is ready to be called a diva. She need to get pass, Janet Jackson, Toni Braxton, Celine Dion, etc. One more thing Mariah, get over your body. Sleezy, is not considered a diva. Take some lessons from Celine and Whitney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"Jeez, you guys, this wasn't that much work for Mariah.

A couple million."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT! TRULY A MASTERPIECE!","review":"Surely the greatest singer alive!

A diva for the new millenium!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated and Out-dated","review":"Finally the world has come to realize that this woman isn't the great singer she appeared to be. Her songs sound like cheap Hallmark cards performed by a screeching cat that just got thrown into a tub of cold water. Her lyrics are typical to someone who is in 8th grade. Her music is watered-down and generic. She is more concerned with doing what it takes to make it on the charts at the moment than making good music that will stand the test of time. Her repeated use of guest rappers has gotten so tired and annoying that radio stations are refusing to play her anymore. Hopefully since she lost her last recording contract due to poor sales and her new album's a flop, maybe we won't have to hear too much more from her in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"she is singing like ape!","review":"I never be a fan of Mariah carey, I just bought this cd because my cousin wanted to have it,......never have interrest in her honesty.

It's impossible to find any non-vocal parts in any of her songs because she fills all interludes with screams and wails. I am so over her - she is more interested in showing off her legs than making good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not #1","review":"Mariah Carey does have reason for a hit's album. I mean she has had many hit singles. All singles in this CD are good, but by the way she sets it up its like listening to the same song over and over again. It would be better if Mariah mixed up the songs on #1's but instead you have to listen to the transition in her voice backwords. Definetly not #1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who signed Mariah Carey to a recording contract?","review":"Did anyone else besides me notice that she can't sing? Her voice is pure cacophony and agony for the ears. The songs are all about love and sound exactly alike. People go on and on about how Mariah writes her own songs...so what? They are absolutely awful! To be honest, I don't listen to much adult contemporary music, but Mariah's voice is untrained and off-key much of the time. She always feels the need to screech in a lot of her songs, which only makes it worse. I would highly recommend any Mariah Carey album...that is, if migraines and splitting headaches sound like fun to you. If you don't, then quit buying her albums so her record company drops her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah! You're on fire!","review":"A lot of her hits are on this album although certainly not all. Everything from her dance grooves to her well-known ballads and love songs with a little gospel mixed in. Mariah is known to have one of the best female voices in music history.

However, there seems to be a bit of change in her voice thru the years.. Listen to \\"Love Takes Time\\" and to \\"sweetheart\\", that would show us how Mariah knows to use many of vocal styles.

With the release of the album, #1's (why it's possessive, I don't know), her music becomes revived, a candle rekindled to remind everyone of the strong, robust female voice her body encases, not to mention the fact that she can sing in five octaves and hit a note that no normal human being can ever hit. (Okay, so Chihiro can do it, too, but it's not about her.)The album encases hits like Fantasy, Always Be My Baby, and Emotions. This is an album must have for any Mariah fan, no lie. Plus, this can act as a distant prelude to her latest album, E=MC<sup>2</sup>!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This compilation of her #1 songs is worthy...","review":"After almost a decade of performing to the world, it's about time to put out an album like this! One remark though, in \\"I Still Believe\\" (off her latest), her faint and cracking voice is highly noticeable even in her songs from the previous CD, Butterfly. It seems as if she's not taking care of her once-mighty voice. Also, at her concert this past year in Hawaii, she had to lip-synch a few of her songs (i.e., Emotions). It was evident that she could no longer hit those high-pitched notes that were heard in her earlier songs. What's happening, Mariah?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why should a person buy this cd?","review":"mariah, mariah what can i say to your fans? All I can say is skip this album unless you want to buy the same songs that you already own. The new songs on this album are a complete waste of engergy, time, and viewing power of the listener. Mariah did not put much time or effort into these songs and it clearly shows to everyone listening. Next time Mariah put more thought into an album before you release it and give your fans more to look forward to in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"very decent album, despite what the cover displays","review":"This album is good, although judging from the front picture alone, you would never guess. Her duet with Whitney Houston is striking, and \\"Whenever You Call\\" with Brian McKnight is equally beautiful. \\"I Still Believe\\" is one of my favorite songs on the CD, and the powerful lyrics are delivered well. Although her attitude and wardrobe need a little work, there is no denying her album is a goody. If you want extraordinary talent and less attitude, Whitney and Celine Dion are better choices, but Mariah Carey's voice and songs are more than satisfying.

To be fair, I loathe rival Whitney Houston's music and just about every other woman who can't write their own songs or play an instrument. I cannot stand it when women scream in what is meant to be a love song.

In the same vein as Streisand, Houston, Deion, etc. There's 50 girls at every high school that could sing this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"An affront to your ears and intellect.

The music is all over the place. There are so many different incarnations of Mariah here that it comes across like the roar of an unruly mob. The album lacks any sense of musical cohesion, making listening to it the equivalent of listening to a radio that keeps wandering from station to station as reception wavers and changes. There is some good material here, but her efforts to be \\"hip\\" and \\"street cool\\" are disasters. Mariah has talent, there is no argument there, she is even a thoughtful and generous person, but this compilation stinks. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Ho hum. Although there are a couple of cuts I appreciate, there are WAY too many hip hop numbers for my tastes. Have you ever heard her sing \\"Jesus, Oh What A Wonderful Child\\" from her Merry Christmas album? With that kind of voice and talent, why waste it on relatively \\"melodyless\\" hip hop? I don't dislike hip hop, but when I think of Mariah Carey, I think of sweeping vocals. The four included \\"bonus\\" tracks were no bonus. I would have preferred some of her #2 hits instead. If you love Mariah Carey, you'll excuse this album. However, if you REALLY love her voice, the \\"Merry Christmas\\" album is a far better choice (besides being inspirational)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks","review":"Although I didn't recognize a few of the songs on the album, I still thought it was great.

However, it does not hide the fact that she is quite possibly the most worthless popular entertainer today. She'd even give Cher a run for her money. The songs are glib, over-produced tripe. As Bill Hick's would have said, \\"ball-less, soul-less, spirit-less\\". Hellish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame commercial pop crap","review":"Here's the recipe for success: Wear tons of makeup, dress in skimpy outfits, come on to the president of Sony, have sex with him several times a day, and voila - you're an instant star! Of course Mariah Carey had to screw her way to the top, because she can't sing, she can't write, and all her songs sound exactly alike. The only thing there is to like about her is that she is living proof that there are ways to become successful in the entertainment industry while having no talent at all. Slap yourselves for buying either this or any other Mariah Carey album."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1's (1998)","review":"#1's is Mariah's 1998 album which features all her US #1 hits and a few bonuses.

She also has alot of good influence on younger kids i.e. camp mariah; her clothes could use some polishing up when in the midst of virgin eyes, because, she leaves nothing to the imagination, no mystery under the g-string outfits.

Also, her constant leaps into the upper reaches of the vocal stratosphere tend to get annoying. Less vocal gymnastics would defintely help many of these songs. And finally, what an annoying cover for the CD. Please, have some taste! My suggestion to Mariah going forward--how about trying to interpret other writers songs? Take a lesson from Linda Ronstadt, Mariah--listen to her \\"Cry like the rainstorm, howl like the wind\\" CD.

Everything is presented clearly and logically, and the case studies are relevant and interesting. I found it simple to read, informative, enlightening, and actually fun for the most part. My only criticism is that the authors don't, in my opinion, give an entirely neutral treatment of some of the politically-charged issues raised in their book.

It dedicates too much time to culture and history and far too little on basic Marketing, extrapolated to the global scene. For example, the product and market planning sections are very superficial(one chapter)and do not explain to the student (preferably through case studies, which I use)how exactly Marketing is carried out in the global setting. Also, there are chapters on products for consumers and business, and middlemen in distribution which my advanced students found boring. I now use Kotabe, which has a stronger orienation toward the practice of global Marketing rather than business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy, poorly organized, requires significant supplements","review":"I used this book in an MBA International Marketing course. The text is a very cumbersome read. While the book contains adequate anecdotal information, the information is poorly organized and often fails to engage the reader.

If you take out the 'f' word and all the other curse words, as well as the sexual scenes or innuendos, etc, you'd have about 10 minutes of film. I can't believe that someone actually wasted part of his/her life to write this film, and that people actually wanted to act in it. I certainly wasted 2 hours of my life watching it. I don't know why I just didn't turn the film off. But, I kept telling myself that surely it has to get better. Unfortunately, no. I gave it a '1' only because the site wouldn't let me put nothing. But, I give it a '0'."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies that we've seen","review":"This movie was really horrible, but thankfully we only rented it and did not purchase it. It was at a moment of weakness, when we couldn't find any other movies to rent. The acting was sub par and the characters did not even seem to be connected, especially the two main characters. I was especially disappointed in Kate Hudson, who seemed to play a great role in Fool's Gold. Her acting in this movie, however, left a lot to be desired.Besides bad acting, the movie was obscene in all the worst ways and not even funny. I suppose it could have been a decent movie if the acting was better and they added some comedy to it. Obviously, everyone has a different opinion. But if you prefer more intelligent movies, don't try this one :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible in every way!","review":"First off, I don't ususally watch this type of movie, but thought since Kate Hudson is in it and Alec Baldwin it might be a little funny and I was bored one Sunday and decided to waste some time. Well a waste of time was all it was! It was disgusting and even the story line was stupid. Jason Biggs makes me want to throw up (even though the ONLY part in the whole movie turns out to come from his character getting his eyebrows shaved off). Other than that I have lost all respect for Kate Hudson (even though I know Fool's Gold was pathetic) and Alec Baldwin for even being in this movie. Also Dane Cook is a terrible actor and really the only redeeming thing he's ever been in is Dan in Real Life. Overall this deserves no stars, but since you have to give it at least one I did.

I can't imagine how they cleaned it up for basic cable because this movie is so crude, filled with obscenity and laced with ugly sex jokes (the male lead actually goes pants down in front of the face of his prospective mother-in-law). The F-word appears multiple times in just about every sentence and the c-word crops up gratuitously every few minutes. The plot premise is clever, but the development is so over the top that it is absurd. There is nothing that motivates the major romance, either.The only reason I watched this to the end was to see if it ever pulled back from drilling down to the lowest common denominator.

But if you care about women, don't ever buy it. Although it had the classic romantic ending, the rest of the movie with the swearing, the vulgarness, the written words on the punks T-shirt to emphasize his vulgarness, will not go over well with a lady. The middle of the movie toned that down, but then 20+ minutes toward the end kicked it right back into high gear. I will be giving my copy to Goodwill. It is not a keeper. And I like Kate Hudson.

I have tried to give Dane Cook a chance, and he just doesn't do it for me. Besides His role in Dan in Real life, his acting is rather unbeliveable and he often looks as though he is just trying too hard. And Kate Hudson, well, she is the same person in every movie, very one dimiensional. I would like to say this would be a good movie for a snowy day, but it wasn't.

The writing is okay, the typos are abundant, and the \\"flow\\" is minimal. The book ends horribly - totally disjunct.Sgt. Camsell is P.O.'d by the SAS, that's for damned sure as mustard, and reading his insight was interesting, although maybe not entirely gospel truth, but the rest of the book is dull, anticlimactic, irrelevant. Either Sgt. Camsell is not a good story teller, or he had a sucky editor (if one at all). or the M.O.D. removed all the juicy parts and left him the tales of routine to publish.Don't get me wrong - I have ENORMOUS respect for the members of SBS, but this book stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Eye-Opener","review":"Very little is known about the SBS and this book does a lot of illuminating.

The lack of true alt-pop/ alt-rock that Ben Folds is known for makes this album a must have for all who need everything that has Ben's name on the label, but if you want to listen to the piano solos and harmonizing that I love BFF for this is not a wise purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's hope the next effort is a better one","review":"I'm sorry, Ben Folds, but ditching Darren Jessee and Robert Sledge was a poor choice. After four incredible and incisive albums, BFF should have taken a well-deserved break and regrouped for a fifth killer album. Instead, we have Ben leaving the continent to pursue domestic bliss and recording this mess of kitsch, keyboards and noise. Not to say that these are bad ingredients, but that here they're formless and the ideas are undercooked. What made BFF a great act was the synthesis of wit, talent and musicianship. What makes this album a disappointment is the lack of focus, polish and practice. Ben Folds is a ridiculously talented musician, but not necessarily one who has mastered instruments beyond the piano. I hope he gets a chance to work with the trio again, some time in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q tip?","review":"I turned it on and quite literally, scratched my head. I really don't mean to be rude, but this album is truly awful. This isn't coming from some light-hearted, musicless, Ben Folds rookie. I own all of his albums and actually listen to and enjoy all of them but this one is a rarity in the bunch. It just doesn't make any sense. I do listen to other things that some might call \\"musical obscurities\\" but this doesn't even qualify as that. You guys, it's really bad. Sorry Ben, the rest of your stuff is fantastic but this is something that really should be ignored.By the way, William Shatner does nothing more than recite a cliche poem so don't purchase this simply for that reason. Or any reason for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH. Avoid this album.","review":"I am one of the biggest Ben Folds fans you will ever find. I can't get enough of his music. And so I decided to buy this CD, the last one of his that I do not have in my collection. WHAT A MISTAKE. This CD is immediately making its way to the trash can, it's not even worth my time to sell it... This CD is NOT the Ben Folds music you have come to love over the years. This CD is comprised of ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC and SPOKEN WORD PIECES (not all spoken by Ben Folds). I don't even think Ben Folds' singing voice shows up once on this entire album, let alone any REAL songs. [...] Avoid this CD if you're a Ben Folds fan. This CD is for electronica/dance lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben Folds meets Fat Boy Slim","review":"This CD is a big change from the Ben Folds Five CDs we all know and love, highlighting the talents of Folds in a different light. Rhythmic bass and drum loops, a small touch of piano, and well placed vocal harmonies yield extremely catchy tunes. Only a few of the songs follow a traditional verse-refrain pattern. The rest resemble a Fat Boy Slim style with drum and bass loops carrying the song intermixed with sampled vocals and other instruments. The ending result is a great collection of easy-to-get into, fun songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What- I can't give this a ZERO???","review":"I like Ben Folds Five- and this album was advertised as half pop/half comedy. I thought about buying it and should have taken a hint of the quality of this CD when it was being sold NEW at a store for 2.98 a month after it's release. I sold it back to the store after a week for a quarter- this just might be the worst album ever made- their are no catchy tunes- they almost aren't any tunes whatsoever- and it's not funny- just pointless- I'd rather watch paint dry for 45 minutes than listen to this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away - Far Away","review":"What a mess. How Ben Folds convinced a record company to release this ridiculous piece of \\"music\\" is beyond me. Did they even bother to listen? Painful. Don't fall for the \\"if you're a true fan of BFF, you've got to have this disc.\\" I love everything I've heard from BFF (including Naked Baby Photos with its off-the-cuff studio ramblings), and I just about [lost it] when I heard Fear of Pop. Let's just hope \\"Volume 1\\" doesn't imply future volumes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help! Can't Get It Out Of My CD Player!","review":"Tremendous work, proving Ben Folds' genius at putting together music that just sounds wonderful. From the Seventies grit-groove of \\"Kops\\", to the darkly ascerbic \\"In Love\\", to beautiful harmonies in \\"Slow Jam '98\\" and \\"Avery M. Powers Memorial Beltway\\", to the song I can't get out of my head, \\"I Paid My Money\\".Buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's different...","review":"But shear brilliance.All you people who are giving it 1 star are just ignorant. Open your ears, think outside the box. It proves that Ben is an amazingly talented guy. Just because it doesn't sound like any of his other stuff doesn't mean it isn't any good. And if you must listen to old BFF songs, and thats why you throw away \\"Fear of Pop\\", then listen to Rubber Sled. They play Brick in the background. Smile.This CD is true bliss. It really is. It's really different than his past projects, but it is damn good.This CD is amazing. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was atypical of his earlier work but it was amazing.....","review":"This Album is a very very good blend of many musical styles of the genius music pop writer Ben Folds. He strays from his original style that brought him a loyal fan base and critical acclaim but even on a few tracks he has to return his blissful pop melodies. This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Ben Folds, lose Shatner","review":"I must say that this is a very \\"different\\" album with Shatner singing. I love Ben Folds and was willing to take a chance with Shatner being on this. (I had hoped he might be in the background banging a spoon on a glass or something rather than signing.) The song \\"In Love\\" has great music and vocals by Ben, but Shatner ruins it. I wish there was a version I could by that didn't have him in it because it really is a good song.Matt Zarnstorff"},{"rating":"2","title":"funk, and jam","review":"Can we say Funk, well thats the word that comes to mind when i first heard \\"Kops\\"(track 2). this track is action packed with a 70's karma, cop chasing, superfly, bell bottom, afro sporting excitment. the ability to create a great track that can capture all these images is hard to do, this album contains great creativity and not to mention a beautiful title, if u like complicated funky sounds, this is a must to have! Adios Kops!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strange Departure for Ben Folds After the split with the 5.","review":"Well i am a HUGE fan of Bens and have loved everthing he has done, but this one is a little out there.While i didn't hate it, i know i wont be listning to it over and over again, but it will get a few listens.But if your a Ben Folds Fan you have to at least check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"brillaint!!","review":"For those who are totally into Ben Folds for his paino ballads (which I love) and closed down to anything resembling drum and bass or 70's funk...don't bother. For the rest of us, this album is supremely funky and witty as hell. Shatners vocal turn is, as usual, great fun. Plus it shows why Ben folds is far more than just a singer/songwriter. I wish this cd would reach a wider audience. people will be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but cool.","review":"You can definately tell that Fear of Pop is the work of Ben Folds - I think the CD is just plain awesome. There's never a dull moment, and I absolutely love \\"In Love\\" with William Shatner \\"singing\\". :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that impressed","review":"I really wanted to like this product but after two weeks, I'm tossing it. It does a great job at keeping liquids cold which was the main selling point for us. However, it leaks way too much! This is the leakiest sippy cup we've ever owned. Another con is that the fluids get stuck around the bottom of the mouthpiece. Not a huge deal if you have water in the cup, but when you have milk, it gets gross after a few hours. There needs to be a tighter fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, but Not Functional","review":"Also have found this sippy fairly non-functional. Unless you get the sippy portion in just right and tighten it extrememly tight, it leaks. So far, we've only been able to use for H2O due to leakage. Does keep stuff cold, but for only 7 oz, does it really matter? It's empty within a few sips. Also an issue is it's weight. My toddler has a bad habit of throwing his sippy's in the car, so with this cup, we've got a dangerous flying projectile. Too bad, b/c we love the concept of a non-plastic thermos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish, but what good is that with a leaky sippy?","review":"Ok, so the Thermos part of this is cool, and it looks cool. It's nice to be able to keep milk chilled for 5-6 hours.Other than that, this sippy isn't practical. Why, because it leaks and is difficult to clean. Yes, all sippy cups do leak to some degree, but this one is one of the worst that I've experienced (I own 6 different brands). Also, it has no lid or travel sealing disc. So there's no way you can put this in your diaper bag. It's only good around the house if you follow your child around.This is on the back of the shelf and only gets used when all the other cups are dirty. Don't waist your money. Get an Avent sippy cup instead, they work great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be lost without this","review":"I love this cup and also own several of the Thermos Foogo products. I travel a lot and rely on this to keep the milk cold, and it does. It does dent when dropped on a hard surface, but overall has held up well."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPER Leaky...","review":"I was excited about this product until I realized that the thing leaks not only from the spout, but the sides of the screw-on top as well. Once the purple top spout is removed for cleaning, you can forget it - it doesn't snap back into the pink top and it leaks everywhere. It's almost as if it's not supposed to come out, although it must. It didn't leak the first week because I didn't realize that the purple spout was a separate piece. I'm definitely bummed, as they aren't cheap and I bought three. I'll use them when she gets a little older and isn't prone to flinging the cup across the room. BTW, I just received the Kleen Kanteen 12-oz. sippy in the mail. After testing it right away, it leaks from the spout too, although not nearly as bad. Don't use it on your carpeted areas, parents!"},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks!!","review":"I was so excited to get these cups, but the leak like crazy. There are 5 parts to the cup: the cup, the lid, the spout and 2 pieces to the leak proof valve... what a pain! It would be worth it though, if it didn't leak, which it does. I would not recommend this cup, in fact mine are in the goodwill bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better","review":"There are 4 dvd's in this set I unfortunately own 2 of them Volume 1 and Volume 2. The price is nice considering you do get 8 episodes per disc. Thats about the only good thing I can say. The quality is horrible. The bonus feature has got to be somebodies idea of a joke. And none of the episodes contain the original theme song.

The tons of content kept him watching the DVD a couple of night a week for the past month, and the addition of Jordan's best games to this edition of the DVD set made him really happy.

If you're a fan, get this one quickly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A flawed album......","review":"The other reviews say it all. Well, almost all. I would add that there are some flaws in this album. First, I don't know where they came up with Ricestrow for the name of a tune. It is Rye Straw, or Dog in the Rye Straw, or (well, you will have to do a search to learn more, because if I give the full title my post will be deleted). Second is that Michael's chop is sometimes slightly behind the beat. Just slightly, but still annoying. But the big flaw is the moron who is stomping his feet, and who gets so far off beat that he has to start over. And does. Why we tolerate such fools is beyond me. Right up there with people who bring screaming infants to nice restaruants. Isn't that why we have McDonalds?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely agree - useless","review":"I completely agree with the previous reviewer. This dictionary is useless, and yes, like all Hippocrene dictionaries it is a cheap reprint of an earlier edition. The comments on the dictionary are spot on - and the explanatory approach in lieu of a translation reflects a habit common in cheap Indian dictionaries (there are examples of Bengali and Oriya dictionaries just as bad - but I hasten to add that there are some excellent Indian dictionaries as well). The real pity is that as far as I am aware there is no good modern dictionary either Tamil-English or English-Tamil and surprisingly for such a major language, very few serious textbooks either. This dictionary can do nothing other than further frustrate learners and does nothing to serve the needs of more advanced scholars."},{"rating":"2","title":"lawd have mercy he did it again","review":"some major label needs to sign josephine johnny cause he still fiya on this one.aint the greatest on lyrics but can make a club rock. double j still hot off the heater ya heard. he aint got to beef with choppa cause he on his way to YA HEARD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather not write a review","review":"I thought I was rating the seller.

It is so full of infectious energy and rhythm that you can't help but fill your head with happy thoughts. First there is the timeless \\"New Day For You\\", then the irresistable \\"Waters of March\\" (you'll play it again and again) after that the downright cool \\"Astrud\\" and finally the uplifting \\"Angels Blush.\\" Music is supposed to be a passageway to the soul and this album helps you find it.

In my life, I have never come across anyone who recycled so many songs from album to album. Can anyone attribute more than 15 or 20 different songs to this lady? Honestly! NEVERTHELESS, Basia is MUST-HAVE music, and I'm a fan. Just do your due diligence and buy only ONE CD.

I love the very short stories in this book. I loved reading them in between the less short stories. They feel very unlabored and they work. I love how the stories tell the funny little things that happen inside peoples' heads while they're connecting or disconnecting with someone or someplace, or the idea of someone or someplace. How physically intimate people can be and yet make no real connection at all. Being deprived of what you are used to, and trying to get used to the way things have or have not become. Many, though not all of the stories deal with life's disappointments, and at the same time they are infused with a reassuring sense of humor that makes them a pleasure to read. I savored every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"neat to have","review":"This is fun to have in your collection but with regards to performance this wasn't the greatest of brass playing.

The point of swaddling is to wrap the arms,and this blanket just doesn't wrap tight enough for that. At three months old she's 17 lbs and can still get out of it fairly easily. You can forget about tucking the legs into that cute little pocket inside, then the baby just stretches her legs out and, voila! no more swaddling blanket.

Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffocating","review":"Every child is different but my daughter hated this.

I want more but am waiting for another sale.The only problem is the hair and their heads. Their hair is a wig that is barely attached,like barely glued on, so dont let your little kids play with these dolls or they will most definetly rip off their wigs. Their heads are also going to be easily ripped off with kids. The head isnt sewed on to the body it is kind of loose and rotates around a bit. If I let my kids hold them I am right there watching them like a hawk. My kids kissed the dolls and tucked them into bed and said night night!I actually went on Kohls and got this doll for 30% off using their code and got it for $35 with tax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Naughty Fun","review":"Spicy and hilarious are two words I use when I describe this book to my friends. I picked it up as an impulse buy and was not disappointed. The story of this real woman and her completely messed-up personal life (an OCD mother and a hypochondriac husband, not to mention her quirky friend...) grabs you as a reader and makes you want more. This is the reason it loses a star, I wanted more at the end. The rest of the book was so great that the end was anticlimactic (I'm not giving anything away, don't worry). It was wonderful to see a strong woman in the driver's seat, both sexually and in the day-to-day. Margolis goes into heart-racing detail that will make you forget where you are because you just want to see what's next. \\"Neurotica\\" is definitely a book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funnny, but very thin, and ultimately stupid","review":"I laughed out loud multiple times reading this book, which is why it took a while for me to realize that \\"funny lines do not a good book make.\\" The plot is far fetched, the characters are superficial, the \\"erotica\\" is crass and amateurish, and the ending is absurd.

But really--dumb, dumb, dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"after reading SISTERIA, this was a bore","review":"I read Sue Margolis' second novel, sisteria months back before I grabbed a copy of neurotica and well, I was sorely disappointed.

I think the main reason for this is that I found the characters to be unlikable and too over the top; I just never really related to Anna and Dan, both of whom I found to be whiney and annoying. Also, Margolis over-uses metaphors to the point of ridiculousness--a good example is the \\"wooly mamouth\\" quote in the editorial review above. I think that this is supposed to be raunchy British wit, but I just found it to be stupid and not at all funny, unlike the other British books I've read. Perhaps fans of Benny Hill-type humor will enjoy this one, but it just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amusing disappointment","review":"This book is a bit on the absurd side, which I like, but it left me wanting more.

This seems like the perfect assignment for Anna who decides to do a little hands on research after years of having her husband Dan, who is a hypochondriac, refusing to have sex with her for fear that he may have a heart attack. Anna's exploits are so funny that they will have you laughing out loud but even funnier is Dan's fear of...well everything from testicular cancer to spontaneous human combustion. These two paired with Anna's mother who is being stalked by a fellow obsessive compulsive group member and Anna's best friend Brenda who is by Anna's side through it all while getting into a little trouble of her own makes for a very amusing read.I haven't read a whole lot of British humor but after reading Neurotica I will definitely be reading much, much more. If you want an easy and entertaining read this is the book for you! 4 Stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"But, wait, she gets better","review":"I did not like this book at all. I bought it because this author wrote another book called \\"Spin Cycle\\" I LOVED \\"Spin Cycle.\\" It was great, so I thought I'd like this too. It just wasn't what I expected.But \\"Spin Cycle\\" was her second book, so the author is improving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Ridiculous","review":"Both boring and ridiculous, didn't find this book worth the short time it took to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff -- and not even GOOD fluff","review":"When the ecstatic blurb on the cover is from People Magazine, that should be a tip-off!

A fast-pace tale exploring the perils and raptures in the pursuit of passon.A Contemporary Romance that redefines the lusty woman's search for erotic satisfaction.\\"Neurotica,\\" a fun and entertaining read that was quick and easy on the eyes. A story I enjoyed immensely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great overall","review":"This book is only 'okay'. I don't think Sue Margolis is a real person. There is no author info or photo on the book, so this is probably written by a couple of people. Overall, it's lame, but there are a couple of choice sections. There are too many other good books floating around to bother wasting your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Too many extra characters with no purpose to the story. The tone and the the occasional wit don't make up for a story that isn't finessed to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly disappointing","review":"Don't waste your time reading this book. It provided absolutely zero entertainment. It really wasn't that funny at all. Sue Margolis tried to be creative with her story, but it ended up being cheesy, predictable, and too far fetched to be enjoyable. Her characters had no depth, and she actually brought too many different characters into the story. Her storyline was all over the place with a slew of players, almost all of them insignificant, and it only made things confusing. It left me wondering what the whole point of the book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved Spin Cycle by Sue Margolis so I went out and got Neurotica right away. I could not have been more disappointed by this book. I thought it was totally tasteless, crass and unrealistic to name a few things. I usually really like these types of books (British Humor), but this one was truly awful. It was like I was reading a book by a totally different author than Spin Cycle, I couldn't believe it. I'd advise anyone to steer clear of this one, but that's just my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Erotica..........","review":"well, it took me so long to get into this book that i had to start it over a few times to remind me what it was that i read. i finally sat down to finish it, but it seemed to drag for me. the characters seemed weird and superficial.i found anna's infidelities quite disturbing. it was very upsetting, since dan was trying desperately to deal with his own neuroses and idiosyncrasies to make the marriage work.i was, however, happy with the ending and the television show anna ended up on. there were a few cute one liners which made me smile.as far as anna's mother, it just didn't work for me. i found her character to be boring and contrite.all-in-all, this was a pretty blah book and i am glad that it is over."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've forgotten how to laugh, don't read this book","review":"This is one of the best examples of british humor I have seen in quite some time. Most americans just don't understand british humor and that is because it's brutally honest. The characters may not do exactly what you would do, but they do what you would WANT to do. I laughed out loud so many times in this book, I can't count them all. For those of you who follow Absolutely Fabulous, the characters in this book walked right off their set. Truly hilarious, honest and an example of what many relationships are really about. Leave your pretense aside, and have fun for once. Read this book, it might just give you that spark you need again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly funny!","review":"I found this book to be wickedly funny and raunchy as hell. It's well written and the characters come alive for the reader. The sexual liason scenes are hysterical. Not for the prudish or those who are easily offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"World Cultures\\" more of a world history","review":"I teach 7th grade world cultures and was given this book as my classroom text. I found the text to be very informative but the title is very misleading. Rather than a classroom text on world cultures it was more of a in depth analysis of world history. It failed to include everyday cultural activities such as clothing, habits, beliefs (outside of religion) and everyday life. Too much of each chapter was focused on ancient history without connecting the culture to the modern world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe that you are getting 20 books.","review":"Although the announcement makes you think that maybe yo will be getting 20 books for a song, you will be singing a different tune when it arrives.

Not even good enough for a grade schooler.","review":"I had high hopes for this book, which promises to show you how to use color and other design principles to make more effective presentation slides.But the slide examples are terrible! Yellow text on a purple background? Cheesy clip art? These all look like BEFORE slides from the 1990's. No professional would ever present slides that look this bad. Look at the book's cover. That's the most attractive visual you'll find in this entire book.Even my grade school daughter looked at the pages and recoiled in horror, crying \\"Are these supposed to be GOOD slides?\\". Can you imagine the impression these slides would leave with executives and prospective clients?There are a few useful tips but they are buried in so many bad slide examples I cannot bear to give this book more than 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Training Advice","review":"This DVD provides a good visual introduction to the concepts introduce in the book Stretch to Win. Subtle aspects of the stretching method are much easier to pick up via video. Well worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing.","review":"I bought the book Stretch to Win first and then bought the video in hopes that the video would fill in the gaps in the book. It does not. The video doesn't offer any new information. The gap is that the book is supposed to give you the keys to developing your own sport specific program. There is a section in the book that details what different sports need in terms of types of stretches. There is another section that lists stretches, but there is no section that explains what stretches belong to what categories.The DVD just shows the \\"sample\\" stretch routines being done. There is a football player, a baseball player and a golfer showing stretches that they do. And a girl who demonstrates some specific stretches. The DVD is touted as giving you the ability to print off workouts. This is just a PDF file that again just replicates sections out of the book. I would strongly encourage others to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"They couldn't supply the video. If you're lucky, they will refund you.

CDs usually are good gifts for anyone, but I always like to go off the beaten path a bit and find ones no one else has heard of. Being someone who was a voice major in college, I check out the classical stuff every so often - and came across this CD. It's definitely a 'beginner' disc for classical music folk, but the cool thing was for NYC-ers like myself it's awesome to entertain with. I actually tried the Zucchini Cups recipe on another disc (bought 3 of the 4) and the recipe is surprisingly delicious.Even if someone doesn't use 'em during an ACTUAL dinner, it seemed like a good and different (thank heavens for different!) bargain for music, learning how to prepare a good meal, and wine lessons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I liked this CD because of the fact it isn't the same old Mozart war horses one would expect.

Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd...","review":"Ordered two of these, sent me the wrong battery clips and didn't send it through postage properly, had to pay the mailman when it came (which ironically, the postage ended up being more than the clips themselves) maybe just a fluke, but I was not impressed with the service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Clip","review":"What's to say? The Battery Clip was just as I expected and worked like a charm. Kind of hard to mess up on this one, wouldn't you say? Got it on time and had my 12 Volt Battery pack for my portable radio/mp3 player put together with good quality rechargeable batteries (not like it came with) and going within a short time. The replacement battery pack was no longer available (I bought the radio/player elswhere-not Amazon) and put my own together with the parts I bought from Amazon. It took a little \\"modifying\\" of the receptacle on the radio/player also. A little tricky, but worth it. Something a person has to 'just know' how to do and have all the tools. Anyway, the battery clip, and battery holder, and quality rechargeable batteries from Amazon worked out great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a battery clip.","review":"I bought this along with a breadboard starter kit. It works exactly as one would expect, but keep in mind that the wires are thin and may be difficult to insert into some breadboards, as they may simply bend rather than insert.

Not if you really hope to understand and master the language, and possibly have a vague idea of how to use it. Not with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review. Quick. Perfect Condition.","review":"The book is intended for Advanced Grammar classes.

The book was in perfect condition when it arrived.

The only thing I can say is that I disagree wholeheartedly. Easily the most unfocused songwriting-wise, teetering on the edge between raw and intellectual (like pre-1976 BOC) and polished (like Mirrors and Agents of Fortune), Cultosaurus Erectus is just not a very exciting listen, the only moment of energy coming with the lyrically dumb but at least lively \\"The Marshall Plan\\". The rest is mostly an uneasy marriage of keyboard and guitar, plus a lot of \\"strangeness for strangeness' sake\\". I expected much more from the album that sits squarely between the positive, bright sheen of 1979's Mirrors and the soaring, hook-filled pop-metal of 1981's Fire of Unknown Origin. Don't make this your first Blue Oyster Cult album -- it'll give you a false, fickle impression of this brilliant, if erratic band. Best for BOC fans who want a complete picture of the band's output."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best B-C CD out there","review":"Their best CD in my opinion, there are 9 tracks which flow nicely into one another and are just exceptionally well done. The best songs are included on this CD, including Black Blade, Unknown Tongue, and Fallen Angel. The CD tops the others in the choice of the tracks chosen. Overall, the best CD by Blue Öyster Cult."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rocksolid album","review":"tagged \\"Heavy Metal\\" or Hard Rock\\" is not always a recommendation, in every sense. This 1980 B.Ö.C. album is neither, released after \\"Mirrors\\" which adopted a softer style. Powerpop describes this band more, but on stage it is somewhat different the matter. This album is more guitar orientated and therefore sounds heavier, although there are keyboards present on several songs. The opener \\"Black Blade\\" is an eerie tale, with strange soundeffects, co-written with SF author Michael Moorcock. A solid rocksong. The next \\"Monsters\\" starts in the same vein but is interrupted by a jazzy part, complete with saxophone, which is repeated a few times but climaxes in the rockmode. This goes for the other songmaterial, more leaning towards hard rock but recognisable as B.Ö.C. songs. All in all a good album, which hasn't lost any of its impact almost 3 decades earlier. I still find pleasure in listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Black Blade starts this album out in menacing fashion. This is one of my favorite BOC albums. This album rocks harder than some of their previous records. I just pulled this out the other day and it really has stood the test of time.

Everything in between these songs is amazing as well. I stronglyn recommend this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Love Me Tonight (1932)","review":"This is one of Jeanette's early musicals with Maurice. It's filled with humor, wit, and quaint songs that you will recall and remember. The photography is amazingly creative throughout. The plot, typical of early musicals, is somewhat mindless, but the acting and singing make up for any deficits. Wonderful entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeanette MacDonald was great","review":"This was NOT a great musical. It was fun to see all these people when they were young,as I only remember them older here in the states. Maurice was his usual 'speak sing' and Jeanette was learning but great voice. This would not fit the title of 'musical' as we know them today."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mini-series picks up!","review":"I was worried about what the ten-book mini-series was going to be like after reading no 45, which wasn't half as good as I expected it to be. But this book was a huge improvement. There was a lot of fighting, but somehow it seemed to return to the quality of the old Animorph books, even though it was short. Ax's previous books have made me dislike him slightly; he seemed more and more arrogant. This book has changed my mind about him, showing why he has always been so careful before to not interfere in human matters, and the terrible choice he had to make. The ending was brillant and echoed parts of the Hork-Bajir Chronicles, especially. The book didn't change so much from the-war-with-the-Yeeks point of view, but it changed Ax's friendship with the Animorphs completely. One of the best Ax books recently!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"For a story arc book which promised lots of cool stuff, well, so far, changes have happened in the awesome #45 The Revelation, The Ellimist Chronicles, and #47 The Resistance (which is the latest book;it's really good.)The Deception was horrible,and had no point.I think the reader below this one is 100% right.Nothing happened...nothing!

Also the book is divided into unlogical sections, so you'll never find the info you are looking for unless you remember where it was mentioned. We bought it because there was also a short part about Whistler. That was also not that informative, nothing about the slopes or skiing. The book gives you basic details (except I could not find Vancouvers population) in a bit confusing manner, but nothing extra. It also has no pictures, what makes it a bit uninteresting.

They only offered a corrected copy when it would be printed. I've never received one, and, these incorrect texts are on the shelves in book stores worldwide.Look at pages 205, 208 and 215 for some incorrect words.Once again, no matter the good and great things in this book, you will learn an embarrassing Czech that does not exist if you use this book.

The book is so touching and so sweet and wonderful.However, I was deeply disappointed when I watched the movie. The movie is so loosely based on the the book, it's like watching a different story. The movie changed names, Marty's first husband was Clem and she named their son Claridge, which was her maiden name; \\"Sarah\\" Graham wasn't named in the book, she went by \\"Ma\\" and Missie was only 1, not 8, just to name a few facts they missed. I was also disturbed by the fact that they put in a few bad words and a scene that isn't clean or nice. The book is very clean.Overall, the story is pretty good, although not very much like the book.

The book is 50 times better than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"I recently read \\"Love Come Softly\\" and decided to check out the hallmark movie edition. What a disappointment. This is not Clark and Marty Davis from the book. Instead we have pouty-lipped straggly-haired actress playing the part of Marty- and a hefty middle-aged guy playing Clark. Sorry, Clark and Marty are both young- and Clark was NEVER fat. Nor that old. Missy was very young not a pre-teen, and Marty's husband was named Clem not Aaron.Many of the changes made to the screenplay were senseless and added nothing to the plot. (Such as the name switch).

(She and Clark don't share a room.) Marty has a lot of learning to do--she hasn't had to work hard until now. She also has a few things to teach resistant Missie.This is a good family movie! It is not like the book in every aspect, such as Missie's age, but overall it stays quite true to the book. There are many emotional moments and a few funny moments in this film.

It would have been nice to have more of the characters included in the movie and more of the thoughts of the main character. The actors in the movie gave the story more depth into the characters emotions. I hope to see more movies like this one.

It has a tragic beginning & portrays the drama and the mourning that comes from such a tragedy. It has the struggle of and challenges of the new relationships that are born out of the situation. There is drama, depth and humor in the journey to develop a relationship with the little girl 'Missy'. I really enjoyed a romantic story that had so much in the story between the young girl Missy and the main character. By the end of the story it is difficult not to fall in love with the characters. In one scene Marty (the main character) spends a good part of the day preparing a chicken dinner - in this I really appreciated the realisitc look at the life of these pioneers. This is a story with depth that is so wonderful as you allow yourself to identify with the characters in the day they live and the situations they found themselves in. This is up amoung my all time favorites!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ,clean hallmark movie!","review":"I have read Janette Oke's book Love Comes Softly, but i didn't like it as much as the movie.

I would love to find more movies of this caliber!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A father's unconditional love","review":"Love Comes Softly is a simply told story of love on many levels. It is sweetly romantic but offers real moral depth. It is mostly content to show rather than tell -- a strength in movies. The director understands a metaphor. The telling that does occur, works in context. The central exposition is well-placed and is as well and simply stated an explanation of why bad things happen to good people as I've heard. I found the lead actors engaging and attractive. Katherine Heigl as Marty and Dale Midkiff as Clark are convincing in their tragedies and joys. The Western frontier setting strips away the distractions of modern life but reveals the core of humanity that is no different today than one hundred or even two thousand years ago. While the outcome is predictable, it is because human nature is consistent. If you want to experience emotion vicariously, and risk some tears and some laughter, Love Comes Softly is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Comes Softly is Excellent","review":"An excellent movie reminiscent of Little House on the Prarie.

However, I must say I was very dissapointed with the movie, for while the movie itself is very good, it strays dramatically from the author's original writing of the book, \\"Love Comes Softly.\\" I felt that as a Christian-based book, the movie should have followed suit.

They ruined the story! Missie was portrayed as 8 instead of 1 (and a tomboy, when Missie turned out to be very feminine), Marty seemed a lot less like her character in the book, Ma Graham is not in the movie as much as she should be, and they felt the need to add dramatic things to the story, which really weren't necessary. The lost note from Marty to Clark, Clark walking in on Marty in the bath, Marty having her baby delivered by Clark instead of Ma Graham... just stupid annoying things like that. I couldn't even get myself through the other movies. The second one opens up with some dramatic scene... blah. Read the books! =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clichés, clichés and more chlichés","review":"I seem to be in the minority here, but I found this movie very overrated. The story is standard romance formula 1A, with some discussions about faith thrown in to please Christian viewers. It's extremely predictable and never feels authentic. The movie has nothing to offer that we haven't seen a hundred times before. I don't think I've seen a movie with so many clichés since \\"Blonde Ambition\\".The acting is also weak, and having also seen \\"The Last Sin Eater\\", which also had very bad performances, even by talented actors, I'm starting to suspect Michael Landon doesn't know how to get good performances out of his cast.Recommended only for die-hard fans of sappy made-for-TV dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not even twenty one!?","review":"If talent gets any younger most of the bands today will be out of a job.

It is also a great history book. It also offers up a nice slice of history in America and some of the world during Bob Hope's lifetime. The 1920s and 1930s are described as being like a completely different country: regional and national acts seemed to stop at small cities across Ohio.Bob Hope was talented, and a hard worker. He was also sort of a Cad or a Lout, but it was more acceptable to be that way back then. I like the part about how he thought there would be no war in Europe, based partly on the fact that Nazi Germany was the biggest export market for American movies back then. During virtually all of Bob Hope's peak earning decades, most of his income was in the 71 to 85 percent tax bracket. He, and many others, got around this by claiming it in corporations which employed more people and had a lower tax bracket. It seemed to work well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny and interesting book","review":"Two thirds of the book is really good, the history and the anthropology of sex.

Big disappointment. Lack of a positive indexing system makes the duplication of angles very difficult. Each sharpening job includes lots of back and forth adjusting of angle, getting the light right, looking for light under bevel, etc until you think you have it right. Much to your dismay, when you begin sharpening in earnest, this eyeball method usually leaves you off enough to necessitate much more sharpening than you should have to do. This device has not saved me any time. I must admit, however, that any fixed angle results in a better cutting edge than what I can achieve by hand. I am not a gifted sharpener, so I have trouble with some 'rounding' or skewing when sharpening by hand. This jig has at least given me some very sharp tools, but 3 chisels and one plane iron took this perfectionist about 4 hrs to get sharp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless Junk","review":"I read the previous reviews, and thought I could overcome the problems that were listed by them.

You have to be fiddle just to make sure the arms are flush against your workpiece, and then spend time second-guessing the reading that you see. The size of this protractor is convenient, and it's easy to adapt from inner to outer angles, but again, it's just too cheap to be used for serious woodworking.

Our experience with Cutter Advanced with picaridin is much better. No smell, no taste and it keeps the bugs off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it but smells not-so-great","review":"Bought this for my toddlers, and it seems to work pretty well - the odd mosquito manages to get them in odd spots like inner thighs and back of neck - but no complaints and I feel better about using it than any amount of DEET. They hate the smell, so I spray it on my hands first. But hey, OFF is no can of roses either! Strangely, my husband is the one who had a reaction to it - when we use it directly on his skin it makes him a little queasy and nauseous. Sprayed on his clothing, however, and it's no problem. It could be the smell that gets to him and not the formula itself. All in all, I'm really pleased about this product and I will be using it again for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, safe product","review":"I researched DEET-free products for hours, and found that through thorough testing, this product was found to be as effective as products using DEET (found this info on .gov website). Mosquitoes LOVE my children, and I live in Florida near water and plenty of shade, where my children can be outside less than 5 minutes and come in with 20 bites easily. Bite Blocker actually prevents my children from getting bitten (and....safely).It does have a smell to it, but it's not bad enough for me to change products. It's amazing how well this works - I've let my children wear sandals outside and forgotten to spray their feet, and they'll actually come in with mosquito bites on just their feet. These mosquitoes are just waiting to attack, and don't attack where I've sprayed Bite Blocker. I've used their spray as well as their lotion (slightly prefer the spray)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work. Smells awful.","review":"This spray does not repel insects.

I have used other products that have allowed my razor to glide but was looking for something without alcohol. IMHO this product is over priced and doesn't work as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Hype","review":"Very disappointing. I also use a Braun razor. This product improved glide slightly. It did not improve shave closeness at all, even with repeated passes. And the smell is quite unpleasant. Conclusion: incredibly overpriced and ineffective. I can get equal benefit by simply applying a thin layer of aloe vera before shaving. That costs less than a penny an application and is beneficial to the skin. For me, this was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Having made good experiences with BJ products I got curious about the Pre-Shave solution. After applying it the first time I was astonished how fast the skin absorbed it and I could start shaving.

As a 'lay' individual, the book has been encouaraging to me. It has been encouraging in the respect that the author speaks to needs that are often left unthought of, unknown, misunderstood and/or simply ignored. The book covers far more than 'needs' as expressed above.....it is a profound book which speaks to bonds, identity, community, and the impact of the lack thereof. The book also has a personal touch with some of the author's story woven throughout. From my vantage point, the author offers hope and understanding to those of us who are struggling, while at the same time wisely guiding those who are seeking to counsel/support. Wilder is covering important material that is so often poorly understood or simply ignored and dismissed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiderman Spiderman What a Concept Spiderman","review":"This review I am doing with the assistance of my 10 yr old... This game is great. The only bad point is camera control is non-existant. You can only look where they let you. The graphics and scenery is stunning and the villians rock. The best thing about this game is that the 2nd player can come in and out as they please. Meaning, if little brother begs to play and then gets bored with it, you don't have to reset the game. Just let him opt out on the pause screen and you are back to the game.My son has completed the game twice and keeps playing it, He usually finishes a game and it is back to the video store, but not this one.

Sure, Spider-Man is a superhero who fights evil, but Spider-Man is also a character with an incredible set of skills one could apply toward problem solving challenges. Yes, this is a mother talking. My 9-year old loves Spider-Man. Is it so hard to put just a bit more role-model type stuff into these games? That doesn't mean it's not going to be \\"cool\\" anymore.Not far into the game, the bosses become a bit ridiculous to beat where it's not a matter of skill but a matter of how long can your hands manage from totally cramping up because you've performed the same moves for ten minutes straight now. To me, that's lazy programming.

I lifted the water tank and found that the yellow balls/caplets that are part of the filter had come out of the filter and piled up in the water tray.Due to the cheap construction, odd design, and defective unit I will return this and not ask for a replacement. I recommend that you look at a different unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"continous odor","review":"Bought this, set it up and immediatele noticed a srong plastic odor. I let it run for about 8 hrs.Turned it on the next day and the odor was sdtill there.Even a family member noticed it.I changed the water, rinsed the filter, to no avail.3 days later it was still smelling. You noticed it the minute you entered the room, atrong plastic smell.Awful.Sent it back.I noticed a few other people had the same comlpaint. Too bad, other than that it was fine.I have NO idea why it smelled so awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice humidifier overall","review":"I've owened this for a bit over a month. It works as advertised and is quite compact and convenient-easy to transfer from room to room. My only issues are that it only holds a gallon of water, doesn't have an auto shut off, and that it is virtually impossible not to spill some water when removing and replacing the tank when refilling...my advice is refill it over a sink or tub. Other than that it works as well as anyother humidifier I've owned and is VERY quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"White dust","review":"The humidifier is easy to set up, and works well, EXCEPT it puts out a lot of white dust that coats everything. I did not realize when I bought it that it was that kind of vaporizer, or I wouldn't have bought it. I called the company and they said to use distilled water which would get expensive. Consumer Reports rated it well, and I was guided by that. I would NOT buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"We purchased this for my 18 month old daughters room. It's really quiet to the point that if I didn't see the steam coming out I would think it was off! We keep it on the low setting, as her room is very small, and the water lasts for over 12 hours. We've only used it on the warm setting so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing humidifier","review":"The one I had left puddles of water on the floor when running. When the tank had to be removed for filling, it was not possible to remove it without dripping water on the floor. Tank was also quite small and had to be filled more than twice a day to humidify a small room. All in all didn't work right, and I returned it. Got a Venta warm air humidifier with electronic switches and indicators from another vendor which I am quite happy with. For some reason the price from Amazon for the Venta humidifier is much higher than it was elsewhere, and I fail to understand why Amazon quote such a high price to begin with---quite a contrast from their normal low prices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Did Not Work","review":"I don't review a lot of products, but I felt compelled to share my bad experience with this humidifier:1. It leaked within the first week2. The warm mist is not remotely warm3. Lastly, within the first week, the humidifier would not work, and the red light to add more water would not go off.I had a perfectly good Air-O-Swiss humidifier, but it did not have warm mist. So, I thought to trade-up, which was a tremendous mistake. I have bought dozens of products from Amazon, and this was the single worst, the only one I felt that I needed to share my experience. I would advise everyone DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"short-lived functional period","review":"After I bought it, it worked very well for about three months, then stopped working. The engine would be humming, but no steam was produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a few problems with this unit","review":"I have used humidifiers for years. I bought this one because of the reviews I read. The problems I have with it are the following:1) Perhaps the biggest problem is the unit puts out alot of steam and the floor is constantly wet (to the point of my socks getting wet) even though the unit is sitting on a step stool.2) The steam never seems to get warm even though I have it set on the warm setting3) This is the 2nd unit I have had. The 1st unit broke after 2 hours. I had no problem returning it and getting a replacement.It is very easy to clean and to fill. I do like that about it. Wish it worked more like I wanted it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"This is my second humidifier of this kind. I bought the first six months ago and it has worked well to date. Unfortunately the second, the unit in question, was defective straight out of the box. There is a knob on the side of the unit that controls the amount of humid air being produced. In this case, it's as though the knob were set on \\"high\\" even when the opposite is the case. In other words, the product runs on high continuously. I haven't returned it for replacement or repair because I've been much too focused on some personal health issues to be bothered, and because of course I discarded the shipping box before I discovered the problem. So be advised: It's a good humidifier when it works. Just be sure to put it through it paces first, as I should have done. I was careless."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks...","review":"I bought this humidifier after reading many reviews. I noted some customers had problems with leakage but I was hoping that I would not be part of the unlucky group (which seemed to be a minority).Unfortunately, the humidifier does leak. You can only put 1/2 glass of water at the time so that the liquid does not go up to the blue plastic level, where the leakage happens. So it runs out of steam fast. Otherwise it works fine, but still it is just ok for what I need it for, and I am disappointed. I would have bought a much slimmer and simpler model, had I not been swayed by other reviews from customers who did not have the problem. For me, this humidifer is not worth spending the money, not at all. I did not mind the looks although it is ugly, but I do mind that it is not performing."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY WORKS!","review":"Raised my homes humidity in one day from a dry 30% to the perfect 45% that keeps my skin baby soft.

I tried adjusting the dials, I tried using different types of water (spring, distilled, and sink), I tried everything but it only produced a cool mist that burned my nose. My son has terrible allergies and I purchase this in order to help him sleep a night. This item was a waste of time - it blew the mist to the ground instead of into the air. I also was not a fan of the fact that I was going to have to buy a new Ion Exchange Filter every couple of months (I believe it is every 3 or 6 months - please verify the duration of time). I returned this one and went with another that has worked fantastically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died in less than 24 hours...","review":"Despite mixed feedback I took a chance.

I might well be dumb, but it doesn't take too many smarts to realize that if there's a crack in the white plastic around the transducer plate (which is underwater), you're going to have a leak. It also doesn't take a genius to realize that the plastic surrounding a metal plate that is vibrating at ultrasonic frequencies might be prone to cracking.Long story short: If you buy this, run it inside a dish that can hold about twice the volume of water in the tank above. I got a crack within the first 3 hours, but it could happen to yours at any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really misrepresnted","review":"This is by far the worse humidifier I have encountered. Not only is it extremely noisy, it produces some sort of vapor that clings to every surface. I have to dust all the surfaces such as TV screens, printers, other electronic gear, sides of cabinets and tables. I tried to contact their customer service and they refuse to respond. Obviously I used it beyond the Amazon 30 day return, thinking it could be something that would clear up. Not so. I removed the ION filter. No difference. The noise is a continuous dripping, like a defective faucet, and a loud gurgling noise every few seconds.

Was told that the unit was over the one year warranty, and there was nothing they could do to fix the problem. I could not believe their attitude.

Turning the control all the way down still produced quite a bit of mist. Turning it all the way up produced only a little more. The fan on this replacement unit was also a bit noisy. Everything else functioned as expected.I ended up returning this unit for a refund. Again, Amazon handled this extremely well.I ordered the Venta 205 from Amazon. After a month of use, all is well.

I can set it anywhere.- Easy to fill the reservoir that lasts all day at 3/4 dial setting.The only downside with it is you fill the reservoir through a port at the bottom so water usually drips on the floor when you turn it over to set it on the base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 weeks.

This morning (the 5th day) when I took the tank off to re-fill it, the bottom of the vaporizer was completly full of water. So, then I dripped water all over the floor from the bottom of the tank carrying it to the sink.I wanted a bigger sized vaporizer because I have a great room and the smaller vaporizers don't pump out enough steam or mist to moisturize a big room.So, I'll be shopping again for a vaporizer.

This humidifier is practically silent, especially compared to my last one that sounded like an electric toothbrush that was left on.

I realized at first it had less padding and was right on my sit bones, exactly what I was looking for. However, something about the seat design caused the bottom of my legs to hurt.

I usually sit down when riding 10 to 20 miles to reach the trails I want to ride on (of course, I stand up when riding the trails).While this seat has plenty of padding, it's all push instead of cush. I only sat on this seat for a few miles before deciding to turn around to go back home and switch seats. Walking after that was painful, and I received sports massage therapy for the next few weeks to rehabilitate my smashed muscles. I'm better off sitting on steel.

On my new bike I was sore after a four mile ride. I actually started experiencing pain after about two miles. The soreness lasted five days. I would describe myself as average height and average weight. I'm just getting into cycling for exercise/commuting, and do not have cycling shorts. This saddle is roughly the same size as my stock saddle, maybe even slightly smaller. This morning I went on a quick six mile ride wearing just regular cargo shorts, and I feel absolutely zero soreness or pain. The quality seems very good, however I think that the logos are tacky. I wish it was just a plain black saddle, but whatever. I would highly recommend this product based on my experience so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best i've tried","review":"I have been riding for over 25 years and I can honestly say this is the best seat I've ever had; I purchased this seat over five months ago and every time I go biking, which is 4 or 5 times a week, I thank god I got it.

If you're looking for the lightest seat around, this isn't it; mine weighs 390 grams. But if you want to be comfortable for hours on end, buy this seat. I can't recommend it enough. I do my best to keep my mountain bike under 20lbs., so I've saved weight elsewhere to make up for the extra grams of this seat and it's totally worth it. I plan on buying the women's version for my wife soon, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"I have a Trek Road Bike, I am 6 ft 3 in tall and about 235lbs, needed alittle more padding then what was offered on the seat that came on the bike.

Friends and I would take a 50 or 60 mile ride before and have to stop multiple times to relieve the pain in the nether regions. Sometimes to the extent much wasted time would pass by. The A.R.S. has solved my problems and I can now put the miles on without all the stops. The saddle was very firm in the beginning, but has since become more supple without wearing out quickly. So far so good as it has held up to many a mile. I'm pleased the logos/words toward the front came off unlike some actually complained about this. My bike looked more like a billboard with them on it. I would highly recommend this seat for the price although since I purchased it, the price has increased slightly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seat for the price.","review":"I bought this to replace the stock seat on my Fuji Nevada. The rails on this were probably three quarters of an inch taller than the stock seat. There was definitely noticeable difference in comfort over that stock seat.

Overall it is a great product for the price you pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A.R.S as in arse is very funny","review":"I think that this seat fits a niche of people looking for a comfortable saddle at a non-felonious price. I think it is good for those who usually ride without padded shorts. I finally bought some, but didn't have them for 30 years. I found it to be very comfortable, but it may not fit everyone, as everyone is built differently. I think the A.R.S acronym had to be picked intentionally, as in \\"arse\\", and I find that to be very funny. One small thing is that after 5 years, the black is coming off onto my shorts. Time for a new one is all. I would pay a little more for one made of all leather or something. Planet Bike seems to be a company that makes quality parts for the masses. Their lights are good too. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"Add me to the list of happy customers. Bought one of these for my road bike last Fall and love it.

Went on a 25 mile ride to test it out. Got back to my house and realized that I was totally numb \\"down under\\". Not sure how I didn't notice while I was riding, but I didn't. Ordered this seat and went for another 25 miles. I was very observant during this ride making sure to notice anything going on. Got back home and everything was great. Seat did exactly what it is supposed to do. Only problem that I've had was after this last ride I noticed that the seat had slid all the way to the farthest back position. I'm thinking that I just didn't tighten it enough.UPDATE: I've come to the conclusion that this seat is too hard for me past 20-25 miles. I was hoping it would break in softer but it hasn't after about 200+ miles. I will be ordering this seat next and hope that it will be better. http://www.amazon.com/Selle-SMP-TRK-Man-Saddle/dp/B001K12JHK/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_S_nC?ie=UTF8&colid;=1SQ7ORBO1HZ1I&coliid;=I1SA43ACDEO3AN"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable seat, great price","review":"Swapped this for the low-budget seat that came with my low-priced bike and I couldn't be happier.

The seat is comfortable, relatively light, and does not put pressure on the perineum. However, on longer rides (i.e. 100+) it caused a significant amount of friction on my thighs/rear due to the compression/expansion of the foam within the seat. While this was unnoticeable on shorter duration rides, it compounded on the longer ones and I was left with several saddle sores after a year of use.After a 300 mile ride over one weekend I ended up replacing the seat with a Brooks B17. So far, I've been saddle sore free and have never looked back.In short, this is a great seat for shorter conventional rides. But if you enjoy going on longer rides, you should probably invest in a Brooks. While more expensive, it's the best touring seat around and you will end up enjoying touring/randonneuring much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this seat","review":"Finally I can commute to school and not walk funny afterwards.

This film explored on a timeline as close to what happened as possible. It was both horrifing and fascinating to witness. It put a human face on the tragedy, other than seeing and hearing news type coverage about it. It was a throughly engaging film, and at times hard to watch. I couldn't help but get teary eyed during certain parts, that whole experience was totally tragic and disturbing. I hope this film can bring some kind of closure or recogintion to the families of the flight 93 victims. They are of course the most important factor of the film and the reason why it was made. This film should be dedicated in tribute to them, and of course thier loved ones that perished that day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to watch","review":"The one thing I can say about this movie is that it was extraordinarily difficult to watch. After having seen both this and World Trade Center, I can't more highly recommend this movie. It is a serious and realistic treatment of what happened on September 11 - although it is uplifting, for me the more powerful effect of the movie was that it seriously put me back through that terrible day, to a much greater extent than World Trade Center. It is a gut-wrencher, more shaking than any horror movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The swines who come to our country and take advantage of its openness","review":"United 93 is a moving film. The airport scenes of boarding the flight, the wait before take off, the take off, the cabin activity are all real.I cried when the second tower was hit and again when the plane went down.All the actors acted well including the hijackers. Which is why you feel angry at them.What a mess they have made of our country !The cries of the passengers depicts this. The shock and confusion in the control towers depicts this.An excellent film that rivets you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful!","review":"This movie is a fitting tribute to those brave Americans who gave their lives on 9/11/01. I can't imaging it having been done better. It is raw, realistic, and respectful. It drives home all of the shock, vulnerability, and bravery that America experienced and/or observed on that day. This movie captures those aspects of 9/11 with absolutely no political agenda.Some have asked if United 93 came too soon. I don't think so. I'm just impressed that this movie was made with so little 'agenda' this soon after that horrendous and now politically charged event. Americans (including many of the 9/11 families) and our politicians could take a lesson away from this powerful film...To use the events of 9/11/01 for personal or political gain does nothing to honor those who made the ultimate sacrifice almost 5 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"United 93","review":"It is a well-directed movie and it keeps you at the edge of the seat.The events will unfold petty fast and the story is not dragging or lost the stream.

I wanted to leave, but I couldn't get up. I had to keep sighing to avoid crying out. It was not fun. But it was clearly something we need not to forget. And I was glad a Brit did it. I hope that we as a people learn something---what would it be? To have better security? To understand why people are raised to think that suicide bombing with aircraft is religious? What was it I was supposed to get? I only got the pain. Maybe that was enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Difficult Movies I've Ever Had to Watch","review":"When I say I had to watch this film, I think any American needs to see this to even partially understand what these ordinary civilians sacrificed on that morning. It's similar to watching Schindler's List; it's a horrific event that no one should have to go through, but it so powerfully illustrates the human spirit that you can't help but be overcome. Some found this whole movie to be in bad taste, but I would bet the majority of them never watched it. I've never seen a film that makes you so proud to be a human being, then so fully crushes your spirit until you're in tears. The last 10 minutes or so are very hard to watch, and I had a lump in my throat when the final scene faded to black. These people were truly heroes, they weren't even sure what the target was, or if their plan would work, yet they all sacrificed their lives so that others might live. They deserve a chronicle of these events for history's sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Beyond Anything Before","review":"I have read,researched,and studied this subject in great length and nothing prepared for the trip I took on United 93 last night.I was on the edge of my seat all through the movie and at times really felt I was there.The camera movements can and will make people dizzy but you get used to it fast.The main characters were hardly introduced and not dwelled upon like you would think or read about.Some are portayed not to have helped in the revolt but all were certainly heros to have endured the horror that unfolded.I felt at times wanting to jump up and go after the cowardly hijackers but then remembered I was just an observer.Everyone should see this movie and it's not too early to tell the story.As powerful as anything as I've seen in the last 20 years and if you are not moved by this you could be all dead inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"A visual torture","review":"A visual torture. . .I don't find that this documentary tells us anything we didn't know from the media.My primary objection to the movie is that it is a visual torture, with camera work having the quality of a home movie.

It's not well executed and when it was over, I was mad and ready for some revenge! Of course this is the intended response and the manipulation of the audience by the film makers is just plain shameful! This felt like a bad TV movie and the viewers can't help but feel sad and angry while watching this movie. It's the equivalent to making a film about Jonbenet Ramsey back when the crime was fresh and having a graphic murder/sex scene showing the poor child's horrible demise! The DVD transfer looks very good, but I liked World Trade Center much more than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"mom, this is Mark Bingham, you do believe me don't you?","review":"\\"Mom, this is Mark Bingham... you do believe me don't you?\\"When I first heard this I wondered \\"What kind of idiot writes this stuff?\\"Now I know."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bitter Disappointment","review":"I lost an old friend in this tragedy. Colleen Fraser was played by an unknown (name forgotten), who like Colleen, was short in height. Unlike Colleen, this woman was practically silent throughout the tragic film. We may never learn the truth about this horror, nor of the WTC/Pentagonlosses in life. I, too, saw the WTC movie, and I liked it far more than this flop. Doesn't matter if ithad big star celebs in the movie, or a bunch of unknowns within if the story was poorly researched and written up just to cash in on a horrible incident.

It was clear to the prospective hyjackers that American passengers would not permit their plane to be used as a weapon against our country.The bravery and resolution of the passengers filled me with admiration and a sense of terrible loss. Many of the passengers families were called from the plane and learned of the hyjacking and the passengers resolution. All of the families were interviewed by the folks who made this film. No film stars were used in the picture.

Kids may be bored by all the grown-up confusion at the beginning in the control tower, Norad etc. I took my 9 year old to see it because she liked the TV version so much. I would have liked to have seen more character development, like the one they showed on TV that had both sides of the phone conversation the passengers had with those at home. But all in all this was a good movie that of course made me cry at the end.The hijackers are not portrayed as brave or noble,just as the misguided cowards they are. I also like the fact that the cast was just a bunch of ordinary people-nothing glamorous!Which is awesome because that is what they were-regular people like you and me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Could Have Been Done Without the \\"F\\" Bomb!","review":"The movie showed an excellent behind the scenes look at the mounting tension within the governmental agencies and the military on 9/11.

No wonder we live in a country where a corporation now is considered a \\"person\\". Well, not in my world.There are so many other days of the year this movie could have been released, so clearly this was a well-thought out marketing decision.To the person who called me \\"ignorant\\" for my opinion - I'm neither ignorant in general nor ignorant about the topic of 9/11 having lost a son in the second tower to collapse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too soon","review":"This movie is fiction.

It is a powerful film for several reasons. First, because we know what is going to happen and are reliving the full horror and dread of that day. In addition, the director made a wise decision to cast unknown actors and a number of non-actors (such as the flight controllers). Finally, the story itself - of the passengers coming to the awareness that they are most likely going to die and, without heroics, making sure that the plane isn't a weapon like the prior three - is moving and well-told."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:United 93 manages to work as an incredibly skillfull thriller, building a great deal of tension up to a climax, and as a testament to those who lost their lives on 9/11; either way you slice it it's quite a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't happen?

The amount of countless hours of research and interviews he must have gone through, is totally present in every minute of the film, richly detailed and totally mesmorizing.Certainly not a five star movie, but five star in his writing and directing, without question.BUY this for your collection, the wide screen certainly brings more to the eye, methinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Truly realistic and heartfelt, and will break your heart and bring tears to your eyes.

There are numerous examples and the material is clearly presented. However, there are weak points. One is brevity, as pointed out by the first reviewer. The coverage of the subject of perturbation methods is minimal and some of the topics that are covered are done so with little depth. Another drawback is the emphasis, when discussing applications, on fluids and to a lesser extent mechanics. This makes it somewhat old fashioned. The greatest drawback is the exercises.

For instance, some vowel symbols that touch the main part of the letter are formed on the left side of the letter, instead of the right, indicating that this is a very old style and not reflective of current forming of Telugu letters.

The intention was to present him as a rival to Louis Armstrong, and on the basis of the ten sides from his Rhythm Aces' 1929 output presented here, that could have been possible. Milt Hinton's argument, as set out in the liner note, was that his attitude stood in the way, but my own feeling is Louis' playing was more accessible to the man in the street.Listened to in its own right, it's high octane virtuoso playing, ably supported by his Aces. The remaining six tracks sample his work with Charlie Johnson's Paradise Ten, Lloyd Smith & his Gut-Bucketeers, Alex Hill & his Orchestra, and Ikey Robinson & his Band.

The plot is nonsense of course. A rocket from Earth arrives on Venus to explore. Many of the shots were stock footage of an earlier Soviet film, but in Bogdanovich's early hands, one does not see an iota of the genius that he would later show. The women are mostly blonde busty beauties who communicate telepathically. When they realize that their pterodactyl god is less powerful than a Robby the Robot type from earth, they gladly switch allegiance. This film takes itself too seriously for viewers to see any traces of camp. The sight of Miss Van Doren in sea shell bras and hip hugging capris palls pretty quickly.

These two musicians have a way of blending their lines so perfectly that it is as if the music is playing them instead of the other way around. The bass playing of Charnett Moffet is equal to the task of keeping up with these two musical geniuses. The first cut Serro De Mar is stunningly beautiful and the latin tinged Manalyuca is driven by a haunting bassline supplied by Moffet. Although these two tunes are highlights the rest of the cd is all good. McCoy Tymer's piano playing is fuller harmonically than many others I've listened to and his chord voicing is complex yet accessable. Land Of the Giants provides an opportunity to hear these fine musicians in their prime creative years and it is not to be missed. A really fine CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt Leather Belt???

The only part that was good about it was the mic, and that quit working. The cords seam to get frayed quite easily and because of that the mic no longer works. These headphones are terrible.

Comfort: The floating speaker design doesn't work as well as one might hope. The set gets uncomfortable after about 30 minutes. Maybe more padding would have helped.2. 3-D?: When I turned the feature on things seemed to sound a bit better but I'd hesitate to call it 3-D. Not really worth touting. It sounds more like a gain setting than 3-D.3. Inconvenience: The \\"3-D\\" module, which resides mid-line and has a built-in volume control, needs a AA battery to operate. This battery also seems to powers the mic. So if the battery dies... no microphone and no 3-D effect. At least that's how mine seems to work, or rather, not work.Keeping in mind the old adage \\"You get what you pay for.\\", these are not horrible, but were I you, I'd spend a few more bucks and go up a rung in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down","review":"First off, this headset is uncomfortable. As far as I know, there is no way to adjust it so it fits one's head better, and after twenty or so minutes, it starts to hurt one's head. I had to move it to different places on my head often so it wouldn't hurt. Plus, the earphones don't wrap around the ears, they just kind of push up against them, which isn't too comfortable.The sound quality is decent. The surround sound one can only hear if the volume is up, which is fine for me...I always turn the volume up loud. But, unless one is like me, don't bother getting these for the surround sound.The worst thing about these, in my opinion, is the remote for the surround/volume. After only a couple weeks, the sound only worked in one ear, and I had to fiddle with where the cords plug into the remote.The microphone, according to people I play with online, is good quality. Everyone could hear me find. It is nice that the mic is also flexible, so one can move it wherever.Don't get this headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total junk","review":"The sound is very dodgy to begin with. The surround sound function seems to come and go. But that's not my real issue with these clunkers, my real issue is that they have to be the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn. I can only go about 30 minutes and I have to tear them off, for fear that they will crush my ears into unrecognizable pieces of cabbage. Previous reviews mention this problem, I ignored them, so my bad. But please heed this warning: they will crush you little ears to pulp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Buy","review":"I have bought a lot of gaming headsets over the years...I have been gaming since 1995..I like this company ..

The hood does not stay secure over the lens, but if you carry a small roll of tape, you can use a couple pieces to secure it.I have only used this in practice, but came out with some very good, clear results. Like others, I know this is a zoom lens, but wish you could be able to back off the zoom a bit with out getting the tunnel effect. I think it will work out well, though. As to price, it's fair, especially as DSLR lenses run in the thousands, not mere $200.00 and less. Oh, yes, I purchsed this lens from Canon, and theAmazon price is considerably less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but nice","review":"Not an ideal situation as the lens restricks the camera minimum zoom about 1/3. So minimum zoom is no longer the minimum. But it takes great indoor shots without a flash so I expect better things when outside. Also note that a polarizer that fit the adapter does not fit this lens. So you either use the adapter with the polarizer or the adapter and this zoom but not both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! May not be what you expect.","review":"I just received the Canon TC-DC58B and put it to the test. I took non-digital zoom shots, at full magnification, with and without the converter and was instantly disappointed. What disappointed me was that the extra magnification I got was a lot less than I expected. There was little difference in the two shots. In fact, I could get the same magnification by minimally employing the digital zoom feature. I am going to Alaska for the first time soon and was hoping the lens would help me get up close and personal with nature. I doubt it will get me much closer at all. I've read through the reveiws and would agree with the quality of the lens, etc. I don't see where those who rated this a 4 or 5 even mentioned the fact that you will not get much closer with this lens. I don't like spending over a $100 for something and being left with the feeling that I did not get much bang for my buck. Beware and think twice about buying this.

It is also a nuisance because you have to switch the camera settings every time you use the lens for it to function properly. This is no big deal with the wide angle adaptor, which is used infrequently by me, but it is when you want to capture a fleeting image at a distance. It is lightweight, but cumbersome and doesn't accept filters. For real telephoto capabilities, get an SLR with interchangeable lenses. I sent this product back."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"Does very little to improve objects in the distance. Save your money for another camera would be my suggestion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A necessity","review":"Canon has created a market for accessories for its digital cameras. Since it is not an SLR, to add a new lens (close-up or zoom) you have to use the tele converter lens as an adapter. Not much of a problem, but it does have an annoying problem of not fitting snugly, so there is some play in it when it is attached to the existing camera lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only","review":"I enjoy the ability to add zoom to a non-SLR camera. I have backpacked the Tour de France 3 times and could not afford the weight and size of an SLR rig along with a video camera. My Canon S1 was perfect...except for podium shots where the zoom was maxed. This lens isn't amazing, but will add more power - and it may be enough for you to justify its price (and the fact that it makes the camera HUGE). I'm taking this one to NY this weekend for a trial run.My only regret? You cannot add a snap-on/secure lens cap as it has no threading. And IF IT WERE ONLY METAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Teleconverter","review":"This teleconverter delivers exactly what it promises, for a reasonable price. The 1.5x conversion gives you a focal equivalent of over 600mm, and with the camera's built-in image stabilization you can shoot at full zoom without a tripod. Try doing that with a conventional lens...The only reason this product didn't get 5 stars from me is that you need to use it at almost full zoom exclusively. If you don't fully zoom, you get a barrel effect from the inside of the converter. Having said that, I wish I had bought this converter back when I bought my S2 instead of letting two years slip by. It's a worthwhile addition that lets you stretch the capabilities of a great super zoom camera a little farther, and deserves a place in your camera bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Canon lens!

Add the zoom and we could see the people fishing off the pier and a person empting a bucket on the boat.You have to take it off for close things or the lens gives you a nice circle around your subject, but hey it is a zoom lens for stuff you can not see with the camera's built in lens.Sometimes at full zoom there is a little distortion at the edges of the picture.

Sadly, this is the second Molly P original doll we had to return. The other one's wig fell off entirely the very first day. At further inspection of this doll, I noticed that the wig on this doll is not secure either, at the nape of the neck. It is not falling off at this time, but it is likely just a matter of time.

In short, kuru is a disease of the CNS caused by cannablism (similar to mad cow disease). The studies take place around the '70s, and by then cannablism was on the decline, and resultingly the disease also became rare.

I would have liked to have read more information concerning Kuru, how it changed the Fore' and (as would be the natural course of the disease if the cause (cannibalism) had in fact been removed) if there are no new instances of thedisease. The book makes the point of attaching the incidence of cannibalism to a shortage of protein in the diet of Fore' women and children.

There is nothing here that will convert anyone who is not already predisposed to support a Clinton Restoration. It reads like a lawyer's brief with inconvenient facts left out or glossed over. Still, it does provide a window into the mind of a Clintonista who clearly has been champing at the bit to get back into power after eight years of the Bush Terror. Sad, in a way.

It's a masterful piece of propaganda, and reads well - as one might expect from a writer as talented as Ms. Estrich. But it is propaganda nonetheless.

No one should underestimate Hillary's chances. We Republicans don't seem to have an alternative besides Condi Rice to run against Hillary...and Condi keeps saying she won't run. We don't have anyone with the name recognition.

It doesn't seem to leak when the lid is closed, but when open, if the cup is turned on its side or upside down, the liquid just pours right out of the air valve. Ridiculous. My daughter just turned the cup over and enjoyed 'drawing' with the milk that came out in a steady stream.I returned the cups immediately.More worrisome is the fact that several reviewers mention their children getting hurt, one needing ten stitches, from either being pinched by the lid mechanism or cut by the sharp edge of the lid.

I can see what's wrong: Tighten the lid to avoid leakage at the rim, and the straw unit twists ever so slightly, creating a tiny gap where the straw pops through the lid. We've had multiple floods in my daughter's lunch box, and my email to the company last week so far has gone unanswered.We're now using an older plastic Thermos that a) doesn't keep liquids as cool and b) hogs lunch box space.

Im a prop builder / designer so my opinion is kinda picky when it comes to items recreated from movies and TV. So if your a causal fan it doesn't really matter.I just thought some people might like to know.This shirt suffers from the same problem most officially licensed items have in that it's accurate enough for people not to notice details. That the typeface is wrong and the colors are lighter then in the show, the circle and symbol is too thin and the placing of the Sony copyright logo right under the \\"ma'am\\" is sort of annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"the t-shirt was for my son.

They work great and dont jam. The staples in the box are all in solid rows - none of the rows arrived broken in half or in little pieces as sometimes happens. I will note that the box arrived with a rubber band around the box of staples to keep it closed - but it seems to have been unnecessary.My only criticism is that I wish they would figure out a better way to box these.

She is forthright about her own shortcomings but paints a detailed and vivid picture of the situation on the ground after the American invasion. The incompetence and cockiness of the Bush administration is laid bare--by someone who should have been one of their biggest supporters. The sexist culture of the military at every level is the second line of this story, but Karpinski never whines--and, until she was stabbed in the back by her own people, she never let her stop going after the career she wanted. A must read, if you want a balanced view."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Responsible Book","review":"This book gives General Karpinski's side of the story. It's excellent, and I think it's honest. She says three times at least that she takes responsibility for what she did wrong, and on two occasions lists mistakes she made. Everyone agrees that she did not condone or generate the torture that occurred at Abu Ghraib (otherwise her punishment would have been much more severe than mere demotion) but instead was entirely blindsided by it, in part because of a mixed up chain of command. That is not in dispute; her book merely gives the details, from her point of view. It's one of the best ghost-written biographies I've ever read, about an important current issue and, given that it is a piece of advocacy, frank and complete. Reviewers who say she does not accept her share of the blame have not read the book.For some reason I can't give the book the four stars I meant to.

I rate it four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Leader's Spin","review":"The author is very adept at pointing her fingers of blame.

I am infuriated at her actions throughout the book. Simply she should have not been promoted and placed in this capacity. A sad comment that one who served in the military knows...\\"There are no bad troops, only bad leaders.\\" Karpinski fits this mold and this book does her no justice as the truth was pointed out in the Army's investigation.

But it is poorly writen and very hard to read without throwing up.I believe Janis Karpinski is nothing more than a pompas ***.That would be fine if it ended there, but she failes to even remotely accept any kind of responsibility.That should be enough to discredit her. If I have a job managing a business, and that business endures massive fines as a result of ethics or whatever, who is to blame ?Well, I think I would be out on my *** looking for another job, and I would doubt that anyone would care who I felt like blaming.Did the enron guys get a book for running enron into the ground and taking many people with it? No.She is nothing more than a coward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Whining.....","review":"This poorly written book amounts to a lot of whining by an incompetent woman who never, never should have been a general, or even a colonel.

The coloration and shading are inconsistent with the photograph on the Amazon listing page. Additionally, there is a tag attached to the umbrella with a photo that again does not match the product. There is not as much outlining of the leaves as depicted in the photo, and it is not dark, it is a medium to light brown color. The reduced outlining/shading results in the greens and yellows being quite garish. Take my word, these details make a big difference.

Also, the mission objectives seem unclear causing the player to do things that do not go along with the objectives. I have even received some mission objectives in German! A patch would be great for the bugs listed. Otherwise I love it. There are lots of things to smash so even my artillery is gaining elite status.

Well..I finished THE LAST CITY ROOM and enjoyed every page.The characters are developed where you care about them (even the bad guys...to get their due)and the events and personalities are interesting and true-to-life. On one side the reader can see where a reporter could be a celebrity type person where they are in the spotlight and then again the job could be filled with drudgery and danger....as well as low paying to the extreme.This story depicts the times of the sixties and many of the events that went on at that time.

Anti-gay slurs abound from the mouths of the characters, who, of course, are creations of the author. The most evil man in the novel, a Nazi-like police chief, is a closet case with a predilection for pretty young men. The author created that character too. When another character uses racist words, he is taken to task. Nothing of the sort happens to anyone who uses anti-gay slurs and one can only conclude that the author wanted it that way. I cannot recommend this piece of trash to anyone. I looked at the author's blog, where he very unconvincingly denies being a homophobe, but quit seeing a doctor who he thought might be interested in him without even finding out if he was right. But, the doctor was a proctologist, and I wonder if he saw something in the author and decided to take a hike on his own."},{"rating":"1","title":"overkill","review":"The material is good, but the author get to involved to soon in the text.

However, the photos showing card cheating techniques are missing. Also, the reprint is the abridged paperback version by Mass Paperbacks. While Dover is famous for printing its books on high quality paper that are signature-stitched so that it can last a lifetime (and possibly be rebound), none of this is present. The paper it's printed on is like the paper of a low-quality paperback and not signature-stitched.

Now I learn that he invented every other popular card game out there. Don't waste your time or money reading this book. Scarne wastes most of the space, as he does in his other books, bragging about himself. The book is over 400 pages long and it only addresses NINE games: Gin Rummy, Black Jack, Poker, Pinochle, Cribbage, Pitch, Casino, Kalabrais, and Hearts (including, of course, \\"Hearts According to Scarne\\"). Now, if you really really wanna learn how to determine if someone's cheating you in Rummy or determine if the cards in your Pinochle game are marked, I guess you can read those chapters.

You at least get a caravan/little house with a door, windows, and stairs with the Travis set, my pick for the best of the series. Even the Muck set that comes with the recycling bins and chute offers more play value.With all the vehicles, you can't play heavy with them, as the pieces usually pop off. This set is very pricey, so I would only get it if your child has to have these two characters, becauase that's all you are paying for.

I like the way Cedric explains about how he cannot call a grown man \\"delicious\\" or how he does not have all night to make love.

It conflates the definition with \\"actual cause\\" and then says a \\"but for\\" test is used to determine proximate cause. I realize that some judges even get this wrong, but I would be afraid to use an encyclopedia that does.I will go check out an actual copy and then modify this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping","review":"Ordered this cd and with-in 4 days i recieved it when i bought it the title said \\"like new\\" but when i got it i was like whow i could swear it was new. no marks or scraches to the cd or the case.would recommend to any one lookin for a good relax and be stress free disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact hose reel","review":"Nice for the price, very compact yet holds 40+ feet of medium-sized hose. NOT a live reel, you need to disconnect your hose before winding on to this reel. Tension feature and folding handle both work well. Clamps easily to several sizes of round and square tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done!","review":"This is a very good product that gets everything done. Only downside is that the lcd light doesn't stay on. Other than that good product for it's price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Doesnt any one else make selectors like this?","review":"This slector is great! It has 6 component video (red,blue,green) inputs, 4 optic fiber inputs, and outputs component and optic fiber. Great for HDTV and 5.1 surround sound. 5 star product."},{"rating":"1","title":"please pack with care for shipping!","review":"When these staples arrived, the package was open, and they had all spilled out throughout the box. Almost all of the staples are unusable - unless I load them 2 at a time! This was very disappointing and inconvenient, as it is difficult to find P22 staples in stores, and now I have a box of unusable ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"They don't fit ... not 5/16-Inch staples","review":"Don't fit - wouldn't fit my 5/16-inch stapler and wouldn't fit m,y wife's 5/16-inch stapler. Different manufacturers too - of for 2 STINKS !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sniper Mission","review":"This game is so fun, graphic, the missions. Best of all is the On-line games, I thought there was going to be lagging and alot of delay.. no there is none of that. This game is my fav, think I am almost addicted. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"The single player is a bit short, but so what. The multiplayer is the reason everyone loves this game. I think it is right up there with Doom 2 and JB Golden eye on N64. If you like multi-player first-person deathmach action, then CoD4 will not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have game for any PS3 owner","review":"If you are reading this, do yourself a big favor and buy this game. It will showcase the graphics and sound you were looking for when you bought it. A must own game, bottom line. Multiplayer is amazing! BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift to my nephew","review":"My nephew wanted this game for his birthday. He is very happy with the product and it was received in a timely manner with no problems. Thank you,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"It's not a perfect game, as some people have noted. But I do think it is amazing.I played through the single player game, that was interesting, albeit a little linear for my liking. But the game really comes alive in multi player.If there were no multi player, I'd probably rate this three stars and call it over priced. But the inclusion of such a comprehensive multi player experience makes this game outstanding.There are plenty of weapons to choose from, all kinds of unlockables and promotions. You get to pit your wits against players from all over the world. It's just a great game. And I am not a huge FPS player, I'm not even a very enthusiastic gamer quite honestly, but this game will provide hours of entertainment, and is certainly a must have for any PS3 owner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer war game","review":"Much better than the WWII type scenarios. Everything was awesome with the exception of one thing, the length of the game. I finished it in 3 days and I did not play all day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"I bought this for my 19 yr old son and he literally spent his every waking moment during his college break playing \\"call of duty\\". He played online and couldn't believe how entertaining it was..He said it was by far the best video game yet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"I really enjoyed playing call of duty 4. The playstation 3 has allot of power and it really shows with the game. I say this is a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ghost Recon 2","review":"COD 4 is a much better and more realistic game than Ghost Recon 2. The only thing it lacks is length. I think they could have had another mission. There are a few different bad guys out there that they could have put in the game. After 6 hours of gameing the story ended. The game itself was very realistic, made me feel I was back in Iraq sometimes.The little mission after all the credits is probably the funnest mission of the game. There should be more of those in the game next time. So once you beat this game let the credits roll through there is one more mission after the credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best FPS game ever","review":"I've played this game over 300 hours and am still playing it now. I just went through story mode at Veteran difficulty and I have a new-found respect for real Marines. This is the best First Person Shooter (FPS) game ever made. The graphics are ultra-realistic. The gameplay is smooth (except for a few minor areas) in both story mode and online play. My main complaint is that you can't mute other online players -- so you have to listen to little Timmy ordering dinner from Pizza Hut. Nevertheless, in comparison with anything from EA/Ubisoft, this is 10 times better. Drake's fortune was fun but there's no online play. If you only buy one game, this is the one. I'd buy a PS3 just to play this game. BTW: I have the PC version too but I can't master the controls. If you get a modded PS3 controller, you get a big advantage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game ever after a year","review":"I've had this game since it was released in late 2007, so it's been almost a year.I have a number of games in a number of genres for my PS3, but I constantly find myself reaching for this to play. Of course, personal taste will determine if you like first-person shooters or not, but no one can deny that this is a well-made game.The game is fastpaced and chaotic but extremely fun once you get oriented. Prior to this, my experience with FPS games was limited to the PC. It took a few hours and days to get better at controlling the two analog sticks.The game on all three platforms is great, so if you are looking for a new game to pick up and don't already have it, buy this game, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game, no 2-player co-op!","review":"1. Amazing gameplay on single player.2. Graphics are awesome.3. Intense missions, excellent transitions, variable viewpoints (i.e. aerial missions, tanks, traditional ground missions, etc.)4. No 2 player co-op?!? Only reason my review's not 5 stars.5. Get this game, and enjoy the single player. Then go online and get ravaged by 13 year olds with nothing better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game of the Year 07","review":"I love this game. I have lost plenty of spare time due to my inability to put the controller down. You've got to own this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best PS3 shooter so far !","review":"Definetaly a bench mark for the first person shooter genre. Detail is everything, thus the scenery and the sound are amazing in this project. The loading sequences are some of the best I've seen so far. Overall a Very enjoyable experience. Well done Infinity Ward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game and very real graphics.","review":"This game is increadible for single player. Some of the missions are awesome. The only thing lacking is there is no cooperative play, like COD World at War."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT ORDER","review":"This game has a virus on it, do not purchase it! It almost ruined my husband's PS3. I bought it on accident, thinking it was another COD game. When it arrived my husband put it into the PS3 & immediately the screen froze, and it started doing weird things to the PS3. Ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Graphics","review":"Excellent FPS game, I have played in a long time...The frame moves pretty smooth, and very nice story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"If you like first person war shooters this game is it for PS3 so far... Graphics, realism, and depth of each level are top notch. Only complaint I had was the time it took to beat, game was finished in less than two sittings on the first difficulty level. I've since begun again on a harder setting and its taking a bit more time and still just as fun. Overal best game I've played yet for my PS3. If you don't like this game you just don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Addicting, WAY better than previous versions of SOCOM","review":"What can I say? I know military games and this is one of the best I have ever played, on and offline.Online play was stunted for about 2 months after they put a patch that basically rendered online play impossible. But they have since fixed this problem and I play this all the time.I was sort of upset that they stopped making the PS3 60GB that had PS2 backwards compatibility hardwired in, but after playing this it made me say, who cares about the PS2?!Gameplay is spectacular, and feels very realistic, not like Resistance which feels more like an arcade game than a military FPS (First Person Shooter).Infinity Ward always makes first class software and this game is no exception. It is important to note that the next COD will not be made by Infinity Ward and will most likely suck.Happy Shooting!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent action! Multiplayer very strong!","review":"Quite possibly the most fun I've had on a console. I'm a big war-based FPS fan and Call of Duty 4 really delivers. The single player is a great story, but where this game really shines is the multiplayer. Nothing like putting three M-16 rounds in some guys head as he tries to run from one building to another or across open ground! Do yourself a favor and get this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game goes Down on 6/18/08","review":"Once SOCOM Confrontations comes out on june 18th get ready to find no one online in COD4"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Fancy graphics, weak gameplay, 4th-rate AI. No two player co-op! High difficulty settings means the enemy has perfect, long distance full-auto aim and magical ability to know where you are. This pushes this game from the First Person Shooter to the Fantasy catagory. Rent, Do Not Buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"AOD4 sucks sucks","review":"Haveing read numerous review, i decided to buy. After playing, i hate it. I get stuck in the campaign. Too boring i have to pratice over the same tutorial. There is no 1vs1 for beginner offline where i learn and have fun at the same time. sucks. No fun for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"???????","review":"The game was really intense until German Shepherds were used to be killed.It really surprised me that I had to shoot a dog in this game. Really sucks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the best PS3 game","review":"I can't believe all the positive feedbacks for this game. I only able to play 15 minutes of it and had enough. With the choppy graphics, badly animated characters, I wonder if I was playing PS1 title. Forgive me if you don't happen to agree with my review here, but IMO, do not buy this game. I am glad I rented it first. Worse game ever. Now, I saw Ghost Recon and that is what I call next gen game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, great service by amazon.","review":"I chose free shipping and it was delivered on time, this game is fun, overall a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"The game changer game of all FPS","review":"This game will probably have so many ports in the future for changing the FPS genre. maybe even to the PS Vita.
