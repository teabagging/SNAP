The only reason I can figure out it could have got a Nobel prize is because it was written by a black author and had black characters in it. I read a lot of Oprah Winfrey's book club materials and I was disapointed that she selected this one. I had a lot of empathy for the characters tragedies. After I finished the book the characters ordeals stayed in my mind, but overall I was left with a bad feeling. I refuse to even see the movie. This book did not deserve the recognization it received. It was an ok story, but nothing great. Toni Morrison appears to be very prejudiced and biased and it certainly comes out in her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not highly recommended for teens","review":"I read Beloved as an assignment for school and I was left completely confused. The novel, in its entirety, is overpowering and at times I found myself afraid to turn the page for fear of what I may read next. At other times, I had to flip back 5 pages and start sections over again because I was lost. I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"It is may be considered vain for a high school student to disagree with the Noble Prize for literature, but in this case I'll risk it. Belved by Toni Morrison was hard to follow and even harder to like. Toni Morrison accomplishes her objective of showing the reader the horrors of slavery but the rest of the story is often silly. The book takes place in Post Civil War rural Cincinnati. It deals with such themes as isotion, guilt, remorse, and the supernatural. Another defect to this book is that the superatural seems out of place in this book. The book starts ordinarily and then a ghost appers. In Beloved, Toni Morrison overdoes her story making her book slow and unenjoyable. But diffrent strokes, some may love this novel but Ill stick by my negative criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fail to see what everyone finds so great about this book.","review":"I am a fan of Orson Scott Card, who believes that if a writer has something to present, he should present it and quit hinting and beating around the bush. And I agree. But the entire time I read <i>Beloved,</i> I felt as if there were a plethora of ideas that Toni Morrison wanted to get across, but she just WOULDN'T DO IT. And it drove me crazy. The story itself is actually very short, but it is told upwards of six times in flashback, each time with minutely more detail, which I guess would be fine had I been able to CARE about the story anymore by the time I got to the point where it was all explained. Basically this is a boring meaningless story about a woman who kills her daughter, but really ISN'T about a woman who kills her daughter say many critics; I think they're making it up. If it were possible to give this book ZERO stars I would do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult","review":"I have a very difficult time understanding Toni Morrison's style of writing. Since I could't understand her style I couldn't enjoy the content.I ended up returning it to the library without finishing it because it was horribly over due. I just couldn't bring myself to finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good images, good technique, STUPID characters","review":"I HATE this book. Although technically well-written, in a lush imagistic style, its main character Sethe utterly disgusts me. She goes on and on, telling the reader irrelevant and sickening detail about her brutal life as a slave, while focusing on the most meaningless, useless, STUPID details in the present. Some of the supporting characters are no better. Do I really want to read about sex crimes on cows? NO!! This novel has all the finesse of a blind brachiosaur ramapaging through a china market; I threw it down in utter disgust by chapter. Its characters fail to gain any sympathy whatsoever from I, the reader, simply because their motivations are so petty, inconsequential, their observation so niggling and obsessive, their whole beings and selves STUPID and IGNORANT. This novel deserves to have a rating of -3 but unfortunately the scale doesn't go that low. As for the writer, she should have her prize taken away. Make that all her prizes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Edition not as described","review":"For my English class, I needed a specific edition of the book \\"Beloved.\\" Instead of the edition depicted, I got the WRONG edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service","review":"Book came sooner then ever in great reading condition as mentioned. Ordered it the 5th came on the 8th. Thank you so much, now I can read my summer book without worrying about returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of Oprah, do not read!","review":"This book epitomizes undeserved recognition for something that is for shock factor. I had to read this in college in a Modern novel course, and out of all the great reads, this was by far the worst! Story was way too long and did nothing for me (and the movie was even worse - do not want to see Oprah naked...ever!). It's amazing to me how much people talk about this book (or Song of Solomon which i had to read an hated) b/c there is nothing valuable in here. Go read something good like \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" \\"To Kill A Mockingbird,\\" \\"Sister Carrie,\\" anything else, please!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Foolish Fiction","review":"This book is really disturbing and filled with emotional persuassion which has no basis in fact. It is very hard to understand and is not worth the read. If a child wrote a book like this - they would probably get hauled off to iron bars for being psychotic. The book is not interesting. If you really want to find out about it - watch the movie. This book is a political sham of fictitious events & emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many technics","review":"I believe that Toni Morrison made this book to see how people are stupid.There is no verisimilitude. Some sentences are void of meaning.I am not impressed at all and I regret if she is the best author the U.S. can produce (Nobel Prize.)This is not even fantastic.She has the quality of a journalist, and knowledge, and technics from her experiences, but she has no talent as a writer.Overuse of punctuation -- a writer doesn't use punctuation for a meaning like the ';' for the rupture between Sethe and her kids. This is overuse of technics and some sentences mean nothing at all.I think it is a mock-novel ! (to see how people can like something evily done)"},{"rating":"1","title":"frustrating","review":"Beloved is an extremely frustrating book. Too many flashbacks, too much illogic, and too little cohesion. Beloved never decides what it wants to be: Is it a ghost story? Is it a study of the afteraffects of slavery? Is it a coming of age tale? It's a book that you feel you ought to read instead of being one that you really want to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Forced and contrived. Even worse in the fact that the parts not involing a perverted-ghost-baby-women are pretty good and intresting, the ghost-baby-women who is supposed ti represent slavery (?) is just over the top. Not a single person in class liked this. Shows how far american lit still needs to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL NOVEL","review":"I must say that Toni Morrison is indeed one of my top three favorite authors. When I first saw this movie at the time of its release, I must admit, I didn't really enjoy it. I thought it was hard to follow in that format and the recollections disjointed. The novel, however, especially Ms Morrison's reading of it is totally the opposite. I am thoroughly enjoying it, soaking up the experiences presented, and recommending to anyone who will listen (no pun intended). I will watch the movie again when I'm finished the the audio book, and I've already pre-ordered her upcoming novel. She is an inspirational author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to ignore","review":"Admittedly, I was lost at times while reading this, read many a chapter and sentence over and over, but by the end, I found the effort more than worth it. I can't pretend to know what it must have been like for women/slaves like Sethe, but if I've now gleaned even an inkling, this was the story that did it.Much like after reading the Color Purple, I found myself thinking about this story again and again, and would highly recommend it for anyone with the patience to see it through. The pay off is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the extraordinary works of the 20th century...","review":"There are a dozen reasons to resist Beloved: It is too PC, Morrison supports O.J. Simpson, magical realism and stream-of-consciousness are passé. Nonetheless, Beloved is one of the extraordinary works of the 20th century. It combines a compelling story, a profound depiction of slavery and its human consequences, insight into pride, consciousness and self-awareness. The author's style fits the tale on several levels: its portrayal of an institution and experience too hideous to convey in conventional terms, its roots in the African story-telling modes and, finally, a sonorous resonance. The final pathos in the plot is its roots in a historic incident.As an avid reader, I'm surprised it took me fifteen years to catch up with Beloved. It has left an indelible impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and strange","review":"I expected Beloved to be a stunning, riveting semi-historical fiction about slavery and its aftermath, but it was disappointing in that respect-I don't even consider it a satisfying story because the plot was too wierd and everything just seemed so slapped together. I am of the opinion that ghosts should not be put into a story unless the author can do a superb, subtle job of writing them in, such as in Wuthering Heights-or else the story is simply ridiculous. I have a feeling Oprah is inclined to 5-star and promote any book that presents an emotional tie with slavery no matter what kind of slop it is, so I tend not to trust her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritually chilling!","review":"If you have not checked out the movie, GO! This book was exciting to me to see a nice combination of history and supernatural. I was stunned and informed all at the same time. Toni Morrison is in the ranks of Ntozake Shange. I have not read any other author, who has kept my attention as well as amaze me with some good ol' truth. I think for too long writer's have focused on a conventional tales that are beginning to bore. Morrison is definately not boring in any area. If this is your first time reading Morrison get ready to be glued to the book and take time to read more of her books. This book will definitely be etched in your brain when you finish. It will also put your brain into motion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a comment, really","review":"This does not apply to all who gave this book a negative review. Opinions are opinions, and better to be arguing over the merits of a book than drooling in front of the television. What I'm trying to understand is the smug tone of *some* of those who disliked this book. Why do you feel the need to look down on the rest of us? It seems you are trying to justify not liking this book by putting yourselves exactly where you *claim* Morrison is: on a high-horse. Yes I was lost at times, but what a beautiful place to be lost in. Each word was chosen with complete care."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO THANKYOU","review":"Let me start out saying that I love to read. But this book was so difficult to follow. I had a really hard time getting involved with any of the characters or caring about them. I do not want to have to try that hard to find a flow to the words I am reading. I realize a lot of people loved this book, but not me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it! Do I have to give it a star?","review":"I did not like this book at all. It is hard to follow and keep up with. If it were not a required read for a college class I would have never read it. I even considered dropping the class because I didn't want to complete this assignment. There are so many other things to write about. why pain and anger? Why so much disgust. We have read about the disgusting things slaves suffered at the hands of their 'masters' it was horrible but why do we need another book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Indecent","review":"Morrison's word choice is excellent. She's obviously a good writer, but truly, her subject matter leaves A LOT to be desired, in this book. Its raunchy beyond belief. People do things with farm animals that they shouldn't. I couldn't get through the first two chapters without vomiting. Some things you just shouldn't put in your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is trash","review":"I read this in college. Awful and literally disgusting to read. The impact of slavery still resonates with us today, by bringing a ghost into the story it makes it fantasy and I found it impossible to take this book seriously. Toni Morrison is the most overrated author in America, it's only because of Oprah (the most overrated \\"personality\\" in America\\") that she is popular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to close it.","review":"Was enjoying it until Beloved \\"strangled\\" on a raisin. After a stupid part like that I had to stop reading it. I assumed Miss Morrison meant choked, and how can a full grown woman choke on something as small as a raisin? Who chokes on a raisin? Couldn't she have just said it was an olive or somethin?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to follow","review":"This story jumps from current time to past time and narrating person to narrating person so it is confusing. I love books about slavery, civil war but this was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beloved: You People are Sheep","review":"Frankly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Beloved was one of the dullest, most unimaginative books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. OK, life in the South is rough. The black experience is a deeply spiritual thing. Richard Wright said that 40 years ago, as did Zora Neale Hurston. And they said it a lot better than Tony Morrison. Morrison is an overrated author whose success is as much due to Oprah's poor opinions as her own talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beloved - a masterpiece","review":"Beloved, by Toni Morrison, is a shattering book. The ingredients of the story are simple: slavery, a dead baby, broken lives and a broken family. But the lyrical prose and ingenious structure of this tale yields far more than a good novel: it produces a masterful epic that resounds with themes personal and universal, from the haunting of the past to the terror of slavery.Some readers may not digest the way the story is told, and the author certainly makes no allowances. Her writing is similar to her protagonist, Sethe's, situation: either accept, understand, and experience the tale to its fullest, or leave bewildered.Beloved is an extraordinary novel that I strongly recommend anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read","review":"I've read this book for two separate English classes at Williams College now, and it's been a really remarkable experience- I don't want to ruin any of the plot or the characters, but I would really recommend that anyone, particularly those with an interest in the history of slavery, pick this up sometime. It made me cry, but maybe I'm just overemotional..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"I don't know how many times I tried beginning this book. The plot was confusing - I couldn't follow it. But when I really began reading it, turning the pages, it was a feeling more than a plot; I just let the words flow across my mind. Eventually everything came into place. The most amazing thing is Morrison's talent. She can put you, as a reader, in someone else's shoes, whether it's Paul D. or Sethe. I don't care if your ancestors were slaves 100 years ago in America or 1000 years ago in Rome, you will feel what it's like, how dehumanizing, when you read this book. And I'm still wondering if Beloved was truly a spirit or simply Sethe's insanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing...","review":"I was very disappointed with Morrison's \\"Beloved\\". Granted, there were several creative lyrical phrases scattered among the disjointed paragraphs and strange plot lines, but the work as a whole wasn't worth finishing. Read an online summary if you want to, but find something better that isn't a waste of your valuable reading time. It is disturbing when a book is praised falsely. Don't be fooled by the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy Audio version if hard of hearing","review":"I tried to listen to the CD version of this book. Morrison reads it herself. She should have hired a professional. I listen to books in my car. There is road noise. Even with my hearing aids and the volume turned to max I could not understand much of what she was saying -- even when the car was stopped. She talks in this breathless, whispering, trailing off at the end of words sort of way. Those of you with hearing issues know what I am talking about. Get the written version if you want to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What am I missing?","review":"I consider myself very fortunate to have discovered several new authors as well as several excellent books by reading the Oprah Book-of-the-Month club selections; however, I was very disappointed in \\"Beloved\\". The story is hard to follow, slow, and did not contain the history I expected. I got so tired of reading about Sethe's daughter Denver trying to keep Beloved happy, of Paul's confusion as to where to sleep, of Beloved's mood swings...I've read thousands of books in my life, and only twice have I not bothered to finish a novel. \\"Beloved\\" was one of them. My guess is that the symbolic and poetic content of \\"Beloved\\" is over my head, which surprises me immensely. I was disappointed that the story didn't catch my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a load of hype!","review":"Unfortunately, though I gave this book two attempts with a years interval, I still couldn't finish it! I'd heard the hype and was hoping to discover something extraordinary but was totally underwhelmed in the end.There are definately some disturbing images and some quite beautiful prose in this book but it hardly meets the kind of praise it has received.However, a winner of the Nobel prize for literature it is, so give it a go and see for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literature","review":"Along with Song of Solomon, this is Morrison's best book. It is a sophisticated narrative told with zest and poetry, and a deeply experimental, philosophical novel that dares to intervene in history. Morrison hits all the right notes. A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"How the story explains itself thru the chapter's","review":"This is a book of the trials and tribulations of life and struggles a women and her family wen't & goe's thru. Such as loosing loved one's by natural death and murder and the a love tail that develop's as you read the book. Over all Toni Morrison does a good job of keeping your attention questioning your thought's on everyday life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I ever read. Wonderful!!!","review":"If your looking for a book with muliple ideas to connect with then Beloved is for you. It offers a new type of understanding.The Book is much better then the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novel about the pain and heartache of slavery!","review":"Beloved was one of the most riveting books I've ever read. Toni Morrison really grasped what it was like to sacrifice yourself and your children for freedom. Her characters were rich with meaning; with them she was able to conveythe true meaning of pain and anguish. Ms. Morrison is among the greatest to ever pick up the pen. I am proud that she was able to get millions of people to finally understand what happened in the moments when no one was looking. She presented the realism that is Black thought and belief; never before has a more real situation or more real characters been created."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Read it Five Times!","review":"I am an avid, long-time fan of Toni Morrison. Each and every word she has published up until now sits on my bookshelf permanently, except when I take down a book to re-read it. Beloved, like the title, is my first and favorite Morrison. At first read, I found it extremely difficult. Thankfully, a college literature course forced me to read it again. It is an emotional labyrinth that draws you in deeper and deeper, dangerously close to your own psyche. In this one novel, Morrison teaches more about slavery, culture, humanity, and spirituality than any history, sociology or religion course could ever aim to. And if you're not into that stuff, trust me--it's a phenominal, suspensful story, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Cold","review":"Beautiful language, but the story and characters left me cold. I ended up reading it purely to see how Morrison's words would unfold. I think I would have been moved if it had been a book of poems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and Beautiful","review":"This was quite an interesting book. Although I found it to be quite difficult, I found myself connected to the struggle that bestows the characters. How their past greatly scars their future, and how they continue to live with it is remarkable. Going into the mind of an ex-Afican-slave has to be one of the most unbelievable masterpieces in the history of novelsas it is portrayed in Beloved. Toni Morrison is one of the few great novelist of our time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrison doesn't miss on this one!","review":"This book just blew my mind. It tells how life was for slaves and former slaver in the United States. This book will definitely bring up emotions from deep inside the toughest character. This is the story of a family and their past. This is a strong learning experience.Stop what you are doing and read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only read it because I had to","review":"I hated this book. I didn't like the style it was written in at all. I understand why she used a ghost in the story but it doesn't work for me. I felt she was too heavy-handed with the symbolism and it made it hard to empathize with any characters. It wasn't that I didn't understand the \\"complexity\\" of the novel, I just found it annoying to read. If I hadn't been reading it for an English paper I would have set it down and not picked it up again. I'm glad I enjoy reading because overrated books like this could turn a person off for a very long time. It wasn't as boring as The Book of Ruth, but if I were going to recommend any of Morrison's books, I'd say stick with The Bluest Eye or Song of Solomon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrison's Beloved","review":"I am currently an undergraduate at Princeton University where Toni Morrison is a teacher. She is not a very kind person. In any event, this book is overwritten and generally insults my intelligence. I recommend reading Faulkner instead of this plagiarizing trash. Huzzah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Probably the most overrated book in contemporary fiction (though that title might be shared by Midnight's Children). A respectable start than descends into unintelligibility and stays there. I respect Ms. Morrison for what she is attempting to do. The fact that she has failed to do it has not deterred an overabundance of praise on her work. If you must read her, try The Bluest Eye instead. Somewhat better, and shorter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Unreadable","review":"This book is the Emperor's New Clothes of literature. Critics fall all over themselves to praise it for fear of not seeming sufficiently erudite. I think Morrison is secretly laughing at all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only read for AP English","review":"First off I did not like the style it was writen in. It jumped from one thing to another at times and it took a while to realize what she was talking about now. I went into this book believing that it would be a story completely about slavery and what they went through. It ended up being a fantasy type book with slavery thrown into it. The symbolism of the baby ghost did not help me with the whole story. I would have liked it to be more about the slavery aspect than the fantasy with the ghost thrown into the mix. I only read this for my AP English class and I had to force myself through it or else I would not have been able to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good books get the shaft, and THIS gets the prize? COME ON!","review":"how did this book (if you can call it that) get an award? the only award this crap deserves is \\"bob's award for horridly long and annoying literature.\\" this is the biggest pile of hot, steaming trash literature that i've ever read. it's a soap opera set in post-slavery times. it starts normal enough... but then the baby that sethe killed comes back to life as a 1.5-year-old stuck in a 20 year old body. then to give the story another bullcrap turn, she starts screwing sethe's lover, paul d. and somehow she thinks that that's gonna get her closer to sethe. you tell me where this logic plays in. what a lousy story. fans of soap operas will love it; i, for one, thought it was a crappy book with a crappy plot with a few bad acid trips mixed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Repulsive","review":"This book is disgusting and gross and I really wish that the things in this book weren't true. Though this book gives you a clear depiction of what being a slave looks like and what truly happens, it doesn't make it any less depressing and just down right gross. This book will cause your stomach to feel pain and your heart to ache. The agony of this poor women's life is horrible and I would only suggest reading this book if you truly want your heart and mind to hurt and if you want to be brought to tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with the ghosts & goblins!","review":"I'm sorry but, Toni Morrison, this novel is about the occult. Bizarre. Basically, the author combined slavery with halloween. Very sad. Toni, if you had to do it this way, why couldn't the slaves along with the dead baby ghost all get together and free themselves from slavery before President Lincoln did so? Heck, even the X-Files tv show is better in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrison's writing style is less to be desired","review":"This was the first and only book I have attempted to read by Toni Morrison and I really could not get used to her style of writing. Since I could not get past the style, I could not enjoy the book and get past the first couple of chapters. This book may have an \\"amazing\\" story line (if you can get that far); however the choppy dialect was hard to follow and read. Morrison tried to hard to immulate the dialect of that period, but it was more of a hinderance. I did not find this book reaching out and grabbing my attention. Good try though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The banter of the washerwomen","review":"That is the only way I can describe Morrison's style. It is like being down at the creek, listening to the gossip of the washerwomen. There is no linear progression. Rambling and feral. It was frankly just hard to wrap my brain around this plot and, more importantly, the method of its unveiling. Now, before you throw me into the Morrison-hater category, I also read Paradise, and, though some of the same difficulties were present, (many pages were read four or five times trying to figure out what the hell was going on), I enjoyed it and found its theme more liberating. Beloved was simply a downer, wallowing in a depressing past. Paradise better balanced the search for roots with the need for wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly Terrible","review":"I read this book at the suggestion of a brilliant teacher, but was lost from the first page. I would never reccommend this book to anyone, unless they need something to cure their insomnia. This book was the wort book I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"This book was depressing-nothing light about it-the style of writing is different and visual but if you are in it for a story, it is a tough read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beloved - Not!","review":"I purchased this product for my daughter to read for English class. I did not like the book. The writing and story was difficult to follow. It contained graphic innuendo that I found offensive, although the language was clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahahahahahah...poseurs","review":"Think you are smarter than everyone else?Understand the plight of African-Americans more than anyone, because you are open-mined, unlike the conformist masses?Then this book is perfect for you! Now, am I racist? Of course not. Is it that I have a problem with offensive or \\"provocative\\" material...no, I love Amistead. Unfortunately, with a touchy subject such as race issues in America, it's hard to actually critique a book for its content, instead of its message. But if you want to see a real piece of art dealing with slavery, watch Amistead...much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I can't believe someone would actually want to read about some the grotesque & obscene gestures going on throughout the book. I found it not only confusing with the way the author jumped around form event to event, but down right salacious in content & depressing as well. In my opinion reading is suppose to be either an adventure that takes you out of the ordinary life, or informative. This was just down right excess jibber jabber. It was overboard & weird!No thank you... I will not read another book by this author again anytime soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beloved","review":"I think this book was awful and did not deserve a prize of any kind. I wrote the author years ago and told her so. I threw this book in the trash and I read a lot of prize books, and I don't care if she was black or white, the book makes no sense, it is garbage, its like throw in a lot of stuff people don't understand and she is brillant. It seems people don't want to admit they don't understand her for fear of being called stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lackluster Performance","review":"This book was not a total disapointment, it didnt take long to read.Toni has a comon failing among female writers, unfocused ideas and flat characters. the subject matter wasnt something that particlarly intrested me.I guess it would be possible to like this book, but someone like me, I think Ill stick with sci-fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm... I'm not impressed","review":"Well, I don't know what defines 'masterpiece,' but I didn't find anything particularly ingenius about this book. Nothing against the author, but, why does this child come back for Love? How lame... Wouldn't the average murdered child ghost come back for bloody revenge? I'll stick to my Tolkien and Crichton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: This book may cause severe boredom.","review":"BELOVED is poor in its totality. I was forced to read it for an English class. It begins with a poorly developed premise and ends with lose ends still untied. The Immortal Beloved is completely implausible in its historical setting. Morrison made no attempt to create an appropriate premise/setting. BELOVED must have won the Pullizter for political reasons. This book has no depth or content. After finishing it, virtually everyone in my class felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CONTINUATION OF A STORY OF MYSELF","review":"....I used the book as a project for my high school multiculturalproject, and I expcted more out of such a hyped up and widely praised book. There haven't been many books that I've actually enjoyed, and this is definitely a book that I really did not enjoy. I would credit the sucess of this book to Oprah.... The only reason why I gave this book 1 star was that it was so pathetic I actually felt sorry for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was expecting pure magic to flow from every page given all that I'd heard about this book but was really disappointed.

This book is incomprehensible, therefore, that small group that either understands it [or pretends to] struts and preens and deem themselves to be the arbiters of taste for American literature. \\"Beloved\\" is overdone, overused, overwritten, overhyped and is turning a generation of college students into book haters by stuffing this down their throats in English class.

I spent maybe fifteen minutes on just a single page at some points. It's so difficult to read, it's hardly worth it. Morrison likes to say something that makes absolutely no sense, and by the time she gets around to clarifying it you've already forgotten the first incident. It has some interesting things to study for a literature class, but for pleasure reading it's horrible. It took me two months to get through it. It focuses a lot on motherhood and slavery, and as a high school student, I can't relate. Yeah, we've heard just how awful slavery was. I've read other more grotesque descriptions that hit a lot harder than this roundabout way of telling it.

It simply made NO SENSE for me at all. How much ability of clairvoyance and anticipation does Morrison expect? How much can an author expect a reader at all? More, than an intermediate reader like me can take, I'd like to state....Of course, as a Pulitzer winning book, it must have been a feast for critics, but it was an agony for me....There might be readers who are apt to shed light beyond the ever-so-tightly-woven interactions of the characters, but me, as a not-so-profound knower of Morrisons works, her intention to make people think and act doesn't work out, as BELOVED, rather than makes one act, leaves one bedazzled and confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"This work deserves to be in every American's library","review":"The novel Beloved is not a book just about slavery. It is primarily about one's past affecting and influencing the present and possibly the future if it is not dealt with. If one does not make peace with one's past and the decisions that were made then one cannot heal, there can be no hope.

There is always hope if we faint not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Ambiguity","review":"What makes this book so great is the ambiguity at its core.

Like the part where Sethe has to pee, but can't make it to the outhouse. The act of her peeing is very graphically described, but it had no purpose.

Why did you give this disjointed, non-sensical \\"work\\" the most highly regarded prize on earth? Morrison's poor writing is disguised by the fact that she is black and is writing about slavery. If you polled all of the critics who gave this book rave reviews, I bet that you would find that most of them are white. They are embarrased by the crimes of their forefathers and feel that by giving Beloved a good review, they are making up for centuries of oppression.

She was a woman trying to protect her children from a horror which no one should experience. I asked myself\\"would I have made the same decision?\\" You may ask yourself too. I think everyone should give this book a try. I can identify with Sethe, trying to live life by her rules and walking proudly by making a choice that others would be reluctant to do.

Some details in the book made it intersting, ones that have little meanings but to show the way things are. The book did however, made me think about the life a slave lived back then, which i must admit, i never thought about it.

Because you can become lost in the book, at times from different places the story likes to pick up, there's a plenty of flashbacks which cause you to lose track in the story. The characters place a strong appeal to the story, whom draws you into the book. I would recommend this book to someone who has an open mind wouldn't think the phenomna is possible in the book. This book is not to long but it has a strong story.

I must admit I approached it with some trepidation. I thought that Toni Morrison would be difficult to read, too female-oriented or just plain boring.Of course, as with all great writers, she's nothing of the sort! The language is really beautiful and poetic. The characters in this, what amounts to a ghost story, are extremely well developed. Toni builds the story, eaking parts of each character's history out - leaving us guessing, wondering, wanting more information. At first this can make for some difficult reading as it's not entirely clear in the first chapter just what is going on.

The book is 275 pages long but any competent author could have written it in less than 175.

On one page, the first paragraph would be twenty years in the past, and the next paragraph would be five years in the past, and the third paragraph would be in the present. (by present I mean late 1800's).Sometimes even in one paragraph the story would go through several different events over several different years.

I eagerly checked it out of the library - only to be disappointed thoroughly. For the most part, this book was extremely boring and at times hard to understand. It took me several readings to finally get the ending, and even then I was puzzled. To put it bluntly, it was just too weird for my tastes. I certainly don't understand how this book could have possibly won a Nobel. And I certainly hated Sethe, who killed her child to spare her a life of slavery and racism. Don't get me wrong: I am not a racist and I believe that slavery was the darkest point in American society and history. But I can't believe a mother would actually kill her own baby due to slavery.

What terrible agony and depth of emotion and Morrison brings it all to light, slowly and painfully in a stream of consciousness manner.

So I was not too pleased when I found out I would have to read it for another college course a few years later. Well, when I read it the second time, I enjoyed it more. It made more sense, and it was easier to figure out. I think this is one of those books that need multiple readings to get it completely. I also found more meaning in it when I read it looking for human rights violations for a human rights course rather than just reading it for a literature class. This book really is very powerful and gives a very strong message about the long-lasting effects of slavery on the human body and mind. Still, not my favorite.

It shows the injustices and though choices slaves were confronted with everyday. The book makes you thankful for all the blessings you have in your life.

This isn't to say its bad. When you actually know whats going on it is a moving account of American slavery. I think it depends of what kind of reader you are. If when you read books you value the challenge of an author who is providing a text which will infuriate and confound you at times, then you will appreciate this book. On the other hand if you believe (as I do) that the is nothing clever in writing a book that is non-linear to the point of spoiling your enjoyment, then you should stay away unless you have a deep intrest in the subject matter. Saying this on completion the is a perverse pleasure in finishing a book like this and no doubt repeat readings of this book will be more enjoyable as the reader knows whats going on.I'm glad I read it and some of the writing is excellent.

I think it's one of the best novels in the English language. Morrison's style is unequaled, and her voice is too. I would also suggest SONG OF SOLOMON, but she is so talented that you can't tell the same person wrote them both. She is an actress with a pen.

These characteristics made the book more interesting. As I said before I enjoyed the writing but not so much the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insprational novel","review":"From the first page of the book, to the final words, \\"Beloved\\", by Toni Morrison is a book that I found impossible to put down. Once you open the book, and start reading, you are pulled into the lives and times of Sethe, and the other characters in the book. The only parts that I didn't understand were the parts when Beloved,herself was speaking. Being that she was speaking of a different place, a place that noone has been to to explain it, it is understandable to me that those parts were confusing. The best part, in my opinion was the end. I loved the book, but the way that the last chapter was written was what made my opinion soar.

Despite obvious Production Code restrictions, director Anthony Mann has crafted an unusual genre-bending film - marred by a painfully weak finale and the miscasting of Wendell Corey (who, unlike Gilbert Roland, displays zero chemistry with Stanwyck). Victor Milner's Oscar-nominated cinematography is complemented by Franz Waxman's classic score. \\"The Furies\\" represents Mann's most underrated work and a memorable swansong for the great Huston."},{"rating":"1","title":"Healthy Heart One-Dish Meals","review":"In skimming the book through the eyes of someone who just had quadruple bypass surgery I was furious.

I refer to the bra as my bosom harness because of the way that I feel when I'm wearing the bra is the way that I imagine I'd feel if I were harnessed to some piece equipment. Needless to say, the bra isn't very comfortable to wear, but it does hold up my breasts, contains them with no cupcake look, and that's my main concern, because no other bra that I've purchased in the past has been able to accomplish lifting/holding up my breasts. I can't see where the bra minimizes my bosom in fact, my breasts appear jutted out and bigger because they're lifted up so I guess I'll just have to live with that; but all in all, I like the bra, it works, and it is worth the high price that Wacoal charges for it.

She is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"From the other reviews that I have been reading, I disagre. Sure, I admit the movie had a good plot and good characters, but Lazenbe was definatly the wrong choice. If they had chosen someone else, anyone else, this Bond film would have been consitered a great Bond as Dr. No, or Gold Finger. Good ol' George was so bad, and unbilevible as Bond, they would not let him to do another one.(A disision in which I agree!!) The producers also made a bad choice with Timithy Dalton, but that is another review."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Bonds","review":"Great story ruined by the inclusion of Lazenby as the legendary spy. Even worst is the replacement of Donald Pleasance by Telly Savallas as Blofeld. The cold sinister performance of Pleasance is here reduced to the coarse persona of Kojak. This is without a doubt one of the most forgetable Bond actors and films along with Timothy Dalton's horrible last installment, 'License To Kill'."},{"rating":"2","title":"60's Bond at it's best...","review":"It may not be Connery but it's a must-own for even the mildest admirer of Bond films. Lazenby is smooth, quiet, not overly animated, but fits the bill the perfectly in my opinion. The style, music, characters, suspense, romance and action are all of classic 60's spy campiness. And as mentioned in other reviews, the scenery and camera work are excellent.As you will see by watching it, Kojak is also quite the skier, as well as a brilliant mad scientist set on taking over the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's no Sean Connery but...","review":"Lazenby doesn't give off that suave tough guy attitude that Connery does but this in my opinion is still a great movie. It has one of the more original plots (not nuculear warfare), Rigg does a great job as the Bond girl, and OHMSS has by far the best Blofeld. Don't write it off because you like the other Bonds better give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite bond movie","review":"this is my favorite bond movie which is really surprising considering the fact that george lazenby was not at all my idea of james bond--i am a sean connery diehard---but diana rigg as the one and only mrs james bond to be is by far the best bond girl and a very talented actress--also telly savalas another very talented actor takes and gives a great performance as ernst stavro blofeld ---while george lazenby isn/t sean connery he doesn/t do a bad job either--just different--some of the best action scenes of the bond series are in this movie the storyline is also one of the best of the entire bond series"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Bonds","review":"After sitting through the dreadful \\"Live and Let Die\\" last weekend, \\"OHMSS\\" looks better all the time, though it's a bit overlong. I'm grateful that George Lazenby was 007 in this particular effort rather than appearing in subsequent Bond films (which were mostly forgettable except for Connery's return in \\"Never Say Never Again\\"). In fact, the series should have ended after the Lazenby film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best that ever was...............","review":"My favorite of all the Bond films.Truly an epic number.Lazenby is good,and the rest of the cast is superb.The best score of the series and the best photo.Wonderful locations and all that stuff.Look at it and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated but in my opinion its in the top 5 bonds","review":"you know what some thing are easier to show than tell so i urge you to watch this bond movie most people assume its bad because george lazenby did one bond movie but if you go in expecting a poor 007 movie your going to be dissapointed you need to watch it with a clear mind dont bother with any preconcieved notions just watch like its the first bond youve ever seen you'll be surprised"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most underrated Bond movie of them all","review":"After having watched this for the second time recently, I really started to appreciate how good George Lazenby was as James Bond. If he was given more movies, I think it would be a fair arguement to say that he could have been better than Connery. Not only is this movie really entertaining, but it also is quite dramatic, and not nearly as cheesy as most Bond movies are. Definately one of my favorites in the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"On Her Magesty's Secret Service was a spectacular bond film. George Lazenby is an awesome actor. The DVD quality is great, the extras are entertaining, and it's the most emotion you'll get from a bond film. The end left me in tears, and I'm not one of those people who cries during movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"What was the point?","review":"Lazenby played the part of Bond very well. The lame part of this movie is that you can tell that they are really pushing multiculturalism probably to make it fit with the new Bond (a brown British?). Lazenby was only in one Bond film, so what really was the point if you are not going to be in it for the long haul? They just made a bad choice as to what actor was going to be Bond."},{"rating":"2","title":"A","review":"if Connery was in it then it would have been the only +.

They should have kept George Lazenby for a couple more movies in my opinion. The special effects are great (finally). This had one of the most strongest plots of any Bond (with him getting married and all). The was sort of sad (I don't cry when I watch movies, like u needed to know that) when his wife (of about 20 minutes) got killed by Blofeld's gunman."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite James Bond film","review":"George Lazenby is my third favorite Bond behind Sean Connery and Daniel Craig. This is a great film with good action and a touch more drama and romance than the other films. The setting is spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good?! You call this good?!","review":"Many consider this movie the best in the series. Of these people, how many bothered to watch the film? OHMSS is painful to watch. It takes over an hour for anything to happen. George Lazenby is not bad in his only Bond appearance, but he can't save a terrible movie. Blofeld has built a research center in the Alps. I won't reveal the plot, but then again, it's almost not worth writing. Telly Savales as Blofeld is by far the worst. He's just not menacing. George Lazenby is the worst Bond. If you want to see a good Bond, watch any Roger Moore film, the best being The Spy who Loved Me, which also happens to be the best in the series, followed closely by Goldfinger. All in all, OHMSS is hardly worth the time it takes to watch it, although the music is quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazenby, You're No Sean Connery","review":"The last Bond movie I saw. I'd seen the others, most of them years ago and many when they first came out. Then I saw this.....this.....this....whatever it is. It was terrible, absolutely terrible.For starters, George Lazenby is just not Sean Connery - even 40 years later, he's not Sean Connery. The movie features a number of one-liners that misfire, a barely discernible plot, a lousy Bond, a decent car, and the one bright moment: Telly \\"Kojak\\" Savalas as Blofeld. The tough guy tries to off Bond and - to point out another monstrosity of this movie - there are WAY too many snow skiing scenes, including the last one where Blofeld is caught on the limbs of an overhanging tree while competing against Jamaica in the bobsled event.This movie was - bar none - the WORST Bond ever made. I don't know that one could be made that is worse. Seriously. Although they certainly tried it the very next go around."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Should at Least See the Ending","review":"Pretty much bored until the end. It surprised me. The whole sequence of the marriage and then the after effect was very well done. It pulled at my heart-strings."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"And I thought Moonreaker was bad. God. Geroge Lazenby sucks. He's a disgrace to the Bond films. Sean Connery would have made this movie a thousand times bettter.Second, I never really got the plot. Blofeld is pretending to work at an allergy clinic? That's just plain stupid. Blofeld's actor was horrible too. The plot really never picked up until the end. The ski chase was cool. The bobsled thing was cool too, but Blofeld won't die.The girls were ugly too. And I keep wanting Blofeld to act like Dr. Evil.I'm starting to read the book. Frankly, I'd rather watch a movie than read a book. But, this is just a disgrace to Ian Fleming. Good thing he didn't live to see this. He would have died after he watched it anyway.The bottom line is: This movie is the worst Bond film. Avoid it. Try watching something like Goldeneye or Goldfinger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never mind \\"worst James Bond movie ever\\"......","review":"...worst JAMES BOND ever is more like it!

It's so bad, it makes Dunes look like a good movie. George Lazenby is untastefuly casted to play James Bond. The fact that he didn't seem to be British was bad enough, but the way he was written made it even worse. If you are a true James Bond fan, you wont like this one. stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"at least Michael Moore is not in it!!!","review":"Okay I am 007's #1 fan and I LOVE every one but this is my least favorite and we all know the top 6 best Bond movies are: #1 For Your Eyes Only #2 Licence To Kill #3 The Man with the Golden Gun # 4 Live and Let Die #5 Goldfinger #6 From Russia with Love. The 4 best Bond actors are Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Sean Connery, and Pierce Brosnan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bond-film ever made!","review":"This film is an underrated masterpiece!Lazenby is no Moore or Connery,but he comes across extremely well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Connery, But It Works","review":"This has to be one of the best Bond films ever made, which in a way is very surprising due to a few details in the movie. One, and this is very important, this is the first movie in the series without the great Sean Connery as the star! Sean Connery is by far the best man to take on the role of Bond, so most would kind of judge a little hard on the man who took his place. But somhow Lasenby pulled it off.This movie has somthing for fans of later movies such as For Your Eyes Only, and Licence to Kill, because this is the movie where Bond found the woman that he marries, and also where Blofeld hits Bond with an enourmous blow.So if you want the best story, some of the best pick up scenes with Bond and the ladies, and if you were a fan of the Avengers TV show, (Bonds wife was a cast member) then this is the movie for you. NUFF SAID."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've actually read the books...","review":"... you'll know that this is far and away the most accurate portrayal of the Bond character that Ian Felming created and described. Lazneby's performance is at the same time both understated and accurate, and Diana Rigg is just as perfectly cast and beautifully played as she had been in The Avengers. If you like the campy crap in the later Moore films, or you just want the over-the-top action of the Brosnan films, then perhaps look elsewhere, but if you want to see James Bond personified, this is the place to be..."},{"rating":"2","title":"my movie","review":"the movie was just like it was supposed to be, and it arrived when it said it would be here.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Bond","review":"A little hokey in places but that's the point. Classic 60's Bond. It's unfortunate that George Lazanby wasn't given the opportunity to continue in the role after Sean Connery's brief return. George was much more believable as Bond than Roger Moore ever was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect except for one thing...","review":"Lazenby is awful. His imitation of Sean Connery just doesn't work. He's like a cardboard cut out being pushed through the movie. He is neither suave or dangerous His vapid grin annoys and his eyes betray that as an actor he didn't have any idea how to create an inner life for his character. I believe folks who rate this one highly are being too kind, reaching for what it might have been with a better Bond. Even Roger would have been an improvement.If you want a better more serious Bond go see Skyfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best James Bond movie?","review":"That George Lazenby didn't want to be Bond in the midst of the hippie era--well, who could blame him? The pity is that he wasn't as bad as everyone said--and he starred in the one Bond movie that could have awakened Sean Connery's slumbering interest in Our Hero. This movie duels with Goldfinger as the best of the Bond films--it has a cosmic plot, faithful to Flemings' original; supposedly director Peter Hunt glued pages of the book to the script, or so he claimed. It has Diana Rigg and a classic ski chase, and a magnificent villain's lair in the Swiss alps. John Barry's score is the most dramatic in the series...I've always considered this one of the most cinematically beautiful films I've seen and I can't wait to see the DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good effort for the 1 timer Bond","review":"I read reviews about this for along time. and 2day i finally got my copy and watched it.

OHMSS is very good, very long, and most interesting. To anyone whos a BOND fan like me, just watch it, like it or not, just watch it. To me its awesome, sad, funny one liners, good bond, GOOD bond girl ( one of the best ) and amazing locations as well as that ski chase. 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Bond film I've seen (sad but true)","review":"After growing up on the Bond films I decided recently to rewatch the series on DVD, especially in light of the bonus materials available. I just watch \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" last night and I can't believe some of you think so highly of it. By far it had the worst acting, the worst camera work, the worst editing, the worst writing, the worst stunts, the cheapest-looking sets, and one of the the most boring plots of any Bond movie I've seen so far (I've rewatched about 3/4 of them). Lazenby was completely unbelievable as Bond to the point where, in combination with all the other factors I just mentioned, I almost turned the movie off after the first 30 minutes. In short, watching this movie is like being forced to eat a rubbery burger at a fine steak house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good story but RIUNED by Lazenby","review":"All in all it was an alright story line. It might have been in my top 10 if it was connery, moore,brosnan or mabe even dalton. I am sorry but lazenby should stick to modeling. He riuned this film for me. He couln't pull off the role. Models just cant act smart or cunning i guess. It not a good movie probably worst one in whole colection. THeir are facts to prove this too such as the fact that OHMSS barely made a profit and by far grossed the least amount of money.Over all not a good movie my ranking of bonds hast to go.1. Connery (Great bond absolutly fantastic,great in every movie)2. brosnan (Very good bond, although it was obvious that he was not used to and very nervous about the role in Goldeneye)3.

I thought the Bond character was supposedly a loner. In my opinion, this film should have never been made. Has anyone seen \\"The James Bond Story\\"? Even Lazenby says he hates the film.

One more bad thing is that this is the longest bond film. It about 2hours and 22minutes. Also the Film just kinda dragged on too. If you want to wacth airhead lazenby ruin a great movie,GO AHEAD.

The only trouble I had with it was Lazenby's wooden dialog. George seemed to be reading his lines from a teleprompter. I liked George, he had the looks, the style to be the pefect Bond, just the delivery stunk. The story is first rate, top notch. Diana Rigg (thumpa thumpa thumpa ) is still my #1 Bond girl after Aki (YOLT). Savalas was the perfect Blofeld, and Irma Bunt was chilling. Plot, script and scenery was perfect. I hate to say this but Lazenby's dialog seemed about as emotional as Stephen Hawkings computerized voice, devoid of inflection. Other than that, there is much to love about this movie, even the plot is relevant to today. Bioterrorism may be the horror scenario of the new millenium. Perhaps a remake of OHMSS would be in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fleming's 007","review":"It should come as no surprise that Amazon hasn't even entered this title correctly in it's database. As of March 21, 2009 it shows up as \\"on Her Majesty's Secret\\". The newest Daniel Criag 007 film is set to debut on March 24, 2009, but more importantly \\"on Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" is set to debut on the same date as a single only disc and I'm assuming it will be in the frame by frame digital restoration version that previously could only be purchased as part of a set. It was author Fleming's best novel and the film follows it very closely. This movie remains the most accomplished in the series, and the scenes in the Swiss snow backed by John Barry's pulse pounding score are a glory to behold."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Mr. Bond","review":"When I was growing up in the 80's I was told that the worst James Bond movie ever was OHMSS with George Lazenby, so I always thought so. When i finally saw the movie I realized it was one of the best. George Lazenby was the ideal model for Bond. He did a great job period. He was never given a fair shot at the position.Telly Savalas was Blofeld. All Blofelds before and after were weak next to him. He was smart, scary, and active. He did not just give orders, he was part of the chase, a true villian.Diana Rigg was not a Bond Girl, she was a true heroine. She was smart, sexy and her own woman. The chemistry between Lazenby and Rigg was there on screen.The soundtrack is what makes this movie. When you hear the music when Bond is being chased you feel as if you are there. This is one of the best Bond soundtracks.Sean Connery is best Bond because of the body of his work. Maybe Bond would not have turned into camp with DAF and the Roger Moore Bonds if Lazenby had stayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Finally, a slowcooker cookbook with recipes that sound GOOD! I have been valiently trying to find some recipes that appeal to me(and yes i tried the Rick Rodgers book -- those recipes required way too much work) and this book has 'em! I agree with the reviewer before me that there are too many duck recipes, but every cookbook has plenty of things to skip over. This book has carmelized onions and ideas for using them, baked garlic, again with ideas for using it, hummus, several recipes for dried beans & lentils, risotto,scallops, lamb, and stocks in addition to stews, brisket, and deserts. It works for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly disappointed","review":"I've made 3 or 4 recipes from this book now - the only one that turned out was the caramelized onions, which were wonderful, but how could one screw that up? I had thought that perhaps my idea of what tastes good was just different from the author's, but after reading some of the other reviews here I see it's not just me.My expectations aren't usually all that high for crock-pot books, but Lora Brody has such a good reputation that I was expecting more than usual. I even tried one recipe twice thinking I must have made a mistake - it was worse the second time. Oh well.I was disappointed enough to be inspired to write my first-ever Amazon book review. I guess that's something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UNTESTED DISASTER?","review":"I just threw out an entire 6-qt recipe for New England Boiled Dinner. I followed the recipe exactly, although I had an uneasy feeling about her instructions to cook this corned beef dish for 12-16 hours on high heat. My suspicions were born out as the recipe absolutely destroyed the meal I had planned for tonight. I cooked it overnight or I might have realized it was done way before 12 hours. When I woke up to an entire house full of the stench of food verging on burnt I knew immediately. I looked at the recipe again to be sure I hadn't mis-read her instructions. Twice in the recipe she says to cook for 12-16 hours on high. Use this book at your own peril. I have other books by Lora Brody and have never had a problem, but this one must have not been checked for timing. Who knows what else might be wrong with the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer be warned","review":"i collect cookbooks and do a lot of experimenting with recipes. every dish i've made from this book has had a strange, unappetizing flavor. i've just ruined a $30 piece of lamb, so i don't plan to cook from this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is great","review":"This book gives elegant and just \\"real food\\" to cook in the crockpot.

If you're looking for a cookbook to make your life easier with \\"everyday\\" type foods, this is NOT it. However, if you eat rabbit, duck or lamb on a regular basis, you will love this cookbook. There were only a few recipes that included foods such as a beef roast and chicken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atomic Rooster - 'Rarities' (Angel Air)","review":"Very well assembled collection of unreleased tunes that's been pulled from Rooster guitarist / vocalist's John DuCann's private stash. Can't complain. It's a pretty decent nineteen track disc that surely holds my complete interest,to say the least. Best songs are the rocking \\"Death Walks Behind You\\", the alternative mix of \\"Throw Your Life Away\\", \\"Devil's Answer\\", the demo of \\"Don't Lose Your Mind\\",\\"Forward Revealed\\", the in-your-teeth \\"End Of The Day\\", and one of my personal Rooster favorites \\"I Can't Take No More\\". Also liked the radio friendly \\"No Changes By Me\\". There are a couple of U.S. radio ads mixed in. Very cool! Why don't more artists tag radio ads on their later day compilation CD's? Vince Crane's killer keyboard work is nearly worth the admission price alone. 'Rarities' is a good effort of top grade UK heavy progressive rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"smells like soap, not rain.","review":"not at all what i expected. maybe the ones with the blue tips would be more what i'm looking for. these are not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"wrong order fixed - fast and free!!!","review":"The wrong item was sent.

The book is well thought out and clear. It is like a guided meditation exercise except that the reader becomes involved through the writing. It's well paced, so that the reader/writer does not become overwhelmed for it will elicit memories and strong feelings. The fact that the setting is akin to a dream, makes it easier to bring out and work through issues, mostly related to others in our life. I loved this book and do still. I've gone back to re-read some of my earlier passages and found the visions of my future (written some twenty years ago) quite accurate. I wish it was still available new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Descover yourself","review":"This book is a wonderful tool for self discovery and self actualization. Not only will you know yourself better after working through the journey that the book will take you on, but you should also find yourself much more aware of obsticals, challenges, and relationships that may or may not need work on.

The style is one of question and answer, first the illuminating insights of Krishnamurti followed by the in depth questioning of Bohm. At times one gets lost in the concepts Krishnamurti uses to expand on his views but in the nick of time Bohm clarifies the issue with his well known brand of questioning. It is indeed rare to find such a book which so deeply investigates the subtlety of thought, its construction of the \`self' and its uses and abuses so to speak. As typical of Krishnamurti and Bohm this book is important and lacks any kind of fantasy component or unecessary terms. Perfect for psychologists, scienists and laymen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, sort of","review":"This debut LP from Penetration is hard to pin down. It has punk elements (evidenced by covers of the Buzzcocks' \\"Nostalgia\\" and Patti Smith's \\"Free Money), but had a sound closer to new wave. The songs are consistently strong, but rarely as brilliant as the best groups they emulate. The band avoids cliches of romantic, commercial rock, but the lyrics have never been particularly strong or innovative.MOVING TARGETS doesn't exactly capture the band's live electricity, but is a competent rendering of the Penetration at their most creative and consistent. The vocals of Pauline Murray solidify and give distinction to the sound. Best of all, you can still listen to these songs long after other bands have become passe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very well written or helpful","review":"This book confronts the reality that a difficult childbirth can impact a woman but it fails to help in any other way. The author focuses too much on the specifics of the difficult births featured in the book without doing a good job of looking at the bigger goal of helping any woman who had a difficult childbirth overcome the experience. I found it too hard to relate to the women featured - everyone's experience is different, even traumatic experiences. A better approach would be to take the focus off personal stories as anyone reading this book likely has replayed her own traumatic experience over and over and is seeking to overcome it rather than read a play by play of yet another bad time giving birth. I think a book about common reactions to a difficult delivery (such as anxiety) and how to deal with them would be more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"EBC Brakes for the Yamaha","review":"Best prices on the internet, fast quick shipping, product arrived just a couple days after ordering.

I read \\"The Mermaids Singing\\" and was enthralled, but this one was a big disappointment. The plot involving the serial killer is shallow and seems tacked on. The real plot involves Carol, her relationship with Tony, and a sting operation that is completely unbelievable. The ending is a depressing let-down. Overall, the book is a big mess. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted","review":"I listened to this audio book becuase it was lying around. It wasn't inspiring or enlightening. Too many characters and plot twists leave the reader wondering who is who and what is going on. It would have been more interesting if it was real. As one who hasn't read any other books by the author, my viewpoint stands in a vacuum. The ending seems trite and fumbles for closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Temptation by Val McDermid","review":"It must have been the wrong choice of Val McDermid's work.

After about the first chapter I wondered if it would get any better. It didn't. Half way through I wanted to give up, but things were just starting to move, so I didn't.I couldn't get past the fact that it all was so contrived, with the profiler magically pulling predictions about the criminal out of thin air. Definitely not worth the read. If you find that you're not really believing the characters after the first chapter or two, bail out. Read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible choice for reader","review":"The book is by a British woman, the characters are mainly British, and yet the publishers chose an American man to read it!

Guess I'll have to get a paper copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far-fetched. . .","review":"The book had a far-fetched premise, but once I was able to move past that detail, the book was readable, albeit unrealistic.Without giving away anything significant, I can tell you that a major portion of the book was centered around a police officer assuming an alias. Unfortunately, I was a little surprised, and very disappointed in the way the author chose to \\"reveal\\" the main undercover operation to the criminal. The unraveling of the cover was brought about by a mistake that I found completely innane. I could not believe that a rookie, much less a seasoned officer would slip up as the author has Carol (and Tony) slip up. This disbelief is compounded by the lengths that are taken initially to insure that the operation is not comprimised.I was disappointed enough in the book to move along to another author, as opposed to reading the rest of the Carol Jordan/Tony Hill saga. I thought the writing skills of the author were good, but the storytelling skills were not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typomania","review":"Whatever you do don't buy this book on Kindle.

His first movie (Acción Mutante) was a great success in Spain, but his second one is much better.

I recommend rent, or buy, this picture in his original version, with subtitles in english.

These two skills are so underestimated in much of the parenting literature and even the child psychology literature for professionals.

It seems to be a nice quality case with just a couple of issues. The hinge was loose on one of the cases, which was no big deal. My husband fixed it fairly easily. The other issue was that there is no liner in them, and since this is a larger case than a standard jewelry showcase, the velvet inserts that are on Amazon are too small. I considered buying velvet and making my own liner, but I ended up using a cloth carpet material, cutting it to fit, and using glue to secure it to the bottom. It doesn't look all that great, and it would be better if they offered a velvet insert on Amazon to buy with this case. It is neat though that it is actually two cases in one, and I like that it secures with a lock."},{"rating":"2","title":"More For The Season","review":"Get more for your money as well as more for the Season with this purchase.

I also found their analogies section and sentence completion section very helpful -- the 4 types of bridges idea for an analogy was next to revolutionary for me. Also learning that the answer choices for an analogy have to match the same order as the words in the analogy. I lived 27 years and NEVER knew that, I don't know how many times I've gotten questions wrong from having the correct relationship there but the answer words in the wrong order.The other sections I didn't find too helpful, the reading comp.

The 30yr warranty is a great deal - make sure to keep your warranty card or receipt. The calibration is easy and you get two 50.0g weights. Mine weighed .02 grams away from the actual 50g (.04 when weighing both weights) after calibration. This is miniscule though.

Hearing about other songs he's written for other artists made me crazy waiting for this release. When I first listened In My Own Words I was not disappointed because I thought every song was on point in every aspect especially the production. The limited guest appearances is what I love most about this and especially since it's his first, I can't stand when a new artist has a bunch of tracks with a bunch of other artists on it. His lyrics are different and he sings about things guys are always thinking but never sing about like the single When You're Mad. I think the only flaw in Ne-Yo's debut is that radio stations are playing his music way too much because it's really starting to make me hate this album. All in all this is a killer debut and with Ne-Yo's multitalented mind he's going be able to stick around for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Ain't Gotta Tell you that...this is EXCELLENT!","review":"My, my, my,...this young man has restored my belief that R&B; is alive and well!

I like his originality and the tributes in sampling older R&B hits like Switch's \\"I Call Your Name\\". All the riff raff R&B artists out there like Omarion, B2K, Marques Huston and Chris Brown you got work to do. Ne Yo is on the scene and he came fierce!! Trey Songz and Mario to me rank up there with him because of they have a flavor that compliments old school R&B and thats the sound that we want to bring back.

I will say his voice is not as advanced as his songwriting but he does stay on key unlike some of the new guys (Chris Brown)I think its a strong debut but he will need a great 2nd single to stick around. But in the end he will be ok because not only is writing songs for more than half of the r&b; community, he wrote all the songs on this disc too. Give him his credit.

The beats to the songs were tight. My favorites were \\"So Sick\\" and \\"When You're Mad\\". Overall this was a good CD, the music was great. I'm sure he's not trying to be like Usher.

I love his smooth voice it's so sexy and reminds me of early 80's michael jackson. He truly has a gift for writing great melodies and sophisticated words and shows it all off on this record. I just get chills at the beginning of each song when there is a piano and a percussion instrument like I have not gotten from any other artist in so many years.

He's got a slew of other easy to listen to jams, and brings back flashes of Stevie and Marvin.

In My Own Words hits all the notes for a great first album."},{"rating":"2","title":"In His Words","review":"Ne-Yo is not new to R&B; scene as evident in countless biographies and interviews. He co-wrote Mario's monster hit, \\"Let Me Love You\\". Ne-Yo's foray into songwriter turned R&B; star finds him competing with the likes of Chris Brown, Trey Songz, and Mario. The difference here is that Ne-Yo writes all his songs. His style of songwriting really makes him special. On the first single, \\"Stay\\" which may seem like it's about a relationship is about \\"music\\". On \\"So Sick\\" Ne-Yo calls out to a wayward lover who has since moved on. Ne-Yo has a knack for creating catchy pop melodies, but doesn't abandon his smooth R&B; sound. Songs like \\"Sexy Love\\", \\"When You're Mad\\", and the aforementioned \\"So Sick\\" are all ready for Pop radio saturation. All-in-all Ne-Yo has a bright future ahead of him.My personal highlights include:StaySexy LoveSign Me UpIt Just Ain't RightLet Go"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ne-Yo- In My Own Words","review":"The best R&B cd I've heard in a while.

He mixes a bit of 90's R&B with todays sound and it comes out sounding great. But the real catch on the album its is lyrics with original songs and topics you never really hear about when it comes to relationships. My favorites on the album are Stay, When You're Mad, It Just Aint Right, and Sexy Love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Cd","review":"the cd was a nice cd overall. the song let go really hits the point and mirror is just such a nice love song. i really liked this cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent debut.

This is his own singing debut cd, but he has writen for so many great artists like Mario to name one.Obviously I love So Sick (not on our radio stations in Australia but I know the song back to front and inside out) and the other song I absolutely love is When Your Mad. There are lots of great sounds coming from the music - such as violin in Time and the harp in Sexy Love. That is a great song. Time is a great song too and it's kind of sad - about realising mistakes when it's too late. Whilst I LOVE sexy bedroom songs, Mirror would be the worst on here (about making love in front of the mirror) but I found this song boring. The only bad song on a terrific debut cd.We know he has the writing skills, and with a voice like this, he's going to go a long long way.

Tanner goes to Burma and stirs up the county's regime. Here he meets a beautiful Russian/French/Vietnamese woman who travels with him. The story is an interesting quick read but the characters are not as sold as we meet in the Matt Scudder series or Block's books about Bernie Rhodenbarr. I enjoyed it and will search out the other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant romp...even with no real plot...","review":"This is my first Evan Tanner story, but it won't be my last....so what that the book ambled around? The REAL story here was Evan's return to the world after 25 years on ice!I like this hero and am anxious to read more about him. His sharp mind (that needs no sleep) fascinates me; his thirst for knowledge intrigues me; and his ear for languages makes me envious.Think early Ludlum with a lilt....I enjoyed the ride and will take more with Mr. Tanner."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potboiler","review":"I wanted to cry\\"shame.\\" The Scudder and Rhodenbarr series have spoiled me but with the expecations they raise this contrivance with its easy political jokes and hoary gag-lines that have been on ice longer than Tanner is just not worthy of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"ice thaws after awhile ...","review":"i was surprised to say the least, when i was reading and read the part where Block leds you to see how Tanner's been out-of-touch with the world. Block has a very unique way of writing that has often been imitated, but never equaled let alone surpassed.I have to say I'm a huge fan of Block and like almost all of his work (havent read it all yet lol). While I was very impressed with The Thief Who Couldn't Sleep - one of Block's best i think, i feel that this sequel of sorts is lacking a little as far as atmosphere goes, but then again its not the same story, its very different.Even Tanner is a fairly deep character (not quite as much as Block's other protagonists such as Keller or Rodenbarr). Also there's that sense of humor that Block can always pull off with a dry wit - makes me chuckle to myself everytime.While the general plotline is sorta ridiculous, Block pulls it off - and it takes a great writer to make a bad storyline sound good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever the 5-star reviewers are smoking, I want some","review":"This was given to me as a Christmas present.

If you take away all the pointless dialogue and the self-indulgent musings, you're left with a trite plot and a bunch of self-parodying characters. There's plenty of really good Florida fiction out there without having to waste time on marginal, not-ready-for-prime-time writers.Mr. Allison would be well advised to keep the day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author shows promise, however, work is a little pretentious.","review":"Now that Dan Allison has his first novel out of his system, it will be interesting to see what he comes up with next.

Albeit, a little more planning in the area of overall plot would be in order.

The album is propelled by the big hit \\"Smuggler's Blues\\" which is a great tale of drug dealers down in Florida. It's inventive video got major airplay on MTV and was the basis for a guest-starring role for Mr. Frey on Miami Vice. The album is more than just a one-hit affair. The title track is an ode to partying, \\"Sexy Girl\\" is a mid-tempo number that has a \\"New Kid In Town\\" flavor and \\"Better In The USA\\" is in the vein of a Chuck Berry number. Overall, this album shows Mr. Frey's ability to write a good hook and make listener-friendly music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I NEVER GOT IT SEND LETTER BUT NEVER GOT ANSWER BACK I WISH I HAD IT","review":"NEVER GOT IT SO I GUESS IT'S NOT GOOD IF YOU SEND IT TO ME I GUESS I'D LIKE IT BUT I NEVER GOT IT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You, Chuck!","review":"No one has impacted me more in the early years of my ministry like Chuck Swindoll.

Dahood does work deeply into Semetic philology, and while this may bog down the non-academics, he offers an incredible wealth of wisdom from this perspective. Often I was simply struck by the depth of his variant translations and readings of individual Psalms. For me, this is a strong resource to use along side of many other quality texts as mentioned by Olaf01. Dahood's takes some great risks opening himself up for brilliance or criticism. Either way, it makes for exciting and insightful comparisons among the other seminal texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst customer servive!","review":"I bought the Creative Zen Touch 20 GB MP3 Player for my daughter as a Christmas present. It worked fine until the screen developed a big black spot right in the middle of it. It looks like it's burned. I called technical support (405-742-6622) and had to wait for about 20 minutes before someone finally answered. This clown told me I had to pay them $10 for tech support. I told him I just wanted an RMA# so I could return it, I didn't need to go through any nonsense. He told me my 1 year warranty wasn't going to cover replacing a defective screen and that I had to return it with $25 and that the repair department would probably charge me $100 to replace it. These guys suck! This is a $200 MP3 player that's going to cost $100 to fix a defective part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product - awful customer service","review":"The player worked great for about a year and a half, then I decided to update the firmware from Creative's website so that the player was compatible with WMP. The player froze up during the update and is now stuck in recovery mode. I am an intermediate computer user and have tried all of the self-help on Creative's support site to no avail. Creative will not even provide email tech support now that the warranty is period is expired. They want $25 to issue an RMA for repair ... the least expensive repair is more than the price of a new identical player. I will never buy another Creative product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good player, but cheap","review":"The interface is nice, sound is good, and it stores a lot of music. However, after having this player for about 6 months the volume stopped being adjustable (the cheap volume buttons on the side somehow broke internally and now it's useless). Since the warranty on this thing is no-where close to apple's, there was nothing I could do to fix it. So, after wasting a few hundred bucks I bought an ipod and am now happy. Since the volume and controls are all on one wheel, I don't have to worry about 5 different buttons breaking. Plus the warranty for the ipod starts at 1 year (compared to Creative's 3 month warranty), so I won't have to worry about it breaking in 6 months again. Sorry Creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have an existing large mp3 collection, DO NOT BUY!","review":"Wonderous Creative Inc fails to notify buyers of the Creative Zen Touch 40GB that all files in your music library get copied to ONE single ROOT directory on the player (Read: No Subdirectory functionality whatsoever). The only way to sort your new glorious one directory jukebox is by id3 tags. For those of us who have been using mp3s since the internet was born, we made a habit of deleting id3 tags because they were RARELY uniform accross the CDDB. Sometimes they seemed like they were written by people who could only type with a rubber mallet in one hand and a basketball in the other. Or they would classify Bach under grunge.Lessons learned: Id3 tags are as only as good as their authors, and any kind of naming/classifying standards for music have yet to be developed.Oh yea, and the touch pad pretty much eliminates any kind of in car usage."},{"rating":"1","title":"cancelled order","review":"I cancelled this purchase before it was shipped, because the Creative MP3 players are not compatible with Audible (my source for audio book downloads)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought a zen touch for my sons birthday. he hasnt used it very much, but the buttons on the front have stopped working. it is just within the warranty.There is NO 1-800 customer support line.

I returned it for a different player and am satisfied with the second player so far. My only problem with the Zen player is that you cannot create files to store different types of music or certain albums, but I guess you can overcome that issue by playing music according to artist, genre, etc... Also, I'm still waiting for my refund from e-parts and more for having to ship out my broken player. It hasn't come yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep all your music with you!","review":"I bought one of these after making extensive comparisons with other players. I didn't want video so I chose this older model. The sound quality is very good with some separately purchased earphones (the ones in the box are okay but not great). The battery life is amazing. I'm not sure if it gets 24 hours but I use it every day all week and I often don't charge it before going back to work again on Monday. I only have two complaints, this player is heavy, but that is to be expected with such a long-lived battery, and that when I am accessing a large playlist the player can take a very long time to respond. Also I find the random button on the front a bit silly, I listen to a lot of different styles of music and hearing opera followed by pop music just doesn't work for me. That said, this is a great player and when the time comes to get a new one I will buy another product from Creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many breakdowns","review":"I enjoyed my Creative Zen Touch when it was working.

A couple of years ago I bought a Nomad3, its round shape caused a lot of slipping and falling to the ground. Eventually I had to send it back to Creative to get fixed. An eighty dollar service charge was too much so they sent it back and I managed to fix the unit by dropping it again. Nervous, I sold it to a buddy (it's still working) and bought a Dell DJ15 GB. Made by Creative the unit it self was great but the software (MusicMatch) was very buggy. After discovering AllofMP3.com I ran out of room. So I went back to Creative and loved the new software. Nice unit, very clean looking. The software supports dual players at the same time so it is very easy to swap songs through a PC. Nice feature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better design, but locks up all the time.....","review":"Had a Zen xtra 40gb player that was great except for the toggle switch. The Zen Touch fixed this with the touch scroller, but it is a little hard to get a handle on. Sound was great using 3rd party earbud headphones or when connected to another stereo. Industrial design/build/feel of the unit is greatly improved over previous versions.Skip using the included software and just use Media Player 10 for free - works much better for organizing music and keeps all the same details on the player as well - cataloging, file extensions, etc.The BIG problem with mine and my neighbor's 20gb Zen Touch is that it constantly locks up while playing.

The language is simple and precise, and the book is divided into easily indexed sections. Another priceless feature is that the book includes examples. These examples show the reader exactly what it is trying to get across. It shows good examples as well as bad ones to let the reader contrast the two different styles.

Credibility is established within the text. The paragraph style of the book helps students grasp concepts to be able to apply them in their own work.

However, I figure you buy the CD for the musice and not the packaging. I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazingly outstanding!","review":"The music is fabulous.

Everyone claps after Jennifer Hudsons performace of And I Am Telling You Im Not Going. Anyway i dont own either copy of this officially, but have downloaded songs from it. I do notice that some of the songs are sung differently on this single version and the deluxe. Example on the Deluxe 2 cd set the song Hard To Say Goodbye My Love is the version from the movie where Beyonce is singing lead. The version on this single soundtrack its not Beyonce singing lead, its someone else. So some of the songs are different. Since i dont own either cd im not sure what other"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not living up to the hype.","review":"I will probably get shot for saying this. But Jennifer Hudson is NO Jennifer Holiday. She my have a strong voice, but it's not Holiday strong (not to mention as skilled) If you want to hear these songs at their best, get the Broadway soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamgirls","review":"I really enjoy some of the songs on this CD. I do have to say that it is kind of a let down to listen to the CD after seeing the movie in the theatre. Seeing the emotion on the singers face really adds to the dynamic of the songs when you're watching the movie. I cried during almost every song when I saw Dreamgirls at the theatre, but not as much listening to it on CD. It is an excellent movie with a great soundtrack. It is very inspiring and a lot of hard work went into it obviously, I'll give 'em that. Kudos to Jennifer Hudson! She really belts 'em out."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD TO HAVE","review":"I SHOULD SAY THAT IT'S A GREAT CD FOR THOSE WHO LOVE DREAMGIRLS. ALTHOUGH THE BEST IS THE CONCERT VERSION OF DREAMGIRLS WITH LILIAS WHITE, AUDRA MCDONALD IN THE CAST.EDDIE MURPHY SURPRISED ME, HE DID A GREAT JOB. JAMIE FOX WAS A BETTER SINGER THAN AN ACTOR FOR THIS MOVIE.BEYONCE WAS JUST RIGHT FOR THE ROLE. I THINK THIS PART DOESN'T HAVE MORE TO GIVE. I DIDN'T LIKE HER SOLO LISTEN. HER VOICE DOESN'T SOUND GOOD SHOUTING THAT MUCH. SHE HAS A SOFTER VOICE AND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER TO FACE THE SONG IN A SOFTER WAY OPPOSITE OF EFFIE'S ROLE SONGSJENNIFER HUDSON DID A GREAT JOB. SHE'S EXACTLY WHAT EFFIE SHOULD BE. SHE ACTS HER SONGS VERY WELL, AND THAT'S THE HARDEST PART OF ALL. WELL DONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steppin to the bad side - Ooh Ooh Oooooh!!","review":"Great movie, Great Soundtrack and Sexy Ladies. What more could you ask for? Jennifer is awesome.

Garage recording? Well, maybe so, but this is still excellent work so strong that it will make little difference to the listener that some of it wasn't done in a studio. Avid Stewartistas and Bloodliners (and you know who you are...) will want this CD to add to their collection of America's best living singer-songwriter (yes, I am serious about that) and for the sheer poetic energy this master artist provides. Newcomers will find the tracks enticing and can rest assured they will not be disappointed and will soon join those who appreciate this under-appreciated artist. If you like folk and/or rock, listen to Cheyenne, Under Heavy Fire, and Wide Eyed in Babylong. Folksters who've been around a while will find Molly Dee and Old John Webb echoing from a time when folk music was dominant. Give it a try - you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Essential","review":"If you are any kind of a fan of John Stewart you have to own this CD. These are some of the best tracks of his music I have ever heard, almost al of it new. It is almost impossible to believe that these were taken from the cutting room floor. How much more precious material has been lost I can't even imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous!","review":"THIS is what the Holy Rosary is all about- NOT so much mantra-like repetitions of Hail Marys, but feeding the mind, heart, and soul with both the written Word of God, commentary upon the Word, and pictures. When I was studying Spanish in Guadalajara, Mexico, over 20 years ago, I found this for sale at a cheap price, and used it constantly there. I'm overjoyed Amazon has made it available here at reasonable cost. A brother priest works with the deaf, and I'm trying to help him translate the words into English, because he believes it's perfect for his people! If you have ANY knowledge in Spanish, this is more than worthwhile as is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close Encounters a Classy Act","review":"Sandra Kitt is the Shakespeare of contemporary romance writing. She brought together an emotional plot of police office and victim and surrounds you into an ethereal setting of enchantment.

My only thing is that she needs to walk away from the policeman--New York theme, I would like to see our male characters have a different occupation sometime. But that is no reason to not still give this book 5 stars. A million handshakes to Ms. Kitt for her outstanding work, please continue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story from a talented author","review":"Sandra Kitt just keeps getting better.

It may have been repetive at times and sometimes a little disjointed in its presentation and maybe even a bit self-serving in boosting Mr. Fineberg's rep but all in all the description of the dolts in Congress and the variety of responses of the victims and the families of victims was mostly heart warming. However why some people expected millions and millions of dollars from the government shows the dark side of human nature; greed even overcomes grief. I recommend this book to anyone interested in American society and how haphazard our government of the people, by the people and for the people works and doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Policy of Questionable Wisdom Praised Lavishly by the Man Who Implemented It","review":"In a book in which he assesses the worth and effectiveness of his own role in implementing a post 9/11 policy to compensate those whose loved ones died in the tragedy, it's not hard to see how Feinberg judges the job done to be an excellent one. Between patting himself on the back for how charming he is in a variety of social settings to the condescending way he looks at the worth assigned to the lives of those who died, this book resembles an extended version of a job interview more than it does a soul searching account of his role in a highly emotional process or a serious analysis of government policy. In short, don't believe the hype and don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"Private Snuffy Smith is a wonderful old film. The DVD has significantly improved the original video quality.The movie synopsis takes you back to where the military would give you food, clothes, and a 21 dollars a day.

Let's hope it will appear on Timeline II. Some other classics also fail: \\"All or nothing at all\\",\\"Heart of Mine\\" or the wonderfull \\"Promise\\" (again, Timeline II?). This cd also sounds much better than some of the original versions (Caldwell used to ruin some of his best music with dull production and/or bad recordings) and this time, at last, his usual version of \\"the man with the hat\\" cover looks professional and classy. I truly expect a Timeline II AND some new material in the very near future (please let's avoid his big band recordings). Timeline I is a classic, full of beautifull music.

There are several interesting performances by Mickey (playing drums and piano) but overall, his Andy Hardy and horse movies are much better and more entertaining. The musical dance production numbers directed by Busby Berkeley in these movies are very strangely overdone. \\"Love Finds Andy Hardy\\" is a great Rooney-Garland classic and a much better choice, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Fun Movies For The Price Of One","review":"This deal can't be beat. Four well-made and light-hearted movies for the classic movie fan. The prints look good so there's nothing to complain about. No extras but then I'm not the type that cares about such things. I'm glad TCM released these enjoyable films for the next generations to enjoy. Highly recommended for those who like high energy musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice touch","review":"A lot of details in this assortment. Made a nice touch to the railyard buildings.

The 'Mints preform simply stunning versions of some of the best, and for the most part obscure, pop songs ever made.

Now available as a much less- UK import, there's no excuse for you to not add this to your collection NOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific introduction for curious Boomers","review":"Listen to the samples! Personal favorites are covers of two great songs whose original versions were also underrated in their own day: \\"Love in the City\\" by the Turtles (whose version featured some incredible power-drumming by Johnny Barbata before he toured with CSN&Y; [\\"Four Way Street\\"] and later joined Jefferson Starship [\\"Red Octopus\\"]); and \\"Louise,\\" an all-out raver from Paul Revere & the Raiders (\\"Spirit of 67\\"). The multi-layered harmonies on both are killer, but the Wondermints revved theirs up. Check out the bass riff in the second verse: it's the Raiders' hit \\"Hungry\\"--on steroids. Too much!This was the collection that made me want to purchase the entire Wondermints' catalog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Although I enjoyed reading \\"The Stormy Petrel\\" (5 stars), \\"Thornyhold\\" (4 stars) and \\"Touch...Cat\\", I was not too impressed with \\"The Ivy Tree\\" or \\"Madam, will you talk\\".They were still a better read than the Artus series though.Right now I'm rereading \\"Madam, will you talk?\\" after many many years again, but even on page 100 I'm wondering why this novel gets so many great reviews here on amazon.com. It's not bad, but it's not that good either.Two stars for the descriptions of Avignon, Nimes, Les Baux, Chateau d'If and all these beautiful places in Southern France, I've been to all of them more than twice, even to Marseille's Canebière and Vieux Port. However, I wish the plot wouldn't be as formulaic. Stewart always describes some young British woman who is trying to overcome her last unhappy relationship (or she is a widow in mourning) and going on a long trip to either Greece or France where she inevitably gets involved in some dangerous adventure while meeting Mr. Right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I absolutely love this band; incredible vocals and music.

Coming from a town like Sunnyside, Indiana, only 100 miles north, I too have been through the struggles that Bruce had experienced.Rhea is a priceless asset to the gay community, not only in rural Indiana, but also to gays and lesbians all over the country. Her dedication and stamina, sometimes seeing the events first hand, has often left me with a sense of pride and a restored faith in humanity. It is very uplifting to read of the positive live that she had provided to her gay son, and I truly believe that this book is a requirement for ANY parent who's son or daughter recently came out of the closet!Here's a standing ovation for Rhea - Thank you for the memories, and thanks for the help over the past years.

Full of detail and insider antecedotes, the book is a fast and entertaining look at UFO's progression over 4 decades. The material is extremely current and draws upon the recollections and perspectives of almost everyone who has been in the band. The only criticism I have is that Popoff seems too quick to write off the band's mid 80s to early 90s work. I recommend this if you are either looking for an introduction to this interesting group or if you are long-time fan.

Plus it was packaged in very cheap material that FORTUNATELY I did not tear up as I was opening it.

I picked it up because my Grandpa was a B-24 pilot in the war and said it was a good fictionalised account of 'his war'.

Both are childhood friends who both join the Army Air Forces during WWII. One is a fighter pilot and the other a bomber pilot.

This is the ultimate text-book of Scepticism, portraying an essence of outsanding literary style, enveloped in blissful, abounding philosophies, not to be taken lightly. One should absorb the massive meaning of the entire book, than assimilate its meaning into one's everyday habit-universe, life-style, or reality-tunnel (or perhaps one has their own name for the same proposition, the arisen definition would be: the way in which the Universe appears through the choices one has made of existing, that have presently become automatic).

The paperback is in good condition, some pages bent down & cover a bit crinkled but in all good condition for the price. I would buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage to Face the Past","review":"This book has not reached its fullest potential. In many ways it has not received the support it deserves from the Christian community. The women's group at our church used this book along with the workbook. It was a time of healing for the group. Bishop Jakes understands the emotions of a woman more than any man that I have encountered does. If you are determined to hold the hurts of the past, the book might become painful. This book pushes you towards healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The book is nothing like I expected. His devotional book with the same title is great. I read it first, and expected the book to be more like that. It was not enjoyable to read and often had to feel embarrassed as I read it on my Kindle at the fitness club...and see the person next to me reading the sexual scenes as well. Little Christian, a lot of secular. Sorry I paid for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was very upsetting to me...first because it addressed several serious issues and in my opinion, left them open-ended at the end of the book. So if as a child or teenager you went through any one of those situations..it didn't do anything but dredge up old tramautic memories without any way to let go of that pain AGAIN. Secondly, I'm not a very spiritual person and I'm not sure if thats the reason I didn't get the message from it that I was hoping to...but I think it would have been a lot easier to do so if he wouldn't have touched on those painful and touchy subjects and then brushed them off so lightly. I think T.D. Jakes needs to stick to ministering in the church and leave that subject material to the professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"honest, appeals to a specific audience","review":"While I can see why so many people have recommended I read this book since I had a past with abuse, I found it a little chauvanistic and written from a man's point of view, but since the author is a man, that shouldn't be surprising. I give it a mixed review...helpful, but puts people into stereotypes sometimes. My neice has attended his church and was very blessed so maybe its just his expression through writing that put me off a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hard Truth","review":"Woman thou art loosed assaults your emotions. You are gripped with the reality of both the difficulty and necessity to forgive no matter what has been done to you in life. The story is constructed by a series of flashbacks in the life of the main character Michelle Jordan. The story shifts rapidly back and forth between the past and the present. I was amazed at how i was able to keep up with the story even with the jostling back and forth. It is a well constructed story and i even caught myself hanging on the character Bishop Jakes' words. The characters are so real that i found myself being tempted to hate some of them. I couldn't understand why Michelle Jordan's mother was so blind. But i was sharply reminded at the end that we are all sinners in need of a saviour. We must forgive as we have been forgiven. This was not just a story but a hard and important lesson. Thanks to Bishop TD Jakes for this masterpiece of essential and extremely unique story telling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woman, Thou Art Loosed!","review":"This book is not for someone who is in the process of overcoming a situation. If you have resolved yourself to the idea that you will not overcome an issue, then TD Jakes may be able to motivate you. This book appears to be a man's opinion of what a woman should do to overcome problems that only women face. The advice would have been better received and written if it had come from a woman who had actually experienced the life situations that were discussed. I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The shiznit!!!!","review":"This is 1 of the best & hardest West Coast albums ever!

I mean, Andrew described him as a hairy pirate. Ewww, no Thank you! All that hair was a complete turn off for me. I wanted to go through the book & cross out all the hair refrences. And at times, I don't think Andrew found him even likable. I was expecting from the cover, that the picture was of Duncan, I mean he is the master of Seacliff afterall but it turns out, it's apparently Andrew. Now on the other hand, the character Steven Charles, yum! Too bad he wasn't the leading man.The story itself was interesting. I did enjoy the plot. If you're looking for lots of sex, this isn't the book for you.

I can listen to it over and over again. Its hauntingly beautiful with so many surprises. John Frusciante is a great muscician and artist. He CAN sing and does it in his own original way. The lyrics are poetic and odd in a good way(like the lyrics \\"every house needs a frame,everything real has a brain\\"). Go get it boyieeeee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a chance on this one","review":"First off, I'm a rabid fan of John's first two solo albums, so you might want to take my review with a grain of salt. I was a little disappointed in this record at first, but i've heard it 3 times now and its starting to grow from me. It's somewhat removed from the earlier works, having dropped a lot of the backward guitar and added 80's sounding synth and drum machines in many of the songs. Also, John's got teeth now, which makes the lyrics a tad clearer. There's tons of inventive guitar work, some thoughful lyrics and a nice overall rainy sunday afternoon feel. I'd recommend this for all fans of his previous work and anyone who enjoys lo-fi home recordings. This is not train wreck music, so if yr trying to buy this to listen to someone who's lost his mind or is so smacked out he cant chord a guitar, go buy something else you rubbernecker. Glad yr back John."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Re-born","review":"I, like most people, started listening to John Frusciante because Im a huge Red Hot Chili Peppers fan. But what I found was something even more amazing than the chili peppers.This is John's first 'clean' solo album, after battling heroin addiction for many years. And the result is a much more lyrically improved effort from his past recordings. The album is very basic, with just johns guitar and words recorded over the top of a drum machine with a little bit of bass thrown in, it sounds very much like a demo. But the quality is once again in the guitar playing, it is clear why the chili's missed him for all those years.Standout tracks for me are Wind up Space, Remain, Fallout, Murderers and Invisible movement.Buy this album, you wont regert it...And thanks to amazon, as Johns work is almost impossible to get in Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music--hire a singer","review":"The music here is very good; haunting, moody, ethereal. At times the lo-fi recording even adds to the ambience. When John starts singing, he loses me. When he sings in his normal voice, I can get used to it. It detracts from the music anyway, but I can handle it. But then on too many songs he reaches for a falsetto he can 't pull off and makes the songs unlistenable. If this were an instrumental CD I'd give it 4 stars for the style and his amazing ability to play the guitar. But the songs have words and John sings them and he shouldn't. I have listened to this CD over and over, but his voice never gets any better and in the end it lessens the songs for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A murky album","review":"The best parts of the album, as noted in other reviews, are the guitar playing and composition, which are quite enjoyable.None of the processing here does anything to improve on Mr. Frusciante's three note range (the growl, the not-so-growl, and the falsetto), and it would have been better to just record the voice straight and clear: with a little more focus, Frusciante could use his unique and world-weary vocal timbre to good effect (one does not have to be a good singer to convey emotion). Without the lyrics enclosed, I would have had very little idea what was being said, due to the distorted vocal. Even with the lyrics written out, they were disconnected, vague and resistant to building an emotional bond with me as the listener. I can see the point of view of the four and five star reviews, and I can feel the talent, but the production, the lack of a solid bass foundation, and the inscrutable poetry undermined the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wish I Could Return This CD","review":"A collection of forgettable songs made unbearable by the singing. Don't buy this CD. It's uninspired music sung by someone with an unpleasant voice.Frusciante should emulate Beck and Santana, who usually follow Zappa's good advice: \\"Shut up and Play Your Guitar.\\"I like Frusciante's guitar playing elsewhere and that's what I bought this CD for. The guitar playing here isn't very good either. The average rating of this CD of 4-stars is utterly puzzling to me. A matter of taste indeed, but what is the matter with taste is more to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming home","review":"Listening to this CD feels like wandering through a strange, yet hauntingly familiar landscape. It has a desertlike beauty to it, barren, but every rock, shadow, whisper, seems to be filled with symbolism, sending out echos that resonate somewhere in the depths of my soul.thank you John"},{"rating":"2","title":"easier on the ear and heart","review":"it's good to have john frusciante back once again. this is by far his easiest album to listen to. i always found smile just a little too depressing to, but t-shirt was amazing in that you entered a whole different world of music and sounds.this album is experiemntal too - but it sounds more modern than just emotionally progressive. i like the folk edge and the tortoise-esque synth beats, the tracks are better constructed and seem to flow rather than blurt out ideas as johns earlier work did.if you are bored of the state of most music today or just want a change of pace this is the stuff. try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star is generous","review":"Romance novels are supposed to have improbable plots and be written rather heavy-handedly. This book, like Rasey's others, raises (or is it lowers?) the bar for utter badness, in plotting, characterization, and writing, even in cover art. Her narrative stumbles along like it was dragging an anchor, and her dialogue reads like it was written by someone who's never listened to two real human beings converse. Perhaps if Rasey would quit publishing her own books and work with an editor . . . . One star is a generous rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty but...","review":"it sure didn't stand up to my henkels( and they're not even the really good ones).. i've used it only a couple times now and tho it's a nice working surface it's already cut to hell.. nice that it's a renewable resource but apparently that means you have to keep buying them.. this will suit the purpose for awhile, and makes a nice serving tray (minus the giant knife gashes) for veggie snack sunday, but i'm going to stop cheaping out on things that look kinda nice and just get myself the butcher block i've been wanting for a long time and that will last for generations.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I am not happy with this product.

To watch her open it and be SO THRILLED just made my day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than other wood boards at this price","review":"So far, so good. I have had this cutting boards for several months. I like the concept of bamboo (great durability & no trees have to be harvested). I have owned other types of wood cutting boards in this price range and experienced cracking or warping after initial use. Nothing so far with this cutting board. It is much heavier than I anticipated. Even thought it is heavy, it is thin enough to store easily. I have bigger, heavier cutting boards but this one has become the one I reach for first. Cleans up great. Works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice for a few months.","review":"After a few months one of the 'raw bamboo' end pieces warped and started to separate from the 'steamed bamboo' body. Now it wobbles on the counter unless I put a towel under it. The grooved edge seemed like it would be convenient but all it seems to do is make the board harder to wipe clean. On the plus side, the surface has held up very well. I will probably replace it with a flat, solid bamboo board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Everyday Board","review":"I purchased this board for my Mother as a present. I am a chef and a great fan of wood cutting boards, as they are faster and safer to cut on, as well as better for the knife's edge and beautiful. I use a huge wooden board at home, but most will not tolerate such a big ugly thing in their kitchen. This board is large enough for real cooking, but small and attractive enough to be left out for immediate use. The fact that it is made of sustainable managed growth bamboo makes it that much better.

It has a place for all your stuff even a towel bar. It was very sturdy it held up through some pretty strong winds. The only thing I would change is in the flooring it has a mesh section on three sides for the water to drain and I would put it on all four sides. There is a place that unzips for you to put your shower hose through and connect the shower head to the top of the tent, We took a black 50 gallon drum and filled it with water and put a pump for a pond in it covered the top with black rubber mat for maximum heating by the sun and hooked a regular shower head to the end of the hose and had enough water for many showers.

We still use the first set for our small family, but know we have a backup set to use in the near future. The only thing I have noticed on the set is that 2 or 3 knives have developed spots on them, but it doesn't keep us from using them.

It's all the familiar great stuff, but utterly marred by the inclusion of the two tracks from \\"Mystery Box\\". In short Mickey, they should have remained a mystery. They are Vocal, R&B; cheesy, saccharine and entirely out of place. If you like to listen to Hart for the shamanic beats and interestingly coloured exotic atmospheres, prepare to program your CD player to skip tracks 2 & 3 as they are just awful and guaranteed to ruin any moment. A poor choice from the producers; no doubt why I was able to buy it on ebay for 1.50.I think there is nothing to be gained for the Hart fan here. One would be better off buying the original albums.

First, she DOES seem to have done extensive research, but then she destroys her credibility by making claims that Bill Clinton may have been Henry VIII, Howard Stern was a harem girl, etc. Her method of determining past lives is by having the reader analyze their interests in THIS lifetime... while I don't doubt for one second that the interests and themes of past lives DO carry on into the next, most of the phenomena she points to could be the product of forgotten childhood experiences.This book IS entertaining, though. It would be good for someone who is only exploring the concept of past lives for the first time, and its exercises are somewhat fun to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & Classy Gift Basket","review":"I bought this basket as a client Christmas gift and was very impressed with the quality of products included.

I changed the filter but it did not fix the issue.Maybe there is certainly a point to consider that eventually you will pull from the cable to get it out of your ear, and this will damage the piece.For such an expensive product, this performance just sucks.I find that I cannot change the first rating I gave, currently I would give only **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible sound","review":"I ordered this headset (the white ones) base on Cnet reviews and the fact that I was looking for a \\"Hi-Fi quality\\" set.

The Etymotic ER6 does an ok job at sound isolating but no more than most in-ear ear buds and they have a low sound quality when compared to the others. The frequency response for the Etymotics is 20 Hz to 16 kHz. For the Sony it is 23Hz to 6Hz. This is a big difference in sound quality especially bass.

They are useable at much lower volumes than non-isolating earphones because you don't need to keep them loud to hear them over surrounding noise.The wires on my previous pair got crisp and failed after about 18 months. The wires on the new ones are very flexible, but I don't know if that's because they are new or because Etymotic is using better materials.These are mid-priced earphones. They don't sound as good as high-end headphones (and I've never tried the most expensive earphones so I don't know how they compare), and they are not as efficient as some earphones, but they are an excellent compromise.

While the active noise-reduction of the Bose is excellent I found the isolating characteristics of the ER6s even better. You don't hear anything. Period.While the Bose do have great noise-canceling they are quite poor in sound reproduction. The sound from my iPod was quite muddy and non-defined, The sound using the ER6 was very clear and sharp with solid, well-defined bass, treble and mid-range.As other reviewers have stated it is imperative that you get a good \\"seal\\" when you insert them into your ear.

I'm able to clearly hear my music at about half the volume.At first I didn't find them all that comfortable, but I've started to get used to them. They are really small relative to cans so it's easy to take them anywhere.The downside is that I can hear my breathing more while I'm using them, and when I turn my head way to the side the seals tend to open up a bit.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Etymotic ear phones","review":"I was very dissapointed in these earphones.

The problem is inside the jack, specifically the wiring. The cables in there break, apparently very easy. And this is not a common jack that can be replaced since there is where their sound technology resides.

I haven't yet had a chance to try them for this, but they do have great sound. I found the plastic buds to be very difficult to place properly in the ear (placement makes a huge sonic difference), but the foam worked nicely and were more comfortable. In normal situations it shuts out sounds quite well (it's hard to hear people talk), and the sound is excellent in all ways except for being a bit bass shy (the bass is there, but loses some of it's \\"oomph\\"). My other 'phones, Koss PortaPro's, which are open, have a more balanced sound overall (and are better in situations you want to hear what's around)."},{"rating":"2","title":"two problems but very good","review":"the length of the cord is too long and if you walk or run, you can hear a thud sound through the earpieces"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough....Lousy bass response","review":"I orderd these hoping to upgrade from my Sony MDR-EX51 earbuds. I was dissapointed! They lack any fullness of bass. The Sonys I already own have significantly better bass and overall sound. I tried endless adjustment in my ears -- pushing them way-in and trying both the foam and silicone eartips -- just could not get a suitable full/robust sound from them. The silicone eartips fit SO snug that they create an air-tight seal. This sounds like a good thing but it really isn't unless you are sitting still. If you are active while listening, an anoying sensation of needing to \\"pop\\" your ears developes becasue there is no natural breathability usually present as part of your ear-canal anatomy.I would say they are very crisp and clear in the mid-range and high frequency but devoid of bass-punch.

No bass to speak of, and as a result, they sound very tinny. I tried all the ear pieces, including the foam, which is similar to my old Koss earphones, but none made much of a difference.

These are HORRIBLE. There is absolutely no bass, and I mean NO BASS at all. I thought there was something wrong with my Sandisk so I plugged in the OEMs but they worked fine. Tried the foam inserts and they didn't help a bit. I already had the EQ set up for maximum bass. I never minded the sound quality of the earbuds that came with the unit, was just bothered by the wind noise while cycling, so was looking for something quieter but with better overall response so I could enjoy the music at a lower volume and still be happy. These are not the answer, I can assure you. I don't know what the reviewer at the top spotlight review was using before these but they must have been pretty awful. Or he works for Etymotic.

I followed the instructions to a T as far as putting them in your ear to form a seal and was pleased that the sound isolation was very good - I couldn't hear anything else in a room full of people talking. However, the output sound quality is very poor: the highs sound quite tinny and the bass doesn't kick at all. I found this to be true for several different styles of music and after monkeying with the EQ on my Dell MP3 player. The sound from my $20 set of Sony headphones is much richer, albeit without the noise isolation. As a final drawback, after a minute or 2, the Etymotics - whether I was using the plastic or foam ear tips - become VERY uncomfortable in your ear. I would strongly advise not buying this Etymotic model and would be very suspicious of the claims they make for their other products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, make sure you can return easily","review":"I did a lot of research and had high expectations for these headphones.

I heard so many good things about these headphones, but, for me at least, they really aren't very good.In the documentation for these headphones, it says that you have to create a good seal in your ears to hear all the frequencies being played. Well, no matter how far I shoved these headphones into my ear I could not get a lick of bass. The middle frequencies are also distorted. Maybe I have weird ears, but they can't even hold a candle to the much cheaper Sony in-ear headphones.

I plugged them into my ipod to listen to classical music and to be honest, it sounded like the orchestra was playing out of a tin can. They did sound fine for pop and rock but as for the classical, it lacked big time. If you are like me and mostly listen to classical, i would NOT reccomend these earphones. They just don't have that full, clean, and pure orchestral sound that is needed for classical listening. I'm definately going to return these and use my old earphones which are far better for classical in my opinion ($20 Philips HE-592's -- haven't found any other in-ear 'phones better than these.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as my sony earbuds and twice the price","review":"I am somewhat disappointed.

Dan has grown up; he started out with love-gone-by lamenting songs and has gradually introduced themes like the preservation of nature and wildlife. He remains a true gem among all singer/songwriters. This video is incomplete, compared to the album; some of his classics (like 'Ol' Tenessee') are missing. But what the heck. It's great to see a man you've admired for so long in action, even if it's only on an TV screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Fogelberg Live-Greetings from the West","review":"I have the VCR copy of this and I purchased the DVD, hoping to have another way to watch it.

Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the whole concert","review":"The show itself, that is what we are allowed to see, is really good. I noticed that near the end, Mr. Fogelberg stated that the he and his band were performing for two hours. However, the whole DVD, which includes interviews interspersed throughout the show, opening credits, and closing credits, lasts one hour and forty three minutes. So, where's the missing concert footage?Not only that but my favorite song of his, Longer, is not included. That is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dan Fogelberg Live - Greetings From the West DVD","review":"Sadly, Dan has left us but what a treat it is to watch Dan perform in his unique one-of-a-kind, never to be duplicated style and to hear Dan speak in between songs. This is a must have for Fogelberg fans. It's a bittersweet concert to watch, knowing he has passed on, but a wonderful treasure for anyone who enjoys the music and talents of Dan Fogelberg.I hope, in time, perhaps another DVD will be made to honor Dan's memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book to appeal to the non-veg Christians in your life","review":"I have argued animal rights and vegetarianism with many Christians and run into the same walls time after time.

When this book became available I was excited to read more in the same vein. However, as previously stated, the characters have no growth, no empathy and create tension simply by fighting amongst each other constantly.Reading the book has become a chore.Also, the author's lack of confidence in our ability to learn vocabulary is a bit off putting. Can we not call every supernatural being a \\"thing\\"? That's what nouns are for. You can introduce them like that if you like, but there are paragraph that read \\"and the yard-thing did this and the forest-thing did that and the water-thing the other...\\" Please! Use nouns, I beg of you.So, in short, prepare yourself for 200+ pages of unlikeable characters fighting with each other, muddled action and endless trudging through swamps and forests.I cannot say I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly unfulfilling","review":"I'm usually a big Cherryh fan, I have enjoyed everything else I have read by her.

Wodehouse's creations never saw a finer performance than from the comedy team of Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry. These first five episodes of Jeeves and Wooster set the tone for the series, all 23 adventures. Hysterical.Bertie Wooster, an upperclass twit with a kind heart, is constantly subject to the whims of his evil aunts and egotistical friends. Bertie is thus perpetually embroiled in trouble, but no fear! His manservant Jeeves will surely save the day every time. Stephen Fry plays Jeeves impeccably - as the valet who is quite frankly smarter than all of the so-called educated upperclass nobs who order him around. But were it not for his sage wisdom, poor Bertie, perfectly realized by Hugh Laurie, would be long since married off to the likes of the awful Honoria Glossop!A must buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A warning for the hearing impaired","review":"I love the Jeeves and Wooster series and highly recommend them to all but with a caveat....

Two men working for opposite sides, one for the British and one for the colonists, have a relationship with the same woman. Their relationship comes to a climax during the battle at King's mountain. Mrs. Fletcher knew the area and the history intimately and writes with skill that is not dated. Planters living near swamps using boats for transportation with descriptions of the plants and animals, open door hospitality, and later divisions within the characters as they are forced to decide whether to support the British or join the colonist when war reaches their homes. This is an excellent choice for those who like historical fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"THESE..............................are spirit fingers!!!!!!!","review":"Way to go!!! Ready???

Dunst is a very wise choice on the lead and all to the other actors just work in around her. The chants and stunts are just remarkable as well as the story line itself.I feel that it is a real crowd pleaser, over all. It is full of good looking guys, and sassy women!!!

Those mount were unbeievable, the basket-tosses were the most amazing. Its against regulation for us to do them, but they were so cool. Though I wonder way no one did any jumps...? I could watch it for hours if I could. This movie shows it ain't easy being a cheerleader easy. The preperation, the nerve-wracking was-that-high-enough-perfect-enough-will-the-judges-hurry-up-with-the-awards-already, and the glorious day of competion!

Even though I have been a fan of Kirsten Dunst for awhile, I was surprised how likeable and funny this movie is. Yes, it is a \\"teen comedy,\\" but is is very good-natured and less stereotypical than the typical teen movie. I liken it to Clueless. It could easily have been a leering comedy that delighted in showing teen cheerleaders, but it has much more depth.Best of all is the straight-faced and sincere commentary track from its director. At the end of the DVD, he comments that he worked very hard making sure that the end credits were correct and looked good, and he goes on to say that \\"If you remeber only one thing about Bring It On, I hope it's the credits.\\" Hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More of Kirsten Dunst, please...","review":"Bring It On sheds light on a high school senior and newly selected cheerleader captain who finds herself under pressure to take her 5-year straight winning team to the finals for yet another shot at the title.

The Romance in the film was believeable and pretty touching and you may go away from the film with a new respect for Cheerleading, which this movie presents as a sport. There is tons of laughs from the \\"spirit stick\\" to some old fashioned ...iness. A fun flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It arrived quickly and was in great condition.

It does have a message, but it keeps things light, so as not to get preachy. The movie doesn't just accept the negative stereotype of cheerleaders. Like, for example, football players, some cheerleaders are nice and some are not, and we get to see versions of each here. My two favorite parts of the film were the opening dream sequence cheer and the closing blooper/gag reel over the end titles to the song \\"Mickey.\\" The movie was a bit predictable and could have used more cheer routines, but it was still very good.Aside from a good movie, the DVD is packed with features. The director's commentary was witty and informative. He also introduced the deleted and extended scenes to explain why they were cut or shortened. The \\"Did you know that?\\" feature displays facts on screen as the movie plays, along the lines of the \\"Pop-up Videos\\" of VH1. This one is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring It On-DVD Version","review":"If you love movies about cheerleaders, than I really recommend you to see this movie. \\"Bring It On\\" it is a comedy about a groupcalled Toros.

Torrance (played wonderfully by Kristen Dunst) is a senior and the new captain of the high school's cheerleading team. But when she finds out that the former captain, \\"almighty popular\\" Big Red, stole the cheers from a small-town squad, things could get ugly for Torrance and her team at competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clueless with an attitude","review":"I expected less from a cheerleader movie. Yes, \\"Oh Mickey you're so fine\\" was stuck in my head for days (Op...there it goes again) but I found the movie to be enjoyable at best and predictable at least. Kirsten Dunst was a pleasant surprise, the high-pitched voice was whiny--anger coming out of a small hole. But all in all, the characters were likeable. True, it doesn't rise to the level of dark teen angst reminiscent of the John Hughes movies of the 80s but it inspires spirit, individuality camraderie and athleticism---traits I didn't readily associate with cheerleaders...until Bring It On."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This film is a well made comedy we don't have to many of those.

Once Missy (Eliza Dushku)joins the team, she notices something isn't right. Then she brings Torrance to the Clover's team. That is when Torrance realizes the whole thing is a joke. Former team captain Big Red is the one who stole the Clover's cheers. Both teams square off with the hottest routines at nationals. This movie is comedy at its best.

You sink deeper, unvolenterrally into the superficial world of cheerleading throughout the long, everlasting two hours.

Well, not only was it not good, it was HORRIBLE. Kirsten Dunst was the stiffest, most irritating cheerleader I have ever seen.

Save your money and spend the night staring at the wall, it will be more interesting than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holds your interest just long enough to disappoint you","review":"The clever, sneering cheer that opens BRING IT ON got my hopes up. As the beautiful young women play to the camera, cheering about how they've got it all - and how you would like to either be one of them or have one of them - I thought I was in for a funny, sexy look at the politics of high school popularity and the competition for it. Alas, BRING IT ON slowly winds down to a TV-movie level story where everyone has to win and no one looks bad. Yet it's worth seeing for its strengths, namely the athletic cheers and especially 18-year old Kirsten Dunst's stunningly attractive torso, which BRING IT ON shows aplenty. I don't think there's a midriff-baring outfit available that the fair-skinned beauty Miss Dunst doesn't wear in this film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Fun, Fresh & Absolutely Amazing!!","review":"I have been a fan of this movie since I first saw it - it is definitely one of the best movies out there. You can't go wrong with \\"Bring It On\\": from the music, to the acting and even the cheering, this movie is a true classic. \\"Bring It On\\" is very funny and you will definitely laugh with Kirsten Dunst and Elisa Dushku (and generally I'm not a huge fan of either one of them) and by the end you won't be sure which squad should or will win, which is great because most movies of this sort are very predictable.

You have the expected competition between the school with money and the school without funds for after-school programs such as cheerleading. The high-end school can purchase the services of a choreographer to create their routine for the annual cheer leading competition. The \\"poor\\" school scores financing by getting their story out to the media. The cheerleaders deliver their competing routines. That's about it. This movie isn't appropriate for pre-teens who I see would be the only interested audience.

The video has no artifacts. The extras on this DVD are agreat. The deleted scenes don't add much to the movie, but are still fun to watch. The best part though is the credit slides of outtakes and other funny stuff. Best one is where Kirsten Dunst yells to the crowd \\"Do you want me to show you my butt?\\" And then she gets disgusted...saying something like \\"You guys are so perverted.\\" Funny stuff.The movie itself is well written, well directed, and well acted on all the parts.

But it goes deeper than that, beyond the usual boy-meets-girl to the heart-breaking story of a brother and sister who cannot let each other go even when each has found his/her soulmate.The acting is stellar (not just Depp's!) and this is a story that should be appreciated for its sincerity and warmth and the courage to tackle the issue of mental illness while still keeping this a comedy.Well-done, all around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collector's item","review":"This is a great product, but I didn't buy it as a toy...

She is exceedingly honest with the reader, including about her own faults, and is therefore infinitely human and endearing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ship Needs Better Instructions","review":"I purchased this product to give to a sailor who served on the Saratoga. Although I have built items like this before, this product presented a challenge. It comes with over 180 pieces which are numbered, but the numbers are random and often fell off the pieces, leaving a lot of guesswork. I could not find the described paints in any craft store so I was forced to choose my own colors. The instructions, or, in this case, the lack of, made the project difficult to complete. The entire process is done without written instructions to accompany the visual guidelines. While the visuals did assist, they were, by far, not helpful in placing some of the smaller pieces.

They played \\"Rocky Mountain Way\\" to death but every once in awhile it still doesn't sound too bad. This whole album is great, check out the end of \\"Days Gone By\\". \\"Happy Ways\\" has a great bass line and \\"Midnight Moodies\\" the only instrumental has some good flute playing. This isn't your typical bass, drums, guitar, vocals rock album. There's alot of extras thrown in and it took me over 2 years to get tired of hearing this album on a fairly regular basis. At one time it was my favorite. I don't have a favorite now but this is still one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've heard this album sound.","review":"I haven't listed to this album in years, but it's always been one of my favorites. Some of the songs on this album appear on various best-of CDs, but the sound quality on those CDs leaves much to be desired. When I saw this Audio Fidelity Gold CD from the original masters, I decide to fill a hole that's been in my collection for a while (I used to have this album on cassette, but I couldn't tell you how long it's been since I owned a cassette player).All I have to say is this sounds great, the best I've heard it. Mr. Mojorisin said the Ultimate MasterDisc version is better, but I can't speak to that, as I've never heard it. I do know this version sounds better than he made it out. Could it be better? Maybe, but if you're a fan of this album, I don't think you'll be disappointed in this version.My only quibble is I wish they had released it on SACD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!

Being older now I wondered why I didn't have it. Now I know. I would not consider this a rock album, the songs are to mellow and sort of dreamy.

Manifesto","review":"I cannot say in any other words how phenomenal Lili Taylor's performance was in this film. This flick was based on the true fact of Valerie Solanas who actually did shoot Warhol. After the shooting, Andy never quite recovered very well, and his health was fragile. As to Valerie, I must correct those that call her a feminist, because the true definition of a feminist is someone that believes in equality for both male and female. Valerie was a male basher, she hated men, and if she could of had it her way she would of (...) every man that crossed her way. Valerie was a delusional maniacal nut case with plenty of sex abuse issues and so on, however you end-up sympathizing for her in the film. Harris's role as Warhol along with Dorff's Candy Darling (who's very convincing as a drag queen) perfect the well put together film directed by Mary Harron. This film is decadent and brilliant, and you can watch it several times before you tire of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revealing the S.C.U.M. manifesto","review":"Excellent indy pic with outstanding performances especially by Dorf, Harris and Taylor, all excellent small-budget mainstays. I liked Harris' portrayal of Warhol, because he's usually represented by someone who just acts aloof and goofy, but here he actually works as a person. Stephen Dorf as Candy Darling and Lili Taylor as Valerie Solanas are entirely convincing. This movie started director Mary Harron's reputation for skillful storytelling, and it was later cemented by her work 'American Psycho.' I greatly anticipate her next film.The Amazon critic here criticized Harron for not taking a stand on Solanos and the S.C.U.M. manifesto. Why? The movie's not about the manifesto, but Solanos' bizarre character and the story of how she shot Warhol. This is done to a T.Great flick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Award Worthy Biography!","review":"I don't know if I Shot Andy Warhol won or was nominated for any film awards but it certainly deserved some. Lili Taylor ( the princess of offbeat roles ) and Stephen Dorff were at their best. If Hollywood was smart enough to recognize talent over looks then Taylor should have won an Oscar. Taylor once again delivered a wonderful performance showing she can make any role her own. Dorff not only played a convincing drag queen but was so realistic you'd actually think he was a woman. The film is a todrey, strange look into the life of writer Valerie Salinos ( sp? ) a feminist, man-hating butch that took feminism to the highest level. This film may be uncomfortable and at times socially disturbing but it gets the job done by telling Valerie's life realistically. It's nothing short of entertaining as well. Highly recommended especially for fans of Lili Taylor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Andy Warhol (?) New York Tale","review":"An American story of aiming a popularity (and money) by any means possible as lone feminist came to New York, employed by Andy Warhol and taken \\"revenge\\" over a boss having her works seemingly \\"stolen\\".Nice performing, also Andy Warhol looked a bit different thanscreened usually."},{"rating":"1","title":"I SHOT LILI TAYLOR..","review":"I SHOT LILI TAYLOR AFTER I HAD TO SIT THROUGH THIS MOVIE..

But the character of Valerie Solanas is such an annoying bore, with absolutely no redeeming or sympathetic qualities, that this is a real drag to watch. The reennactment of Solanas's play about turds (!!) was especially stupid and pointless. And the movie makes the Factory seem totally boring and Warhol totally talentless, too, even though I think they did occasionally do interesting work.As others may have mentioned, Michael Imperioli (Christopher of The Sopranos) has a small role, and John Ventimiglia (the restaurant owner on Sopranos) has a TINY and rather pathetic role as a guy who gets off on watching lesbians have sex!

But even with all that, I wasn't going to call it a TERRIBLE movie until the main man and woman decided they were in love for no reason at all. Someone decided plot development wasn't as important as grisly images and bad camera tricks. The fake southern accents and 20 thousand uses of the word yankee will cover that up right? Now, all that's just my reaction as a random viewer. As a Marvel fan, I was down right offended at the lack of adherance to any of the main ideas of the comic book.

It's a lot catchier than anything I have heard on the pop channels for years. \\"I'm your man,\\" is particularly great. It makes for a great accomplice to Halo matches. If you're a fan of the Gunt you have got to have it. After all, it's a no-no, and you like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am hooked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Jesus... when I ordered some CD's that came with this CD and I knew I never ordered this CD and I figured I would listen to it and I am hooked!!!

It's great to hear what was on the rap scene way back in '90 an '91. Granted, some of Ice's lyrics are a bit simplistic, but entertaining none the less.

Remember The Simpsons, rap music, and the Internet? I know I do. And if you remember rap from the 90's, you undoubtedly remember these two artists: Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer.Once on top of the world (and Billboard charts), Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer are now fodder for countless \\"Where are they now?\\" shows. Furthermore, they are endlessly mocked for their lightweight entries into the rap genre. However easy it may be to mock them, it is even easier to forget their true contributions: namely, bringing rap music into the mainstream. No matter how much is made of, say, Public Enemy's surprising cross-over appeal, one must concede that mainstream popular music still considered rap as an alien entity. That is, until Vanilla Ice and MC Hammer brought their own brand of watered-down, whitewashed pablum to the stage.So, sit back and enjoy the greatest hits of these two ex pop sensations, whether for their historical significance, kitsch value, or just plain fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vanilla Ice and Hammer--You can't lose!","review":"Cheesy as it is, this CD is a must-have for any fan of 90's music.

Here's to more cheesy beats that everybody knows the words to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A LITTLE KNOWN JEWEL FROM HIP-HOP'S GOLDEN ERA!!!","review":"I really miss this era when Rap made sense and did not glorify killing and degrading women. Unique is an excellent lyricist and Dashan's production (RIP) added a unique chemistry. I am glad to see this album re-released and I hope it does well. This album was the precursor for the X-Clan (notice the hat and black medallions) and was one of the first of the Conscious Raps, although there's something on there for everyone! Unique & Dashan deserve their place in Hip-Hop History!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely intro to a fascinating region","review":"I've been interested in Mayan culture since I was a kid. I went to the Yucatan for the first time in 1999 and used this as a light refresher course on the region's 'discovery'.It's a great little intro containing lots of details about the early adventurers - and their ideosyncracies. There are great pictures and illustrations which go along with the text. It all links up really well and takes you through many aspects of the main cities that have been uncovered.That said, it doesn't tell you much about the history of the Mayan culture. You won't come away understanding anything about the Mayan calendar, social customs or their religion. It's really just a good yarn about the mad blokes who roamed the forests looking for adventure...and found it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best veggie dip ever","review":"I have loved this stuff since I was a kid, and I can honestly say I've never had it on a sandwich.. that sounds a bit odd to me.What it *IS* amazing for is a raw veggie dip.

I actually came online to find out if the \\"Famous\\" in the title was just a gimmick to make me buy it.

This is one of them - an enjoyable film about grownups who find pleasures in life - making music and finding old friends, and sharing their best with their children. Actually, their grandchildren, since the children are often stuffy about what their parents are really like. Certainly, Dame Judi's are scandalized when she whips out her old saxaphone and starts blowing on street corners with a street musician. Not all of her audience is unappreciative: she gets a note from Ian Holm that says \\"Fancy a bit of fun, dearie?\\"Well, do you? There's more than a bit of fun to be had here, especially when Olympia Dukakis blows that trumpet. And wait till you see Leslie Caron on a bull fiddle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Judi Dench in Last of the Blonde Bombshells","review":"Ithink I became a fan of Dench's when she wss in a british sitcom \\"As Times Goes By\\" This particular film, is told in a narrative fashion along with inserts from the past when she was young a playing in a band in the 1940's.The bones for a story was there, however, it just didn't work at all for me. It was if a group of people agreed to make a movie without a script and agreed to just wing it. This along with Dench's \\"Mrs. Brown\\" completely turned me off as to her charm which I always enjoyed. Either she has no taste in selecting scripts or she just doesnt care.Oh yes, I see Oliva Dukacis on the cover on the DVD, I think she probably has a sentence if that as she plays an alcoholic.

I actually didn't know before this that Amazon doesn't cooridnate returns with outside vendors listed on the site, and as a result of my experience on this purchase, will never buy anything that lists a vendor as the purchase agent. It was a complete rip off. I've never had a problem with \\"Amazon\\" backed purchases, but with this product via this vendor, no refund was ever processed.

My 5 yr old didn't like playing But I LOVE the game!!! I ended up playing and he enjoyed watching sponge bob meet barnacle man. I hate games that you need a book & Internet to figure out (like tomb raiders), this one is easy but Challenging too!!!

While by no means comprehensive, this is a concise and well written text that extends to the multivariate case the necessary tests that are performed for the more commonly generated univariate time series models. I was pleasantly surprised at the job that the authors performed in developing some of the important ideas, as opposed to simply presenting equations.In the text, methods covered include testing for joint stationarity, normality, independence, cointegration, and causality. There is also a section on the specification of multivariate linear models. Unfortunately, discussion of multivariate nonlinear models amounts primarily to literature references. Finally, there is a discussion of testing for model order and forecast accuracy. Overall, I found this to be a highly useful text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multivariate Tests for Time Series Models (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)","review":"The book looks at multivariate time series and plots tests of them a bid too short.

The ONLY reason we stayed was that our daughter was in an adjacent theater watching another movie so we couldn't leave the theater and would have ended up standing around in the lobby for an hour waiting for her movie to end.It was moronic and basically just plain stupid....nuff said since I think you'll get the idea I'm trying to give you here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Amanda Peet","review":"I suppose this film gets one star for putting the shoe on the other foot and letting the famale character be the manipulator...but other than that, not much to it! I love Amanda Peet and was excited to see this, and while she does a decent job, the film is just silly and trite. And sorry to disagree with the other reviewer from Denver who compared it to Sex and the City...but I know Sex and the City and this is no Sex and the City! Sex and the City is not only trendy and fun, but intellegent and insightful. There is nothing intellegent about this film and nothing insightful about these characters. (And if there were no such thing as anti-gay slurs and slang terms, this writer would have had trouble getting much of a script together at all!) If you want to see empowered women or get some insight into today's dating scene, get Sex and the City!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever Made","review":"If I ever make a list of the worst movies I've seen in my life, Whipped will certainly be in the top (bottom?) five. Amanda Peet must have been in desperate need of money to agree to participate in this annoying, idiotic and witless movie.The only thing worse than the screenplay are the male actors. Granted, they are not given much to play with, since their characters are such stereotypes they might as well be cardboard cutouts (the geek, the player, the boring married guy) but still, I have rarely seen such terrible and unappealing performances on the screen.As for writer-director Jonathan Abrahams, what can I say? If this guy managed studio executives to finance and distribute this movie, he could probably sell snow to Alaskans. Abrahams should be in sales, not in movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like having an electric drill run through your skull.","review":"The fact that this movie has received a positive response here is disturbing. It is painfully, migraine-inducingly bad. It contains the intelligence of a toaster, and the creativity of a pile of shoes. Anyone who claims it to be a 'realistic' or 'satirical' portrait of anything resembling real life has, like this movie, no actual connection to the real world. This insipid piece of swill is alternately crude, nauseating, boring, humorless, and highly, thoroughly unoriginal. For your own safety, please stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Life Story","review":"This CD is the musical story of Elizabeth Short. The composer became fascinated with the life of a woman who, seeking love and the fulfillment of her dreams, found despair and an early death instead. This story is passionately told.Although the CD has a music noir feeling running through it, especially cuts 1, 4,5 and 9, there is a lot of other interesting jazz. \\"In Flight\\" and \\"101 North\\" are real burners. \\"The Edge of Forever\\" is a high energy orchestral celebration. \\"Zanzibar\\" has a distinctly African flavor. And \\"Danza d'Amore\\" is a chance for Joe Lovano to showcase his considerable skills.All of the cuts have a distinct theme and are there to tell the story. Each has a musical message. I really like the music on this CD and highly recommend it. It's one of my top ten jazz CD's of 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does an excellent job of recreating book series.","review":"Our book club has been reading the trilogy by Paul Scott.

The British Raj comes to life as if it were taken from individual life videos of each character portrayed. It has everything suspense,mystery,passion,love and death! Historically believable. It is a series you can watch straight through on the edge waiting for what follows next! Highly recommended for all Raj lovers and for those who know nothing of this part of British history, truly a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Sad Story With An Unhappy Ending","review":"Very involving drama circulating around a number of characters in the last years of British rule in India. The plot never telegraphs its destinations, which keeps the story somewhat disorienting, and nothing quite resolves, if it resolves at all, the way I expected. A good reminder of how Hollywood films tend to predictability. JITC is not Hollywood and gives more the feel of life and its genuine uncertainties. It's challenging because of the number of characters and the complexities of the relationships, both personal and political. But very worthwhile.The DVD is not a bright, crystalline picture. Colors are somewhat washed out, and the image is not particularly sharp, especially in dark scenes. However, the picture is generally free of annoying blemishes. After quickly adjusting to the picture quality, I enjoyed the series very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent series - Appalling digital transfer","review":"Heed Spoffo's warning.While the series itself is wonderful and certainly worth owning, I have NEVER seen a worse DVD transfer. Even my seedy Madacy Entertainment copy of Fritz Lang's 1226 \\"Metropolis\\" is of higher quality. The visuals are fuzzy and grainy at the same time, and there are severe block artifacts everytime the screen gets even slightly dark. All scenes shot at night or in the darkness are almost unwatchable because of the visual noise.The sound seemed alright to me at first, but then I turned the volume up a bit and found that there is a kind of low-pitch static, like machine noise underneath the vocals and music.Please buy the VHS tapes - and let A&E; know that this is simply unacceptable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"My mistakeThe DVD won't play in our regionPerhaps it should be more clearly indicated what areas DVDs can be viewed inSeems pretty strange anyway... such sophisticated technology that won't work in half the world"},{"rating":"2","title":"I just was waiting for it","review":"Back in 1982 I bought in Abu Dhabi the Jewel in the Crown in 12 VHS and I am happy I have seen it in only 4 DVDS at Amazon.

This book has nothing to do with that series - but, I enjoyed the book. I can't say I picked up any 'hot' fishing locations or technigues . . . but, 'Covered Waters' is just, IMHO, a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not what I expected.","review":"Fitzgerald has an amazing style of writing. Afer a few short stories and Gatsby, I thought I'd love Tender is the Night. In the beginning of the book (book1), I was totally absorbed with Fitzgerald's descriptions and idealism and perfection of Dick Diver. When Rosemary left as 'narrator,' I thought the book went somewhat downhill, along with Dick. But then, that's how the story goes. I fell for the disillusionment at the start, and was disappointed as the 'real' was revealed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting Italian Taxi Cab Drivers","review":"Dick Diver fist fights with insolent Italian cab drivers, calls an arabian princess a \\"spic,\\" screws around with a hot young actress, insults dull society women, humiliates himself, destroys his life with affectation and affection that is unparallelled in literature. He is a Modern version of Pechorin from Lermontov's \\"A Hero of Our Time.\\" Nicole Diver, his wife, is also well drawn by the master of the Jazz Age, but Dick's character study is the goldmine of this novel. I feel that the \\"madness\\" aspect of the novel is the dullest part, what Fitzgerald is truly interested in is catalogueing the slow unraveling of a talented, egotistical, alcoholic man, i.e. himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKED IT AS MUCH AS I REMEMBERED","review":"I hadn't read Tender Is the Night for at least a dozen years. Maybe more. Though I thought of it as one of my favorite books, I realized when I began re-reading it that I had forgotten much of the story. The one thing that was still fresh in my mind was the sense of tragedy I associated with Dick. By that I mean, I remembered him as a tragic figure. What was the source - arrogance, impatience, fatigue, attraction to money, alcohol? All of those? None of them? I'm not sure. I am sure that Dick is an intensely personal representation of Fitzgerald himself. Tommy Barban be damned. He's a charlatan. If nothing else, I can only hope Nicole realized how much she lost when she lost Dick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex, interesting, and enchanting-- a must read!","review":"Fitzgerald is one of the most interesting authors ever, and you will enjoy how his real life parallels the characters in this book. I would reccommend reading this book slowly so that you can follow the plot and really get into it. If you liked Gatsby, you will surely love Tender Is the Night.. the Gatsby of a different color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring is the Night","review":"I gave up at page 85. I'm sorry, I tried, but I just can't get through this dragging ponderously written story where nothing important happens and the text jumps around without completing a line of thought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooo boring.","review":"This book turned me off F. Scott Fitzgrald. I was very excited to read it, as I've heard it portrays what Fitzgerald was going through at the time, and that he \\"poured his soul\\" into writing it. Well, I caution you to stay away from this book and stick to Gatsby. I feel terrible giving it a 1 star review, but I literally cannot recommend this book, ever... and I'm a fan of literary fiction (which this book is like), i.e. Raymond Carver, Chekov, etc. But Fitzgerald seems to drone on and on about the same topic, following the life of affluent drunks. If you like to read about what older rich people do when they drink (fight, sleep together, debate politics), this will be an interesting read for you. If not, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tender is the Night","review":"No one in my book club liked this book Why is it a classic. Different times I guess. The characters had no depth, it rambled. I think F Scott was drunk when he wrote this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and illuminating","review":"This book is full of paradoxes that make you wonder who exactly could invent such a theme. FitzGerald is the answer. He has a capacity like very few others to captivate an audience who may not completely understand his point of view or motive. Nicloe's illness gives an interesting twist to the plot which otherwisse would be a boring story of romance, deception, and of course society. This is a great work of Fitzgerald's but should not be the first book one reads by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty disjointed","review":"Notwithstanding the outstanding quality of Fitzgerald's other novels, this one is definitely not a must read. The plot drags along wearily at places, settings and places are not always well captured (Fitzgerald's sketch of the Riviera life does not really convince me), characters are weakly drawn, undecisive, some caricatures. The life of the main protagonists of the story does not offer enough interest in order to keep the reader interested in them for such a long novel. Except maybe you are specifically interested in psychiatrist maladies. It is neither a tragedy nor a humorous book nor just a tantalizing story, but an unsuccessful mixture of all three. Read The Great Gatsby to get the best of Fitzgerald. The book spent three years on my shelf after being bought and having read the first 30 something pages, and justly so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly Bad","review":"I am not a big fan of F.Scott Fitzgerald's, but I do believe he had genuine talent. Unfortunately, Fitzgerald's talent is sorely lacking in this novel, Tender is the Night. The characters are neither attractive or entirely believeable, and the jerky transitions from scenes and time frames are exhausting to follow. I regret to agree 100% with Hemmingway's scathing review of this novel. Fitzgerald fans should check out the movie version of Tender is the Night starring Jennifer Jones and Jason Robards to appreciate what Fitzgerald may have been aiming for in his novel of love and the unintentioned consequences of a mismatched couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender is the Night","review":"The book was in okay condition -- but the spine of the book was very dry and as I read it the book literally fell apart. The book itself was very good. The plot was compelling, the characters detailed and the readability excellent.I could see the influence of filmmaking on Fitzgerald."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glorious with a side of awesome","review":"I really like this author and he has an unmatched ability for subtle description, his works are definitely must reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Painful Attempt to Justify Way He Treated Zelda","review":"Fitzgerald's most aggravatingly uneven novel is thinly disguised justification for the way he treated Zelda, the novelist's beautiful and multi-talented wife.In reality, Scott had her committed to a mental hospital where she was effectively beaten down into a very lifeless and sorry state, her glow and drive vanished. Tender is the Night paints a creepily pretty picture of a handsome, brilliant, young psychiatrist two-timing on his beautiful and flawed heiress wife.It's just a rough read when you know what really happened between the two.I regret my time spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big fat flop","review":"It's an utter failure. Because it's a character study without the slightest trace of characterological depth. Dick & Nicole remain dead on the page all the way thru. And please don't give me any crap about how Dick & Nicole were \\"deliberately written as ciphers in order to reveal their emptiness\\" because I'm not buying it. I certainly don't think that it was Fitzgerald's intention to render them as ciphers. But that's about the extent of his accomplishment here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is no classic","review":"I had been reading Hemingway and thought I might as well read Fitzgerald. Oh dear. What a waste of time. I read 3/4 of the book and threw it in the dump. I fully agree with another reviewer. Fitzgerald on one book in him...and this was not it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal Reality","review":"It's often hard to separate the work from the author, and never more so with \\"Tender is the Night.\\"This world is not beautiful, nor are the people particularly noble, but there portrayed with such brutal honesty I couldn't stop reading until the very end.I did not enjoy this nearly as much as \\"Great Gatsby,\\" but it is a great representation of the man, his life, and the times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the words alone, even without the story.","review":"I cannot help think that I started reading one story and ended with another.In book one we muddle through a pleasant world confused at all the characters that seem unnecessary. In book two we begin to become interested and by book three, we are hooked and left, at the end, slightly uncomfortable - feeling we have witnessed not fiction but Fitzgerald's own story of drinking and demise; his own wife's madness.The prose itself is flawless and beautiful. This is the work of an amazing writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Work of F. Scott Fitzgerald","review":"Tender is the Night was a great novel! Many have compared it to The Great Gatsby, however, I would say that this book is much more complex and interesting and differs very much from it. The novel is very descriptive and catches my attention through is vivid explanation of the setting on the Riviera, and Dick and Nicole Diver's home, the Villa Diana. The novel maintains a sense of mystery in the beginning, and allows the reader to grasp a sense of the relationship of Dick and Nicole, and how the perfect appearance of Dick and Nicole masks their true struggles. The novel is a partially autobiographical novel about F. Scott Fitzgerald and his wife, and this emotional book becomes more and more intriguing until the last page. This book will be interesting to those who enjoy reading about the splendor of the 1920's and the beauty of the Riviera, while still analyzing a very wonderfully complex plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Story, but nothing extraordinary.","review":"Tender is the Night is a very well written and engaging novel. However, it is a far cry from some of Fitzgerald's other works. By no means did it impart the dramatic and profound portrayals of The Great Gatsby, yet it did create a certain amount of sympathy for its leading characters and the lifestyle as a whole. Again, Fitzgerald does what he does best in portraying the lifestyles of the upper-class during the 1920's.I would recommend this book for those interested in the culture of the 1920's and for mere entertainment's sake, but it is not as profound a novel as it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"A wrong choice","review":"Tender is the Night is a novel of bourgeoise boredom. The book has a very promising premise - what would happen if a young psychiatrist was to marry his rich and beautiful but unstable patient? Big fat conflict, just like the size of the book might suggest? No dice - an occasional glimpse of genious sinks in a routine and boring ramblings about the characters' life in high society. I was really dissapointed. So I advise everybody to start with the Great Gatsby, I hear it's much better and I know now that Tender is the Night is a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the jazz age with the rich and glamorous","review":"I tried to read this because it's a standard of the American novel in the 20s. But I could not finish it. The characters are rich, spoiled, glamorous and fascinating to each other. But that's all. Imagine a novel length fantasy written for a Hollywood gossip magazine. That's what you have here.The writing is occasionally striking, but there is nothing in it that I want to read about.I think it was Hemingway who quoted Fitzgerald as saying \\"The rich are different from you and me.\\" Papa's answer: \\"Yeah, they have more money.\\" That sums it up quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought I would love this book","review":"based on what I had read about it, but I did not. There were parts that I liked, passages that are well-written, but overall the writing is stilted and the narrative choppy. There is an air of self-importance in the narrative itself that rivals that of the characters, which has the effect of downplaying their snobbery. There are also a few instances in Book 1 where Fitzgerald felt the need to tell the reader about, even though he had already shown, Rosemary's naivete. I also agree with the reviewers who said that Fitzgerald failed in presenting the psychology of Nicole's illness accurately."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing","review":"This book is so deep, I can't describe it in any other way but life changing. It takes the reader deep into human emotions so true to life and touches the heart of the reader with the ability to change one's way of thinking. It is an example of how people can do things to each other without thinking of consequences and the reaction of others to such things. Poses the question, is it worth the history of a relationship to seek out some new and exciting pleasure, and should someone examine the possible emotional outcome before delving into something so quickly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard read!","review":"I couldn't get into this book.

Boulez is by far the only conductor who truly understood his music. Even the renderings of Varèse's pupil, Chailly, are fairly disappointing in the light of these. I consider Chailly's 2-CD intégrale to be useful only for its transfer of the unique Poème électronique (and for it contains also some rare works, but these are something that maybe only scholars will be interested in). Finally, I must mention that there's also another referential CD in this wonderful mid-priced Boulez series which contains his renderings of Varèse's Déserts and Hyperprism altogether with Carter's Symphony for Three Orchestras. So, for anyone interested in 20th-century (serious) music, buy this CD right now!! and check out for the latter, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it so much I got the rights!","review":"Upon hearing this musical I loved it so much I went out and got the rights to direct it onstage this October in Cincinnati! I was always a fan of Jim Steinman's music, but I now also have a great respect for the lyrics of Ray Fox. Fox is a wordsmith much in the tradition of Stephen Sondheim, with intricate wordplay and quick patter. I would suspect that it was his early work with Fox on this project that led Steinman himself into developing into a world class, phrase twisting. lyricist himself. And of course you have Steinman's great ear for melody, but with a much different feel than his Rock music. A great lost treasure of American theater (come see it in October!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"I'm listening to this CD right now.

I liked the product because it did help support my back but... the one thing that would have made me like it better is if the support band that goes under the belly was wider. It tends to leave a mark right under my belly button that makes me itch once the belt comes off. I am 8 months pregnant but because the baby is big and I am little I measure like I am full term.

He identifies common themes - like the apocalypse - in all religions, and equates these themes with psychological experiences.Wrong. Religion is not equivalent. Three interrelated faiths - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all deny each other's central doctrines. When we move out from the West, we see such diversity of religious beliefs that no common theme emerges.Religious experience ranges from animism (where you can be healed of your ailments by absorbing the soul of a bird) to certain types of Buddhism that don't even believe in a god. The idea of a common \\"religion\\" is simply false - especially when you realize that Atheistic philosophies like Communism and Nazism are fully-functional religions in their own right.Shermer's warmed-over Jungian approach is 100 years out of date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly orchestrated social analysis","review":"This brilliantly orchestrated journey into the depths of human emotion and science are a joy for the beleiver and the skeptic. Dr. Shermer examines every facet of the sociological and psychological impact of people and their belief systems. To the keen reader, this book asks hard-hitting and provocative questions as to the nature and depths of those ideals we hold to be truth. While at the same time dissecting pseudo-sciences and archaic models for belief and rationality for what they truly have become: Dying paradigms in a critical thinkers world!! Books such as this have special places in the hearts of those who hold truth to be the ultimate goal of scientists, secularists and religious scholars.

This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator. The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted. There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it. I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation.

Many of my friends think there are better films...but this is such a beautiful work . The acting in it, Bruce Davidson, Mark Lamos, Stephen Caffrey, Mary Louise Parker,....so miraculous, so rich. The movies is heartbreakingly sad, the plague in human terms, but at times, extremely funny. The string quartet of ymca is quite amazing.

Compelling story line and definitely creates an accurate reflection of gay life when Aids first broke in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the times beautifully","review":"\\"Longtime Companion\\", the first full-length chronicle of the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, remains as fresh a look today as when it was made in 1990. Beginning with the discovery of a \\"gay cancer\\" in 1981, the film follows a group of loosely-knit friends on a year-to-year basis throughout the decade, and does so with empathy and humor. There are many fine performances, including a moving one by a young Campbell Scott.\\"Longtime Companion\\" seeks to reflect but also to educate, reminding viewers that the deaths of these friends held meaning not only for their intimates but for the larger community as well. AIDS may not make the headlines it once did, but it still warrants a good deal of medical attention through research and human consideration for those who have the disease. It would be fascinating if an updated \\"Longtime Companion\\" could ever be made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Longtime Companion","review":"I absolutely love this film.

It captures the feeling of those frightening first years more completely than any other movie I have seen. It also presents many \`normal' gay men who do not fit the stereotypes so many others force them into. I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone wishing to see a well-written, emotionally charged film about friendship and love during an extremely difficult time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I really wanted to love this movie, but it is badly written and acted.

It depicts how a group of friends are affected, and the profound losses they suffer. The film ought to be seen by anyone who feels unaffected by the crisis, and everyone who unfortunately has. MGM did not anamorphically enhance this DVD, but did provide a widescreen transfer. The image is second rate. Also, there are no extra bonus features to speak of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Barbara Stanwyck western suitable for family viewing","review":"The Maverick Queen is a classic Barbara Stanwyck western suitable for family viewing. The plot is straight forward with just enough surprises to keep your interest. Stanwyck's character, the Maverick Queen, is similar to her role as Victoria Barkley in The Big Valley--a strong woman in a man's world. One of the best things about the movie is the spectacular scenery. The Maverick Queen was shot on location in and around Silverton, Colorado. It utilizes excellent footage of a real life slice of history, which is still much the same today. Hollywood staging cannot compare to the real location shots available in Silverton. I highly recommend viewing this classic western filmed in spectacular Silverton, Colorado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello?","review":"This album deserves so much more attention than it received.

It was nice to see songs from Townes Van Zant and Robert Earl Keen, though the strongest songs on the album are the two traditional ones. While I think this is a wonderful album and a nice departure for Lovett, I was disappointed not to see any female artists. What about Nanci Griffith? It is a little disappointing that out of a two-disc set, there is not one female songwriter that had any influence at all on Lyle Lovett. This album lacks the hooks that earned Pontiac, I Love Everybody, and Road to Ensenada the coveted 5 star rating, but it is still an important piece of Lovett's work and definitely worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Count me In","review":"Another fine collection of songs,although not his that fit prefectly well with Lyle's style of playing.

Compare this to Lyle's version, where he drops the \\"daddy\\" and sings one of the most beautiful ballads I've ever heard. Much more of a love song than anything else.

It opens up new (to me) artists, and gives me a deeper understanding of the singer themselves.\\"Step Inside This House\\" is one of the greatest incarnations of a cover/tribute album I've heard. Lovett is, of course, a great singer.

Take the phone off the hook, get your main squeeze, grab a cold beverage, head to the back porch or rooftop, put in this CD and watch the sun fall into the west! Another gem by Lyle.

For those who crave songwriting and singing of great depth and poetic beauty, look no further than this Texas-born songsmith.For \\"Step Inside This House\\" Lyle took a break from songwriting duties to honor his major influences, most of whom come from the Lone Star state. The irony is that he's also fashioned one of his greatest achievements.This sprawling collection mixes folk, blue grass, and country.

Unfortunately it has not - it is still a reasonably good book but not what I had hoped for and is therefore a little disappointing! Also it is printed in a very cheap form, without any pictures of recipes and not even one of Laura Calder, and one feels that this book was very cheaply put together. I realise that the price wasn't very expensive although when converted into our NZ $$$ plus postage etc. it became quite expensive.

Instead, I keep it in my breakfast room, where I savor (no pun intended) a bit each morning & select a recipe to try that day.As in her Cooking Network show, Ms. Calder glides seemingly effortlessly through the various recipes, each studded with twists to make them her own invention.

And thats saying a lot, seeing as NSV was a fantastic piece of work. However, on this album, Cryptopsy really perfected thier sound, with mind-blowing musicianship and unmatched brutality. Also, Mike DiSalvo is a vast improvement over Lord Worm. Lord Worm had a very unique voice, and it was cool in the sense it sounded TRULY inhuman, but it lacked any sort of musical quality. DiSalvo is not the best death vocalist either, but he works very well for the band, and his voice fits right in with the brutality. The production on the album is also incredible; everything is crystal clear, crunchy, and pummeling. But lets not forget the most amazing aspect of the band: Flo Mounier! He is possbly the best drummer death metal has ever seen. He is incredibly tight, technical, groovy, FAST, INTENSE; his skill is already legendary. As long as this band has Flo, they will forever be amongst the greatest bands in death metal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"This cd is unbelievable!! it is fast and the vocals go well with the blast beats and fast guitars.

His previous works are all marked by a truly arduous hunt for clues, a thorough and cautious analysis('onion' theory notwithstanding), and ultimately a very convincing and original case.Unfortunately, Graham's detective skills are largely wasted on a subject that is so many million miles away. In this book, Graham has no more raw data available to him, than any other writer on the subject; while some of his 'reinterpretations' of the evidence are thought-provoking, their just isn't enough of it to sustain the book.

Anyone who doubted Mr. Hancock's grip on reality should check this out. Of course his cult following will believe anything he says or writes, but this book is DE BOMB for his ideas.

When closer photos of the Cydonia region revealed his monuments to be natural features (some of them actually shifted out of position), he reacts by concocting a NASA conspiratorial mentality founded in Cold War attitudes. For those who place great stock in pattern recognition, isn't this a pattern?

To bolster his non-case, he resorts to predictable accusations against the establishment (NASA this time, not Egyptologists).

I realize all these years later that it is kind of a teen movie, but only because it involves high school students. Crazy man Dennis Hopper puts in another great performance. This movie asks the question, \\"What would you do?\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"The characters in this movie were just so damn annoying. Especially Crispin Glover. His character is easily the most annoying character I've seen. I know they were trying to make some point about kids being desensitized but everyone was either really annoying to just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crispin Glover is the worst actor of all time","review":"It's almost worth sitting through this snore-fest to see what is undoubtedly the worst, most annoying and akward performance ever.

It's worse than you can even imagine."},{"rating":"2","title":"thanks","review":"love kenau reeves and i love this movie and been looking for it everywhere and found it and bought it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Death and Apathetic Teens","review":"This movie really shows how dangerous apathy can be. It's both sad and scary to see that only one of the teens actually seems to care about what might happen to his murderous friend. Though the tale is a dark one, the acting of Crispin Glover really cracked me up. To be honest, I bought this movie just from seeing clips of his character, Layne, and I'm very glad that I did. Aside from Glover's hilarious lines, Keanu Reeves does a good job as a sort of \\"front man\\" for the story.Don't buy this expecting a happy ending, because really, how happy can things be when a girl has been killed by a former friend? But it's definitely worth checking out, especially if you like Crispin Glover. (You can tell I'm a big fan from my review of \\"Willard\\" as well.) Keanu Reeves fans will probably enjoy it, too, because he perfectly emulates the laid-back 80s teen that drinks and smokes but doesn't go too overboard like he did in his Theodore \\"Ted\\" Logan role."},{"rating":"2","title":"misunderstood.","review":"If you rate Crispin Glover as annoying , you unfortunately know very little about movies, let alone art. You are probably best suited for a classic Hollywood pictures like Titanic or Big with Tom Hanks or maybe even Twilight. At least you will get the satisfaction of being like everyone else , thinking the same thing as everybody else and using your brain very little and being very satisfied that you are as interesting as an old paint chip. aka 99.9999999999% of people on planet earth.

This is most clearly reflected in the classroom scene where the baby boomer teacher tries to to excite his students about the 60's (\\"It was an exciting time\\"). The students can only react with disinterest. The baby boomer has no idea that his generation is, more than anything, about the destruction of all values. The students, however, are much more insightful. They do know it, and they take it to heart. Wake up hippies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Really Is Dated","review":"I finally saw this movie for the first time. Although it is not currently available, I requested it from my local video store and they were able to find a copy. I had always looked forward to seeing this movie and had heard a lot about it, but I was very disappointed. I totally agree with the reviewer above (or below?) who called it dated. I'm sure it was really powerful back in the eighties, but boy how times have changed. The performances are over-the-top and although it's based on real events, it isn't depicted believably. It's a good movie, but shows how times have changed so quickly in what passes as believable performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"God's own methane","review":"This is such a great movie and it still seems to have a pretty fervent following. It's obviously a pretty twisted high school film. Like Over the Edge, it has staying power.

A must see for any fan of disturbing films with bits of comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The anti-80s film","review":"The Bottom Line:This unique teen film from the 80s focuses on a group of friends who find one of their number murdered...and then mill around without calling the police or showing any sign of remorse or disapproval; a distinctly interesting study of teen anomie, River's Edge is imperfectly put together but much more thought-provoking than the Pretty in Pinks and Breakfast Clubs of the world.3/4"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books on this subject.","review":"I tried recipes from this book and they are awefull.

And the rest is history. That script turned out to be The Men. Brando is Bud, a parapoliegic shot in WWII and recovering in a veterans hospital. Unfortunatly there is no hope for Bud ever walking again, a fact he refuses to except. This movie is an interesting character study. Brando shows here why he would become the most influential actor of the last half century. He briliantly depicts a man at tremendous odds with himself. The supporting cast of characters, Teresa Wright(Bud's love interest), the doctors, and the men in the hospital, are well cast. Fans of character driven dramas and Brando fans should get a kick out of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But...","review":"If you have never used a metal lathe before, it has some useful info.

In addition, the routine being explained was more of a dance routine than what I consider to be an exercise routine. The video is just sitting on the shelf unused now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"Like the other review I think this is a poorly executed DVD. However, on the flip-side, I felt that there wasn't enough instruction. You were pretty much expected to already know the moves and what was coming up to be able to execute the routine. There was no breaking down of the moves so you could learn them. I did about 20 minutes before I gave up.

Upon hearing the CD, I became a fan, and no one's voice in my 21 years has touched my soul the way such tracks as \\"You Are My Friend\\" and \\"Change is Gonna Come\\" have. If Patti simply released live recording after live recording for the rest of her career, I will be one happy young man. So deeply am I inspired by Patti's sheer artistry that New Year's Eve last, I chose to have my own \\"countdown\\" with Patti--with my earphones on, I welcomed to my heart Patti's \\"I Believe\\" in hopes that it would have an effect on my singing soul for the remainder of the year.

When someone constantly doesn't listen, you would think they would do something about it. Ninian just kept repeating herself and Drogo just never listened. I also didn't like the fact that Drogo treated Ninian, even when he found out she was prego with his baby. The relationship was just too forced. There was no attraction build up. It was just too flat and too many characters to follow.I only read a third of the book and skipped to the end. The end wasn't anything special either.

I like to just walk in place to get warmed up then scoot along to the other sections. The buns and thighs sections I haven't even been able to finish yet because they are sooo difficult. That's good. A challenge is always welcomed! So, Pros: Great workouts for ABS, Thighs and Buns. Cons: Bad Cues for warmup and is more difficult than it leads on.

I like the Three 10 minute sessions the best, but the 30 minute aerobics are very weak. Denise jumps around on the lawn for 30 minutes, and it seems like she's just making up things to do. It's not that bad really, but I guess that the quality of the whole dvd (which must have been a video transfer) makes it seem worse than it is (maybe?).

For one thing...the DVD will constantly stop, like someone has hit pause...then start back up. This could be my particular copy.Additionally, Denise just goes off in her own world on the \\"fat burning\\" section. She does nothing to explain the movements beforehand, just breaks out in dance steps/routine. I hate this section. So basically, you have to watch this section 10 times before you can even learn what she's doing. I don't want to do this. I want the routines to be easy and simple and some minor explanation beforehand (ex. we're going to do this...then show us slowly...then speed up) She doesn't do that.The other sections: abs, buns, thighs are ok.Overall, I would not recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"try it if you realy like her","review":"I never use this DVD anymore - mostly because I hate Denise's style, all the sugary positive talk makes me nuts.

The movie is filmed in black and white to remind us nothing is simply black and white. The Towers home is a surreal, sterile atmosphere with winding staircases that remind us of the twisted reality of this family.Two brothers meet for the first time at their father's funeral. The acknowledged son is rich in money but totally lacking in warmth and has no friends. Apparently he also lacks a conscience. The other son is a poor blue-collar worker but a caring, warm person who easily makes friends. There is much talk in the film about the brothers looking so much alike and yet they look nothing alike physically.

I was hoping for discussion of pressure points (none), perhaps some locks/breaks (none), or even a bit of comparison between this and Okinawan Karate.

The devotionals are easy to read and my husband and I have definitely come back to things we've read about when we've had arguments.

Great songwriting, great voice, nice acoustic. Much more folk than pop/rock, especially in terms of song depth. Whole album is worth listening to. First album I've bought by a guy in a long time (and would have never heard of him but saw him live last night opening for Sinead Lohan).

I tried to hear Arvella on Maxwell Street, but despite what it said in The Reader, he wasn't playing that one day I had set aside to try and catch him. Although the first love petered out, the true love is still there, and I recently came across this cd. Admittedly after the first track made me think that I had stumbled onto the wrong Blind Arvella Gray, the cd just picked up from there--the songs get more bluesy, the slide work more gutsy, and the experience made me glad that this lifetime gave me enough days to finally hear Arvella sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gay, Straight, who cares?","review":"I had the privilege of seeing this movie for the first time on the cable channel BRAVO in 1987 or 1988. That was when they didn't edit movies or have commercials. Imagine if they edited this movie for the general public? I am not gay or homophobic. I didn't even think about sexual preferences outside of the context of the movie. I just thought it was a very well written and acted movie. And it was the best thing Mrs. Roper has done since. I recorded it because I had a feeling it wouldn't be one of those \\"Back to the Future\\" type of movie that you could dial up every other week. I was right. It also had one of the best sound tracks. And not just the music itself. It was the way the music was dovetailed in with particular scenes. I wish it would come back or at least be available to rent. Also a very good time period movie. Given the time and place, the situation would have been risky indeed. One of the best movies you won't be able to see for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I wasn't expecting much from this film when I ordered it.

The new version also allows you to watch the movie with the directors comments played through-out.

A must watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Lesbian Cinema","review":"This is one of the best lesbian films ever. The acting is first rate. The script is great.

This one must be added to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still THE Classic","review":"If you haven't seen it - consider getting it. If you have, now it's on DVD for your library. It's still the classic of all. For anybody who likes a little romance [even if it sounds \\"to good to be real\\"], the possible late bloomer, or just the \\"seasoned\\", but also for the \\"young and restless\\".

One of the few.Better than \\"Kissing Jessica Stein\\" or \\"Better Than Chocolate\\" in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding movie","review":"This movie posessed everything I expected and more. For once a lesbian movie with a positive outcome. Helen Shaver and Patricia Charbonneau performance is outstanding. They truly are opposites of one another. They posess a ten year age difference. These two unlikely women would eventually fall in love with one another. The love scene between these two women was very hot and passionate and left me with a feeling of \\"wow how wonderful\\". This movie was very well directed by Donna Deich.I am glad I just found this movie (this movie was origionally released in 1985) because this DVD contains: Two-Disc Vintage Collection that features interviews with these two actors by the director and how the love scene was filmed.This is definitely a must have movie in your movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I love Desert Hearts. It was the first lesbian movie I saw and it was highly recommended by a lesbian friend. I like the fact that there is an age difference between the two women as I can relate to that in my life.

I have seen several L films, and what characterizes them is that although the story may be great, the acting skills are rather poor. Not so in this case.

I really hope that I can understand the whole story and know exactly every word what the casts are saying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"The film was okay. I would not recommend buying it, but it's okay to rent. Vivian Bell (Helen) and Patricia Charbonneau (Cay) gave strong performances as the \\"professor\\" and the \\"wild card\\" who fall in love. The shy glances exchanged between them were sexy and natural. Also, the slow, intimate sex scene was very erotic, even more so because the director chose to eliminate a musical backdrop and focus on the two women's passionate breathing. Audra Lindley (Frances) also turned in a strong performance as Cay's alcoholic stepmother. Some of the supporting characters were weak (especially Cay's best friend) and some of the lines were lame. But overall, a good effort for a first-time director.I'm sure Deitch will turn out much better cinema in the future. Final advice: Rent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"A truly enjoyable movie once you get past some of the corny lines and scenes. Both women are just beautiful for their time and I loved the transformation of Helen's character because I could relate personally.

(most of user reviews here are truly great and insightful!)If you watched the original release in theater, you would notice that dvd version is a little shorter. About 5 minutes shorter. Yes they cut off part of the love scenes where Vivian and Cay made love in hotel for the first time.I read one of the reviews here that mentioned brief love scene, and this is why. It is a little disappointed that the dvd version is not a completed one.Although this movie is still great regardless, I still would like to see the full-length movie in future dvd or VHS version.By the way if you like Desert Heart, you may like these too :Lianna, Tipping the velvet, boys dont cry, all about my mother, and ma vie en rose. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie!","review":"I have loved this movie ever since it came out in the theaters in, I think it was 1986.

A real period piece too, and man, if they had made a soundtrack of the movie it would be one of my favorite albums! Lots of great period music including Patsy Cline, Jim Reeves, Patti Page and many more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but one of the best available","review":"Ok, so it's a low budget film and some folks feel the plot could have been developed better. Even so, it's an unflinching adaptation of the novel by Jane Rule and a better film than many others with bigger budgets that get much more exposure. Besides, it's simply a pleasure to watch. After seeing \\"The Color Purple\\" and \\"Fried Green Tomatoes\\" I could only hope that the films were enough to lead viewers to get the books on which they were based and read the real stories. After watching \\"Desert Hearts\\" I felt the \\"real story\\" of the novel had been told, though I still strongly recommend the book. Kudos to Donna Deitch for working so hard to bring this to us.

It even has diagrams of the body, facial features, bone structure, and the different systems. Although it shows the reproductive organs, there is no maternal diagrams (or any with a baby).For people starting Spanish, I suggest a beginner's dictionary first. Some words and slang you may not use in a hospital may not be listed. But words such as spider, gunshot, and house are translated (since someone could have a bug-bite or bullet wound).This is great to look at.I highly recommend this to those using Spanish in a Medical field.

He also had bad things to say about Emperor Dom Pedro II, who was mainly overthrown because of his decree ending slavery.

My favourite track has to be 'Melinas Revenge' which contains music from the pre-title helicopter sequence, which is truly excellent. 'Submarine' is also an inspired track. Track 13 has the superb gun-barrel introduction theme, which is rare as most James Bond soundtracks fail to include the famous opening to this film series.

And was there ever a novel as funny as Lucky Jim? Read this book and you'll know why critic William H. Pritchard named it one of the five funniest books written this century (along with Evelyn Waugh's Decline and Fall and Anthony Powell's From a View to a Death). No one was better than Amis at mercilessly skewering phonies and mocking the affected, and here his targets not only include academics and academic life, but the artistically pretentious, the enforced boredom of dinner parties, \\"Art with a capital 'A',\\" any male over the age of thirty with facial hair, the tendency of academic women to dress like peasants, \\"filthy Mozart,\\" and--in case he missed anyone--Modernism in general. With targets like these, how could one not enjoy the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest novel I've read in years.","review":"I picked up this book in the library while looking for Martin Amis' most recent book. It was a lucky day for me. I can't remember the last book that made me laugh out loud like this. Or the last time my husband (who reads very few novels) tore through a book I recommended.

When I discovered, after I finished the book, that Lucky Jim was written in the 1950s, I realized that Mr. Bean is not an anomaly in British humor, but an institution. Actually, Lucky Jim is better than any Mr. Bean episode."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky Jim now very dated","review":"I bought this book as a nostalgia trip, having read it in my teens almost fifty years ago.It seems very dated now.

It's really good!","review":"I have a tendency to allow my imagination to wander. This was the case when I tried to fly through the book. You have to read it very carefully to not miss what's going on. It took me longer to read it than usual, but if you pay attention, it's one of the best books you will ever read. Especially if you are one who enjoys the psychology of human nature.The British tone and the fact that it was written in 54 with different slang to me made me pay closer attention to what I was reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Penquin Class contains many serious errors","review":"Do not buy the Penguin version of Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. It contains many errors introduced by the new publisher. One ofthe biggest occurs on p. 250. Four lines down is a paragraph where Jim is thinking of which suburb he should live in whenhe moves to London. In the 6th line down, he thinks to himself \\"Belgrave Square, Wapping, Chelsea. No, not Chelsea.\\"The error is here and it is huge. The correct version should read: \\"Belgrave Square, Wapping, Bloomsbury. No, not Bloomsbury.\\"What makes this error so huge is that Bloomsbury was the favorite enclave of London's writers. So, Jim is refusing to livewhere the writers live, and hence Amis, the author, through Jim's thinking, is taking a swipe at all the pretentious authorsin London. This is a very funny line for those keenly interested in Lucky Jim. It is also a bit of an in-joke. This is all destroyedby Penguin's version which uses Chelsea. There are many other errors, too.

Which is why I'm down with my mother, my older brother, and everyone else who doesn't personally care for MTV or \\"trash music\\" at all.

Most of the book is taken up with Dorn's fight against the I.W.W., a socialist labor force that's backed by German money. (A double whammy as the two things America hated most at this time was Germany AND socialists!) It's not until the last third or so of the book that Kurt goes off to war. Author Zane Grey, through his fictional character, is able to go off on a tangent about American women going ga-ga over a uniform and throwing themselves at men. (Like that's never happened before.) Once in the trenches of France, Dorn - who had been so anxious to go kill Germans - suddenly realizes the evils of war and the wrongness of wholesale slaughter. Not that that stops him from killing a few Germans anyway.Count how many times the word \\"wheat\\" is used in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature, incohesive","review":"I caught DJ Spooky while in DC last fall. The show was fairly entertaining, so I figured I'd give Riddim Warfare a try. In general I'm not huge fan of hip hop, but do listen to a fair amount of electronica, trip hop, ambient, etc. In general I feel this album falls short compared to European counterparts such as Tricky, although I'm not sure this a fair comparison. DJ Spooky is not as intelligent as he wants you think he his. Many of his ramblings make no sense to me what so ever. Plus there are just to many Atari samples. Seriously I think there should be a limit on the number of Space Invader samples per recording -- 2 or 3 sounds good. I believe Atari could make a case for claiming royalties from this album. I found this work pretty immature."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get what people see in this????????","review":"I don't get why people like this music, I only got the album because it was .25 cents. I thought I would give it a try, but it's just not for me, I don't even know how you can call some of the tracks on this album \\"music,\\" I would just call it sounds. The only track that I liked was \\"It's nice not to lose your mind\\" but the track is phased from one side of the speakers to the others so you can't even hear the beat so it sounded terrible. I don't mean to be close minded or sound like I am hating on this album but this is just my honest reaction to it. But, by all means if you are a person who enjoys this album, more power to you. Just not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overexpirimentationalism","review":"I am largely disappointed with this album. Some of the reviews I have read hailed DJ Spooky's attempt to conjoin multpile genres with his expirimental style, but to me the result is an an incoherent bravado of noise. The only enjoyable tracks are those featuring guests such as Kool Kieth and Sir Menelik, but between Spooky's silly pseudo-intellectual music-science rationalizations and his overly filtered effects, it sounds less like music and more like someone having fun with a mixing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will the real DJ Spooky stand up?","review":"Though I'm always looking for interesting, innovative electronic music, I have resisted DJ Spooky for a while. Mainly because what I heard from him prior to Riddim Warfare sounded like someone tuning their ham radio while practicing their bass down the hall from any microphones. But (his pompous theorizing aside) I wanted to like him. And I figured Riddim Warfare might be my window into his work. It was on a major label. Hell, he was even working with rappers. Well, unfortunately, Spooky's still a work in progress. Despite a few interesting tracks, Riddim Warfare is all over the place. It's drum n' bass, it's Brazilian music, it's underground rap, it's reggae, it's pompous theorizing! All of this with no strong unifiying purpose. And unfortunately, he still drops into that annoying \\"illbient\\" vaporousness. I'm all for artistic diversity.

However, Ron Carlson has produced his own quirky \\"magic\\" with some of his stories in The Hotel Eden. Carlson looks at us and then writes stories about our behavior. So what? Most writers can do this OK. The difference for Carlson's stories may lie in his grace of how carefully he looks at us and reads between the lines of our everyday behavior. What we may get from his stories is something more funny or more sad than we ever knew. Good--honest writing with little artifice or fill."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is absolutely aces.","review":"The stories in this book are horribly fun to read. Ron Carlson has a really cool sense of humor. As a college student, it is important to read material that excites your spirit, to even out the Calculus and Accounting.

It is full of moronic humor and the character of Stiffler is the dumbest, most obnoxious and moronic character ever written and performed to that level by a very poor actor. But I guess every generation needs it Porky's so, have at it. Its got a few good laughs all of them sophomoric. The first one is the best of the three and worth watching.

Anyways i seen the three disc box set on Amazon for dirt cheap used and decided to re-live these movies. My first opinion is these movies are still funny years down the road now, my second opinion is they are better watched back to back v.s. waiting and watching all these movies seperately. I watched all three on my Friday evening back to back and had a hoot. Im not going to go into a detailed breakdown of these movies, chances are youv already watched them.

I looked at the cover and thought, \\"Ok, this looks interesting. My type of story.\\" Then I said, \\"Oh, you wrote this.\\" Yes, I work with James Othmer at Y&R.; I expected The Futurist to be pretty decent, I knew Jim to be an intelligent guy. But I must say, I was a bit surprised by how much I liked it. It's a really fun read. The characters are both vivid and mildly absurd and the situations are often comically over the top.If you're looking for a read that will make you laugh and shake your head at the human condition, and you enjoy your stories with a touch of gonzo, The Futurist is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Social Satire","review":"The book's writing makes it move along at an international pace. But its greatest strength is social satire. It is a commentary on globalization, and the corporatizing of everything, from war to terrorism to the publishing world. It's funny, but agenda funny. Radically, anti-corporate actually. Not for everyone, but if you're politically minded and can laugh about really horrible things, it's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cynical, lightweight fun","review":"This is a quick and engaging read that is at turns--somewhat disconcertingly--cynical and sincere. As a consultant myself, I appreciated the send-up of that most unaccountable of pundits, the futurist.It isn't going to make anyone's \\"Great Literature of 2006\\" list, but it's great for a flight from Chicago to New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Future of Novels","review":"I just finished reading The Futurist and thought it was a great read. The sarcastic humor and smooth writing style really gave the book a nice edge. Besides for that the book really brings a different perspective to a lot of issues going on.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I came into my reading of the THE FUTURIST expecting witty, biting satire, and an overall intelligent send-up of contemporary American Culture, politics, terrorism, media, and everything in between. What I got was a mildly interesting book that was short on wit and any original insight, full of clunky prose, repetitive scenes, a HEAVILY contrived plot, and overall, not very funny. Additionally, the book is already quite lean at 229 pages, and it still felt about sixty pages too long. It reads like a novella, or even a short story, that some editor advised the author to pad to attain novel length. I am a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut, George Saunders, George Orwell, Haruki Murakami, and all the great satirists of our time. This book is a pretender to the throne. Be forwarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting premise falls flat","review":"I was really looking forward to this book based on a review in the Wall Street Journal. The book begins promisingly enough but quickly devolves into a series of unrealistic, outlandish little episodes (some of which are amusing, hence 2 stars instead of 1) without any rationale. Lack of character development is the driving weakness to the book, undermining the credibility of every event. Having read the book, I'd be hard pressed to describe the protagonist's physical appearance, age, professional or personal history. Muddling matters is the 3rd person style of writing which actually 'feels' like the protagonist describing events in the 1st person. If you're looking for a good summer book, try something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"I predicted this book to be well done and it was!","review":"The Futurist is written by a budding Tom Wolfe but with less cynicism and a bit of soul searching. Nevertheless, it is the ice pick in the cake rather than the icing on the cake when the writer dons his scuba gear and flippers and guide us to the deepest bottoms of moral turpitude and brings us to the brink of the surface before our oxygen tanks run out of air. The experience is harrowing enough that the reader would breathe a sigh of relief that even if we almost ended up drowning and floating to the surface with the life and viridity of virals infested turds in a towel bowl, there is alway hope that we could be much, much, more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Read!","review":"The Futurist is a fantastic novel. In today's time of political turmoil, it's a story that we can all relate to in some way, even if you're not normally interested in politics.The Futurist is an entertaining and wonderful read, and Mr. Othmer's writing is brilliant. I can't wait to see what he'll come out with next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"It's hard to read about a main character that you just don't like and enjoy the book at the same time. The main character is such a jerky ... well, jerk, that I just couldn't care about the book. From reviews it's obvious that others did, but this is just not my kind of book. I prefer characters that I don't want to slap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Briefly inventive, but overall disappointing","review":"This should have been a very good book. If you read the blurb, read the plot, or even try to summarize it afterwards, it comes out as a good book.But. The writing style is overly stylized and becomes taxing and dull about halfway through the book. The lack of character development and character insight is frustrating -- as Othmer adds more color and strangeness to his characters throughout the book, he makes them more superficial and unbelievable. And the storyline, such that it is, gets horrendously convoluted before leading everyone to the conclusion that they knew was coming all along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insincere Book","review":"Reading this book reminded me of lots of consultants I have met who state the obvious and then look around a crowded room expecting everyone to applaud them on their breakthrough insights and wisdom. The story of Yates, a futurist suddenly disenchanted by his own hypocricy, just did not do it for me, even if it had bits of interesting sarcasm and irony scattered through the text. Actually I liked the Marjorie character most,the Jo'Berg hooker. Human and even semi-believable. I could not say that for the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak at best","review":"I picked up this book at the library after Borders and USA Today both recommended it. Honestly, I was very disappointed by it. The story goes no where, the characters are one dimensional and as a satire, it needed some MAJOR work. If you want to read good satire, you're better off reading Orwell or Palahniuk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I Ever Read","review":"Intriguing, for the first twenty pages.

A guy gets sick of the BS he gets paid to feed corporate gatherings, and turns on them. As a result, he seems to be more popular than ever. He's a geek, always encouraging companies to take the next step forward in propelling the bleeding edge.But frankly, the guy just wasn't likeable. He comes off as a smartass who spouts off one-liners and bull like it was nothing, but has no redeeming qualities that make you want to root for him.

Ms. Womack has a good voice and puts a lot of energy and emotion in her work.

There is something about this album which will put you in a good mood. BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true beacon in a sea of mindless mush","review":"Along with that of Patty Loveless, Lee Ann Womack's music represents a beautiful island in a sea of \\"Pop goes the country\\" mush, especially among contemporary female artists. Her pure Texas/country voice combined with excellent, real-country, material is a welcome relief to the crud that is currently coming out of Nashville under the guise of country music. Please stay true Lee Ann (Womack), avoid the commercial track, embarrassing videos, and promoters that will take you from us.

The complex family relationships and glimpses of the brothers' past kept me enthralled, while the one-liners had me laughing out loud and looking for ways to add them into my own conversations. Horror elements are present in each episode and sometimes they are downright scary, but the real draw is the fine acting by the two young leads. While Dean and Sam could have been made stereotyped, cardboard characters, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki flesh out their nuances - many times with only a look. I would strongly urge those who like their family drama mixed with comedy and a little something else to purchase these DVD's. You won't be disappointed.

What annoys me the most is the sloppy impersonation carried out by the two brothers (main characters) in the show. In all 4 episodes of disc 1, they impersonated all kinds of people such as FBI agents, ATF, etc. They even used fake credit cards! And all they got was a slap on their wrists! This makes the show more like a comic book. Many times, it's so illogical that it's silly funny! There's no seriousness at all.The qualities are not even. Only 2 out of 4 episodes of disc 1 have some frightening moments. They're Pilot, and Phantom TravelerI finished watching only disc 1 of season 1. I did not watch the others because it's more like a horror comedy to me.

If you like ghoulies and ghoasties and demons and pretty blokes killing 'em, you'll love this. My 16-year old daughter says it's the best thing on TV. We got the Season One boxset in two parts in the UK and neither came with any extras. The US version (Region 1) was much better equipped and all in one glorious package (her words, not mine. I think she means the DVDs, although she could be refering to Jensen Ackles), so if you've got the Region 1 version, don't get suckered into getting the brace of Region 2 disks as you'll be disappointed.Good harmless fun, if you like demon hunting and stuff.

I knew Jensen Ackles from his one season on Smallville, and honestly I wasn't that into his role as Jason on that show. I thought the idea for two ghostbusting brothers sounded kind of dumb, but I watched the premier anyway, and I have been hooked ever since. Dean's smart-a$$ mouth, the Impala, and the excellent plots keep things lively. They come up with some very imaginative and clever plots, not just hunting down and killing another ghost each week. This show can be really unpredictable; just when you think you know what's about to happen, it goes in a totally different direction. I feel this show is one of the most underrated and unfairly neglected shows on tv.

The story arcs are ingenious and the plots within the plot bring new spins with every episode. The relationship between the brothers is challenged and strengthened as one episode goes to another. The urban legends explored in each show are entertaining and brings new life to old stories. They have many legends that people have never heard of before, and some legends that are infamous. This mix keeps the show interesting and addictive."},{"rating":"2","title":"First season wins","review":"If you are interested in the hardy boys and buffy the vampire slayer this is the series for you. love the characters and the story line. does not disapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I am ecstatic with the Blu-ray DVD of SUPERNATURAL'S first season and thrilled at the discount I got through Amazon.

Anyone who enjoys science fiction, should enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbest!","review":"I love Supernatural ( all seasons). I wait and watch every week.

All the wonderful classic rock songs have been replaced with awful random songs that completely ruin the atmosphere of the show.There is no warning that the music has been changed - I was completely unaware of the substitutions until I actually watched an episode. I think it is completely unethical of Amazon not to warn its customers that these episodes do not contain the same music as the broadcast and DVD versions. DO NOT PURCHASE THESE EPISODES ON VOD - do yourself a favor and go buy the REAL Season 1 (with awesome music) on DVD.Supernatural - The Complete First Season"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Supernatural...","review":"You will obviously love the DVDs.

Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles had immediate chemistry, and watching their relationship build is one of the pleasures of SPN. You also get Padalecki's auditioning reel, which shows he nailed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this series","review":"Supernatural is a series that takes unexplained phenomena and family to a whole new level. The characters are well developed and draw you into the story. This season follows the lives of Sam and Dean Winchester through their search for their father who is also in search of something. Through their journey they come across many evil things that need be exterminated and these boys are just the ones to do it. In the end they find their father and meet up with an evil they have longed to meet as long as they could remember... their mothers killer. The only thing about the season that is hard to stomach is the cliff hanger at the end! All in all a great series and a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"The price of season two was bumped up 3 times. I will by DVD for now on. Supernatural was great.

I was not able to watch all of season one, when the episodes first aired, so it was great to be able to watch them on dvd and get ready for the new season.

The individual episode plots aren't necessarily badly written but the show couldn't be more insipidly conservative and dull if it tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO REDEEMING VALUE OR CREATIVITY","review":"I will probably get flamed for saying this, but this series is unfulfilling and lacks any attempt at subtlety or originality. The jokes and dialogue are not particularly insightful, witty, nor relevant - Seinfeld or Friends would be more comical in the same premise. It is not curiously ambiguous and thought provoking the way X-Files was. Rather, it is two dull half-wits wound up in illogical and unbelievable adventures. This is a flat, tedious show as far as I am concerned... but perhaps I was never really into the genre (Charmed, Buffy, etc.). Perhaps compared to those, it fits comfortably among them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disks created poorly","review":"The show is great.

I was hooked by the reviews and, since I have the ability to suspend belief, was excited by the prospect of becoming engaged with this one. But I found nothing of value here. Poor writing. Cheesey acting. Complete formula stuff. No depth or complexity in the plotting or the characters. Completely idiotic moments.Now, I could only watch 4 episodes, so maybe it improves.Not one piece of corn in this dung heap.

If more episodes was like Asylum, i think it would've been better.I will not see a episode of this show anymore. I heard this show was influenced by The X-Files.

In My Opinion","review":"I love this show. Each episode has a wonderful story line. The actors ( Jared & Jensen) are also very hot! The thing I like about this show is the family dynamics. You can really tell that the brothers really care for each other. You can tell that the father cares for his kids. I can't wait until the DVD set comes out! And I can't wait until season 2!!! Jared and Jensen deliver brillant performances on this show! Good job guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show. Fast shipping. Pleased custumor.","review":"I was so pleased when I got my copy of Supernatural's first season. If you're a fan front the beginning or you've just become interested in the series, this would be a great addition to your DVD library. Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki, and Jeffrey Dean Morgan do a terrific job of playing the Winchesters. Supernatural is a great mixture of humor, drama, and scary moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural, Season 1","review":"I really enjoyed the first season of Supernatural, two brothers looking for their father after he disappears during a hunt (the bond between the father, John Winchester, and the two sons, Dean and Sam, is that they hunt down any supernatural being that they find killing people, and attempt to kill it). The series starts out with Sam as an infant and Dean about two years old and their mother is killed in the nursery by a demon in front of the father. I find the premise of every episode very interesting with the fact that the brothers never know what they are actually going after and usually have to make up solutions on the fly while still bickering like two brothers would.My only reservation about the disk set is the quality. There are some episodes that causes my DVD to slow up and stop altogether. Hopefully I just got a fluke copy so everybody else can enjoy this well thought out and exciting series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome series!","review":"This is one of my all time favorites!

This first season that started it all. You won't be disappointed with this series. Plus it has Jensen and Jared. What more needs to be said."},{"rating":"2","title":"supernatural - season 1","review":"i really enjoyed this box set. I am an avid fan and loved the way that this series built and in particular the developing bond between the two brothers. The English box set did not come with the added bonuses so I purchased it from America where I enjoyed the added footage.I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a little horror - complete with two sexy guys who work and interact well together - along with Urban Legends which seem to be popular. This series has everything in it. I have not enjoyed a series so much since I was a child. I hope it goes for a good few seasons as I am enjoying season two at the present time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best show on TV","review":"I am from England and had not really been very interested in this show when I first heard about it. I saw the adverts and didn't think it was anything special. However, I was bored and tuned in to the pilot episode only to become totally hooked. I have not missed an episode since.I love the dynamic between the two brothers and it is that that keeps me watching. Both Jensen Ackles (Dean) and Jared Padalecki (Sam) just are the characters.I recently purchased the Region One DVD, simply because I was fed up with the fact that over here we had no special features. I was very impressed with the prompt delivery. It arrived a week before the earliest delivery date! The special features were definately worth the wait. I look forward to seeing the second series when it starts over here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stories - fun show!","review":"I really enjoy this different take on all the urban legends / ghost stories, etc. I feel that the show really draws you in with both the characters, Sam and Dean, and the plot lines.

I think I broke the pause button on the remote, and now I've moved towards the pause button on the DVD player itself! Can everyone say -slow motion! What a treat for me (birthday gift) and now my fiance understands what all the hub-bub is all about. He enjoys the storyline (great fights and gorgeous girls), and I enjoy the good looks and charm (of the main men, of course)! He was able to catch up, so when we watched Season 2, he was all set.

A modern day Karl Kolchak but brothers. Good personal dynamics. Only criticism is as the series unfolds, I dont really think they take Hell as seriously as they ought to, making deals w/ the demons. For all that they acknowedge the demons and the forces of Evil, they seem devoid of the concept of the powers of Good, whether it be angels, God, or some sort of diety."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"The isn't one bad thing I can say about this dvd. The special features are great and SUPERNATURAL is simply the best tv series ever created. How can incredibly bad actors be in the spot light but hard working and amazingly talented ones like Jensen Ackles are shoved in the dark amazes me. So to anyone who has second thoughts about this dvd please don't. It's the best way to spend your money, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural, GREAT","review":"I accidently came across this show on TV during prime time's rerun season.

I've got the second season pre-ordered."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Quality Review","review":"This series is awesome. If you are a horror fan, this is like a weekly mini movie. The Blu-Ray transfer is horrible though. The dialogue is off....way off to the point that it's not watchable. I own all the other seasons as well and they all play fine. My advice is to watch immediately and judge the audio, not wait months like I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best season of the show!","review":"I think this is the best season of supernatural because it was fresh and new. At this point a show like this had never really been done before."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st Season","review":"It took me the first series to get hooked, but now after watching all of the 2nd season, I'm hooked. These two are great together. I love the story line versus the out-of-order feel of the first season. The first half of the first season was all over the place. I almost didn't finish it. But I kept watching just because I had nothing better to do. By the end, the story line finally settled in, ending the season admirably, stringing me along to the 2nd season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season one. the story begins.","review":"The first season of Supernatural, is a \\"must-see\\" part of popular culture. Anyone who likes comedy, drama and a good old fasion scare, will love supernatural. Sam and Dean are looking for their father, and soon discover what really happened during their childhood, Who killed their mother!?In every episode Sam and Dean must fight a new creature of the night, to make the world a safer place. And the dark and scary mood of the first season is a work of art. The episodes vary quite a bit, in one episode there is a lot of brother drama, in another you will laugh so hard, but what they all have in common is the fact that you will be watching them with the doors locked and the light on. They give you the good old scare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural is Super Great","review":"This show caught me by surprise when a friend suggested it to me. The appeal of the two brothers fighting the bad creatures really stands out. You can really tell the two actors have some kind of brotherly thing going on or just really good friends. It's a must see scary, feel good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this stuff & so do my kids!!!","review":"My kids have always loved DaVinci tortellinis but our local supermarket stopped carrying them several months ago.

While there are only three instruments being played, at times you'll feel surrounded by layers of musical color. The group's mad scientist behind the kit, Dave Stanoch strikes a constant balance between funky groove and thoughtful expression.

The direction is very cramped, intentionally, I think, and with obvious purpose, but it does get a bit dreary after an hour or so. Still, Mamet fans will find plenty to love, here. Amusing, chatty, somewhat oblique comedy, with a dark dramatic intensity that very slowly bubbles up from underneath, creating a startlingly gripping climax."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some plays just should not be turned into films","review":"Some of David Mamet's plays turn out awesome on screen: \\"Sexual Perversity in Chicago,\\" \\"Glengary, Glenross\\". Others, like \\"Oleanna\\" and \\"American Buffalo\\" just drag on. This probably is a great play to see live in a more intimate setting but on screen it is just painful to watch.These are some of my favorite actors, and they have their moments. Dennis Franz goes on a couple of good rants, like when he realizes he got ripped off. But overall this is just too freaking dull.

But, don't let that let you ignore it. This album is full of lush melodies and harmonies ala Jawbreaker, Samiam and Jimmy Eat World. From opening track \\"Katherine teh Grateful\\" on to the end, you can hear the passion and honesty in the lyrics and the depth of their music. The fact that the album was produced by Mark Trombino doesn't hurt them either. Mark's a genious knob-twiddler that can make emotional magic happen for a band in the studio.

I could really speak these helpful phrases after 2 morning commutes. The rest of the chapters are about 3 minutes in length and just go way to fast to understand anything. They are also random situations such as \\"I have a stomach ache\\".From other reviews I read, the $35 or $45 (amazon priced) Pimsleur versions have more of the terrific 30 minute lessons.Although all is not lost, the box does include a helpful phrase card and small booklet of the random conversations on the CD.In my opinion, this just gives you 1, 30 minute audio chapter in hopes you'll buy the larger one. Just save the $10-12 on this and buy the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing; resultant Vedic chart not useful","review":"I was so disappointed. Not nearly as well organized, logically presented, or well-edited (no index either) as the author's \\"The Complete Idiots Guide to Hinduism\\" that I absolutely loved. Instruction sequence (and gaps) makes it difficult to complete even a simplistic Vedic chart. It has undefined terms, continual \\"commercials\\" for websites, unrealistic recommendations for daily practices, unabashed Anti-Republican political agenda, and poor examples of applying even a simplistic chart to real events of daily life.

The whole time i was reading it i kept thinking maybe Audrina was the First and Best Audrina, but then i thought it was too comlicated. Boy was i surprised at the end!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Average Book","review":"I am changing my view of this book. At first I didn't like it but now come to find out the truth behind this novel I enjoyed it 100%. It was sad to see so many people die throughout this novel but in the end Audrina realized that she was needed at this house more than she knew it. I always thought that Vera was Audrina the 1st. Hopefully we'll see more novels like this. The plot kept me in suspense throughtout the whole novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"same ole', same ole' V.C. Andrews","review":"If you've read any of her other books - this is not a whole lot different. Because of the way V.C. writes, I found the story predictable all the way until the very end!! In fact, due to the predictability of her works I have no desire to read any more of her books. She seems to enjoy the same general plot line and simply twists it with each new series. I'm disappointed and have chosen to explore other authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"This is my favorite V.C. Andrews book. It has everything. Murder, horror, love, hope, incest, jealousy, and mystery. The whole time you are reading this book you are on the edge of your seat. I definatley recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story. It is sad at some parts, scary at others, and mysterious all the time. You feel what Audrina feels. When she cries you want to cry. Over all this is a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kid's Review","review":"I'm ten years old and have read books my mother has never even touched.I'm really looking forward to this book because it sounds so exhilarating.I've never read V.C Andrews before and I'm killing to read Flowers In The Attic and since my dad wasn't willing to spend 11 dollars on it I ordered this instead,another novel I wanted to read.I think this going to be a fabulous book.SignedLexi The One and Only"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm, who wrote this?","review":"I completely forgot reading this book until another Amazon reader wrote me with a question which jogged my memory. I read this book after finishing the complete dollanger collection. When I had previously read Garden of Shadows, I remember feeling as if the book had in no way been written by VC Andrews because of the wording and technique. Then when I started reading this book, the same feeling came over me again. I guessed the ending not too far into the book which is not usually the case when reading these books. I have to be honest. I found it boring and couldn't wait to finish it! Even my two teens who had both swiped the Flowers in the Attic series from me with delight, turned their backs on this book after a couple of chapters. I hope the rumor about a 'ghost writer' is not true. Read it yourself and see what you think!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"I read the reviews on this website thinking this book would live up to all the other series that I've loved since a child. But now I see why this book has no companions... because it's by no means in league with the rest. There are only 2 basic plot twists and they're predictable from the very beginning and are hardly as twisted or interesting as most in Andrews' books. It seems like the only reason people on this list are attached to it is because it was the first they read, but it pales in comparison to the Dollanganger or even the Casteel series. So if you don't want to be sitting up all night waiting for something intriguing to happen that never does, buy one of Andrews' others instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"If the main character could do basic arithmetic, this book would have no plot.","review":"This book is hilariously bad! Overwrought and ridiculous, all the suspense is pretty laughable. You just want to push the main character down a flight of stairs after awhile. If you like unintentionally funny books, this one will have you rolling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, this book was terrible","review":"It's not that it's written terribly, it's just that it was incredibly predictable. And the ending was absolutely horrid! I mean, come on, it is SO sending the wrong message to people who may be trapped in an abusive relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is creepy, absolutely creepy","review":"I can't believe how some of the other reviews portrayed this book as good! I was totally creped out by this book! I have been reading VC Andrews for more then 6 years now, and this is by fare the worst one written! I mean, please. Confusing that poor girl about the year, and date and making her think she was crazy? You people call that love!? I wouldn't read this one unless you enjoy feeling creepy at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I just want to say I was very disappointed with this book of V.C. Andrews that I'm afraid to read any more of her's. I didn't like that fact that Audrina's dad had to compare her to the 1stAudrina and also put her in a rocking chair to try and be like Audrina the 1st. I'm also upset to see the way Sylvia turned out. So if I were you I'd not even bother reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Sweet Audrina","review":"At first I was a bit confused about the 2 Audrina's, then as I delved into the book further I understood more and more. I don't want to give the ending away but it is defiiitely worth the read. Very dramatic and rather sad, but very compelling. V.C, Andrews does a great job with this one as well as all the others I have read. I am beginning to feel like somewhat of an addict; good reading. Rita Seavey"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book, Never Forgotten","review":"I read this many years ago, and have never forgot its impact on me. It was interesting, spooky, and sexy. I enjoyed this book alot, and would read it over again if I had a copy on hand! I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dark and haunting","review":"This book is probably the darkest book of all the VC books, even more so than the Dollanganger series. Audrina's character is developed in a very confusing way, so it's a little frustrating when you try to make sense of the book, yet it kept me hooked until the very end. I like how the book takes place in a gothic setting where time seemingly has stopped. It has a great plot and keeps you wondering up until the end of the book. I took off one star because I didn't really like Arden towards the end of the book. He developed into a weak, incompetent guy who was nowhere near good enough for Audrina. And I absolutely HATED the ending of this book!! It was a major disappointment for me. It left me feeling INCREDIBLY sorry for Audrina. Poor girl...after suffering so much...and this is all she ends up with..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like I remember","review":"Except for sound quality in the first episode, everything else including picture quality were fine. A great bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I got this for my 7 and 10 year old boys who are really into Robin Hood now. They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it. However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors. Also the sound is very bad. Some of the plots are a little boring. But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality. I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't. I just wish it was easier to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"I ordered this for a Kindergarten classroom and it's working out great. It's light weight, solid wood and easy to move around. The posts don't stay in well unless you glue them in with wood glue. It literally took 4 minutes to unwrap, assemble and glue. Once glued it is very sturdy and durable. The kids like being able to see, sort and move the puppets around. Plus the price was very reasonable unlike many of the other puppet storage solutions out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what is needed","review":"No one \\"plays\\" with it, but that isn't the purpose. It holds the puppets for the preschoolers nicely. It also doubles as a ring toss. The sticks don't always stay in their holes, so I've considered gluing them, but then they wouldn't be removable for flat storage when not in use. This one has lasted about a year without breaking. I've had others where the sticks broke of at their connection point. It could happen to this one, but no one has been too rough with it yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to your child's \\"library\\"!","review":"What a cute story! Charlie is in charge of little sister Lola and decides to play a trick on her. With Charlie giving silly names to foods that Lola claims she doesn't like, Lola plays along and tastes foods she has insisted she will never, ever eat. My 6-1/2 year old loves this book; it's a bit too old for my almost 3-year old.What I like best about this book are the real photographs of the foods (peas, carrots, fish sticks, etc.) that are incorporated into the fun cartoon illustrations.This is a engaging, slightly offbeat story which makes it stand out from the zillions of other children's books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super book!","review":"It has great pictures, and the book is about a little girl named Lola who is a very fussy eater. Lola learns about fruits and vegetables. Her sister Charlie tells her that they are different things and from different places. Lola tries everything and ends up liking them all. I would suggest this book for kids under the age of 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"My four year old loves it. He's even reading it to himself. But I still can't get him to eat his veggies. I got the book because I knew tomatoes were my son's least favorite food. It is incrediably creative and funny though in traditional Charlie and Lola fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I am very pleased with this book especially since it is a great story that any children would love (my 2nd graders) and was a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would never EVER do without this book!","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter when she was about two. She starts kindergarten this year and it is still a favorite. Kids love it and if you are the designated-reader-of-stories you will too! Lola gives you an excuse to emote to your hearts content. I will keep this book forever (and buy a new one if it falls apart!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book and tv show","review":"I recently started watching a really great cartoon on the disney channel called 'Charile and Lola'.

The characters are lovable, the writing is clever, and the illustrations are so creative!

All the little pull tags were wrinkled and disconnected from the paper and Charlie's head was off. Also on the last page the planets were not connected. I don't know if this is a manufacturing problem or an Amazon problem. I have not found anywhere to ask this question...I don't think I can send it back as it has already been opened, but I do want Amazon to know I am disappointed in this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Christmas gift for my 9-year old niece...Easy order process and quick delivery!Thanks, Thanks, Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie & Lola are a great team","review":"My 6 month old son loves to looks at these books as I read them to him, infact he's enjoyed them from about the age of 3 1/2 months.

Lauren Childs does a wonderful job as usual."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love Charlie & Lola!!!","review":"These books are so great! My 4 year old son loves them all and asks for them to be read to him over and over again.

No doubt that the last track (instrumental)is the most worthy since we are not tortured by the continued one-dimentional focus on failed or troubled relationships. Let's open a clinic for those who feel obligated to provide this theme such high ratings. Bottom Line: Mr. Isaac has tremendous talents. Unfortunately this work is not exemplary of his potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reissue of an Excellent Album","review":"Chris Isaak has such a wonderful voice, he could sing the New York phone book and it would sound great! This was kind of fun to hear some of his earlier work and compare it to his current hits. There are some very good songs on this album, but I think I prefer some of his newer material. Nonetheless, the whole album made it to the iPod (we don't transfer songs we don't like, so that's the ultimate test)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic Issak record!!!","review":"I have most of Chris Issaks CD's, and this one almost ranks up there with my favorite, \\"Forever Blue\\". The songs are a very crafty mix of ballads and rockers. The entire album is excellent, but my favorites include \\"Flying\\", \\"Walk slow\\", \\"Breaking apart\\", and \\"I'm not sleepy\\".

A haunting hard edge tune says \\"please\\" let me hear more. This record is full of melodic catchy pop tunes. \\"Walk Slow\\" and \\"Wanderin'\\" is a indication of that. The title track rocks as Chris shows a little of his angry side. \\"Little Black Flowers\\" digs deep back into Chris' dark side, but with out a doubt one of the most interesting sounding songs on the record. With \\"I'm Not Sleepy\\" if you are not out of your chair rockin' your not human. I thought the grammy nominated \\"Forever Blue\\" record couldn't be topped.

It was a refreshingly classical rock and roll act using the same band format Buddy Holly and the Crickets and the early Beatles utilized: lead, rhythm and bass guitars backed up by a solid drummer in Kenny Dale Johnson playing straight rock. While showcasing his formidable vocal talent as a balladeer, Isaak's recent albums have lacked the pure rock and roll feel of his first albums. The star power and excitement of the band in its early days is gone. Isaak's more recent works - including this one - leave me disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Strikes and 12 more to suffer through","review":"\\"Please\\" and \\"Flying\\" are the only two songs that are worthy of his fame.

It's beautifully illustrated and although the rhymes are not as good as his other books, I just added a few extra words make the cadence sound better. Nevertheless, this book is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"This book is great! The artwork is really nice, simple and colorful. Great rhyming. My son (2) even learned the word \\"help\\" from this book, (finally he asks for help instead of just whining, it was worth every penny just for that sanity). I really like that there is a Jeep in the book because we drive one. It's nice that this book has visual appeal for adults because you will have to read it over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for kiddos","review":"My kids love this book and always ask for it.

Its advertised elsewhere that this unit corrects the ball joint problems (early failure) of the Acura oem unit so I am hopping that will happen. So far its been about five months and it seems to work OK. Also I read in auto web sites that Dorman specializes in identifying problem automobile parts and makes improved replaced parts so that should increases one's confidence in their replacement part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but flawed design","review":"I got this control arm from Rock Auto and put it on my 1996 Accord Lx. It did fit however there were two problems with it. 1. The hole for the cotter pin was drilled way to low. When I torqued the castle nut to 29 foot pounds the hole was completely clear of the hole in the stud for the cotter pin. I had to use 2 m10 washers to make it fit. #2 the damn cotter pin that came with it didn't fit. It would go in but just wouldn't go in all the way. So I ended up having to make a trip to autozone to buy some washers and an assortment pack of cotter pins. Pretty lame design if you ask me. I would just buy a more expensive one that actually works better seeing as you'll have to buy extra stuff anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff..","review":"I have always been a Joe Walsh fan but never bought any of his solo music..

The heavenly choir and prayer-like lyrics had always haunted me, but I never knew the backstory, and then I heard Joe HIMSELF on a radio show recount the story...how he and his wife spent the following year seated on the floor in an embrace, crying for Emma...it's a beautiful tribute capping a strong effort by J.W."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe's Flys are ridiculous fish magnets!","review":"6 of us went to Colorado for vacation this summer to do some serious trout fishing. We've been going for years, and I generally rotate between flys and spinners depending on what's hitting. joe's flys are basically a combo between a fly and a spinner, and with both a treble hook AND a standard hook! There were times I couldn't reel them in fast enough, and the rest of the group wasn't catching squat with everything they tried. I ended up having to share my weapons so they could reap the same benefits, and low and behold they started catching fish as well. Unfortunately I only bought 3 of these, and I'm down to 1 left---so here I am, buying a ton more!

I can't say enough good things about Vee Vee, Greatest of all time, and my favorite, all the nations airports. But this album just...(bad). Really. And take my advice. i hate to admit it, and i tried to get into this because i love every last effort, but this one just sounds disorganized, it's the sound of a band trying to pretend they have heart in the music. But there really isn't too much on here. Never in my life has music given me a headache, but track 7 will give me one every time. This is one archers album to live without."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened??","review":"AOL is my all-time favorite group, but what did they do in White Trash Heroes? The album is correctly named - it's trash. I like heavy guitar, but these songs have no rhythm & almost no guitar. Eric's vocals aren't raspy like their other albums. And Eric's newer group, Crooked Fingers, sound like the White Trash Heroes album. Big mistake. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"and if they were to continue, would we all crumble?","review":"Tightening their music vocabulary from All Nations Airports with keyboards and synths, the archer\`s of loaf\`s latest album (and apparently last) is an unsettling-sometimes meloncholy-often celebratory visit to the old home you grew up in. Normally i would be a bit sad-sad remorseful if a band i loved were slashing its own tires, but with this album a calming peace permeates.

This book, which attempts to be \\"spiritual\\", not only is complete nonsense, since it equates being rich with \\"wisdom\\" but it is filled by the author's egomania. Most of the reviews here were written by the author's press team, which only gave it positive reviews but since I am here to speak the truth, I'll give it a thumbs down.

Blessedly short, it is devoid of any practical exercises or original insights. The author introduces each chapter with the same verse of a psalm on wisdom and shares his dry perceptions in each chapter.If you are interested in a spiritual approach with a strong Biblical flavor, you would be better served by Catherine Ponder books. If you are interested in a non-denominational approach, check out the Abraham series by Esther and Jerry Hicks or versions thereof by Joe Vitale (Attractor Factor) or Lynn Grabhorn (Excuse Me, Your Life is Waiting). Each of these provides a stimulating look at abundance and manifestation and is chock-full of practical exercises and suggestions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the photos at least","review":"The pictures in this book are wonderful and quite inspiring. I would LOVE to knit a nice toy farm set for visiting friend's kids. However, this book won't help you knit a set as wonderful as the one pictured. Many of the patterns are missing vital details, like the pattern for the ears or tail. Additionally, the patterns have been dumbed down from the versions in the pictures. Many of the photographed animals are knit using short rows, yet the patterns are for simplistic animals with log shapes for the body and legs just stitched together to look vaguely like an animal. Kids can make animals just like that by stitching together their icord from their knitting spools!Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with the patterns in this book but still in love with the photos. I intend on giving away the failed animals I made following the patterns in this book and then design my own critters to more closely match those in the photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad to see it has been reprinted!","review":"This is a lovely book with full instructions for making a beautiful rug-hooked playmat of a farmyard and surrounding fields, plus instructions for knitting all the farm animals and a farm family.

Most sugar-free pancake syrups are made with sorbital, which can cause extreme digestive system problems. I found this product and thought we'd finally found something she could use, as it was made with splenda. Watch out folks...this is not pancake syrup, despite what it says on the label. It is a liquid flavoring that is added to coffee drinks. It is watery, slightly sweet, and doesn't taste like maple syrup. We were able to get a refund, but it was because the bottles we got were out of date, not because of the false advertising. The seller, Beverage Gourmet, was absolutely disappointing in their handling of our problem. (The manufacturer, to our surprise, was very helpful but ultimately we had to deal with Beverage Gourmet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential leads to a heavy letdown","review":"Looking at the cast and concept of this film, it's understandable to expect great things. Unfortunately, weak writing and poor direction pushes and pulls this movie in every different direction and down every different rabbit hole. Before long, you find yourself an hour in, mired by subplots you don't care about and then there's a pointless sex scene on a staircase.You're better off watching Gigli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good story line.","review":"This movie was an excellent pick for me for a couple of reasons. For one the plot could have happened to any business owner in the country that had a situation like this happen and plus the news coverage that followed. Second off the story was kept simple and basic, none of the ridiculousness of a typical \\"over the top, fake looking, Hollywood crap-script\\" that most similar movies are about today. Its good choice for anyone on the fence about renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless B-movie","review":"This film is so bad the audience were actually laughing near the end (when Viggo drives hundreds of miles through the night). I can't imagine what Cronenberg was thinking. The story is predictable and dull from the opening (poorly acted by the little girl) scene to Mortensen's detached performance. Without the comic book violence and over the top (and painful to watch) sex scenes this film could be made for afternoon TV. There is nothing deep and meaningful here, if you want to see a good movie watch Crash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Ever","review":"If it were possible for a movie to be rated negative five stars, I'd do it. This was so far past awful, you couldn't even see awful from where this movie was.I had high hopes for the movie since I like many of the people in it. However, the writing is so bad that the talent can't do anything with it.The collection of acting talent, unfortunately, is no more able to become a good movie than a heap of building materials is able to become a house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, this movie was terrible.","review":"I felt that I had to write a negative review upon seeing how many positives there are.Be warned: this movie is not for everyone!I don't have a weak stomach, I'm open to independent films, I like new and interesting story lines, and am not overly sensitive.But this movie was...well, to put it politely, this movie was crap. Honestly, I can't imagine what someone could find in this movie to give it more than 1 star.I'll admit, it started out kind of interesting, but only got worse from there. The son was portrayed in such a cliche role that it made me want to throw up...just a little. Also, I felt the ending was overly predictable. There were 2 random, disturbing sex scenes that just made me think, \\"WHY?\\"Ugh, overall, it was a total waste of my night. I should've stayed home studying and if I had, it would've been a lot more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Also disappointed.","review":"I agree with \\"tomdw\\" and his review.I usually avoid detailed reviews of movies so that I don't have any idea of what's coming when I finally watch it. This was no exception. All I'd heard was that it was a good movie. And for the first half of the film, it had it's moments (although the bad-girl sex theme was a bit overdone). The acting wasn't worth writing home about, but the story seemed to have some potential. That potential was unrealized, however, and the last half of this movie was terribly written, terribly uninteresting, and left the film completely flat when it ended.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great twists","review":"While there are other movies better, this one got you involved and interested in the plot. You had the chance to identify with the characters and have empathy for them. The ending caught me off guard."},{"rating":"1","title":"great title, movie doesn't live up to it","review":"Cronenberg made some truly cool cult films in the late 70s and early 80's, very quirky and disturbing ones. this movie is relatively straight forward, the only scene that was eye opening was the uncomfortable sex scene on the stairs which was very original and scary.Overall tinged with disappointment, a little too self aware and should of been much bolder - but good for \\"mainstream\\" movie I suppose!worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"What makes a good movie?","review":"I wanted to see this because of the reviews and because of the preview. What you get is 90 slow minutes. It takes a while for the movie to get interesting, and after the climatic scene it goes downhill. I realize there's a message to the film, but without a good plot line to back up the message you have a really boring movie. Violence and blood does not a good movie make.History of violence turned out to be a real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely hated it","review":"I only give this 2 stars because of Viggo Mortenson. I think he is very talented but even he couldn't elevate this stinker of a movie. Nothing in this thing made real sense to me, especially the overly graphic and prolonged sex scenes which added nothing to the movie itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maria Makes it a 2 Star Movie.","review":"If you want to see someone boring on the screen then you will love this movie. Viggo Mortensen should never be allowed to be in a movie, unless it is for those that are sleep deprived.Maria gives the movie it's only zest.If not for her this movie would be a 1 star.The Story is just boredom interlaced with some quick violence,followed with more boredom and some more very quick violence, then a very contrived and ridiculous ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again........","review":"This movie is a joke, actually almost an insult. The characters are thin, the plot is as simple as black and white and the holes in the overall storyline are as big as black holes in space.

Overall: GARBAGE."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst film I've seen in a LONG time...","review":"Any good review you see on here (as suggested by someone else who didn't like this movie)is a total fake.There is no possible way anyone could think this was even close to a 2star film. Either they are working for the director himself, or they have some unhealthy fan obsession with him, that they will blindly like anything he puts on screen. This was such an amateur flick, I can't believe I waisted my time finishing it. I was ready to shut if off after the first 10 minutes, the cheerleader uniform was a foreshadowing scene of the cliche crap to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"No beast so fierce...","review":"One of the best and most compelling films this year, it seriously illuminates the violence inside of us, particularly repressed and past violence, and the force it has when unleashed.This is about small town Tom, who has a \\"perfect,\\" \\"sleepy\\" life in semi-rural middle America, until some unscrupulous characters appear and propel him into life shattering violence.This is very well acted and directed, the pacing and fury of the violence, the relationship between husband and wife, father and son, brother and brother are all taut and tensely visceral.It excels as a social drama, as a pulp-noir-domestic-drama, and smart action film."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh my, so - so bad...","review":"I never write reviews...after seeing this movie last night - I just had to say something. Whoever is putting good reviews on here (the reason I watched) is obviously working for the movie in some way...there is no way someone with an IQ of average intelligence would say this is in anyway a good movie. Such bad acting, ridiculous hole-ridden plot, so predictable. I laughed many, many times at the acting - and just insultingly amateur dialog.Don't pay a dime for this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie fails mainly because of dialogue","review":"The dialogue in this movie is very very dull. Its like the characters in this movie don't know what to say. Tom and Edie Stall are supposed to be a couple that has been married for 20 years? Joey and Richey Cusack are supposed to be brothers? Leland and Billy are supposed to be partners in crime? Jack and Tom Stall are supposed to be father and son? The dialogue isn't real or imaginative; just bad (or the opposite of original)."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad, bad...","review":"I am convinced the long, drawn out positive reviews flooding this review board are done by people who are associated with this film in some way...they HAVE to be. This was a terrible, terrible film. Worst plot and acting I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful...","review":"I like viggo, but this was just awful. The acting was awful. The dialogue was awful. The required amount of belief that needed to be suspended was tremendous (it was not all that plausible a plot). Pacing could have been better. This was a huge disappointment for me, and I'm still shocked that this got rave reviews in various places. Really, a bad, bad movie. BTW, it has nothing to do with the violence. I don't mind violence :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutally Overrated","review":"I came into this movie expecting something engrossing and overall very rewarding, based on the word of what others have said about it. What I saw could only be called a mess. While I think Cronenberg is at many times a competent filmmaker, this is very much a terrible film. My biggest problem with it stems from the wife. She brings an unneccessary and ridiculous level of drama to every scene she's in, and really distracts from the plot. I wouldn't say that the film drags at any part, but what it does is ignore the aspects that would be the most interesting to the viewer. I was left wanting a lot more fight sequences, and possibly more interaction with the sheriff. It's sad that him and the brother were pushed aside in the story, as they could've in my opinion, saved the film from being a trainwreck. Bottom line, if you want to watch a good Cronenberg movie, give this a pass and check out some of his older stuff like Videodrome."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT FILM! NOT JUST ANOTHER ACTION THRILLER!","review":"This movie surprised the H E L L out of me! Great action, but much more below the surface going on.

The DVD transfer is very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I rented this film after reading that many critics had labeled this one of the best movies of the year. I whole-heartedly disagree. The movie is overly violent, which is fine if that is your thing. Other than that the movie really didn't have that much to offer. The family dynamic really doesn't work - with Tom Stall's family or with his long lost brother. I was flat out disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie for the Pervert","review":"If you are a rapist, you will get off on this movie. If you like hurting children, this movie is one that you should add to your collection. If you have absolutely NO sense of humor, and like to sit through movies without any comic relief, then, trust me, this movie is for you.One of the first scenes is a four or under child being shot while the killer is talking to her in this soothing voice. Another scene has Viggo raping his wife, and she is responding avidly to this wild abuse.I bought this movie thinking that it would have a little bit of violence and some comic relief. I thought, that with names like Ed Harris and William Hurt, you can't lose. I lost.Let's not forget how the dumb sherrif just fell into the plot like a schmuck.Hint: Save your money. If you don't take my word for it, rent it before you buy...guaranteed...you won't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"The script and acting were horrible.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This movie was a complete waste of time. I was drawn to the big names in the movie and figured it would be interesting but I was sorely dissappointed. The dialogue was pathetic and the acting was laughable. I can only shake my head in wonder at how a movie like this gets produced. There wasn't any portion of this movie grounded in reality. The plot was an empty shell that made a hollow march towards an idiotic ending. The only reason I'm writing this review is to save someone else the time and money this farce cost me and hopefully make the world a slightly better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely made it through","review":"I hardly made it through this movie. I love Viggo Mortensen, and that's the only reason I stuck with it. The acting was sub par and left a LOT to be desired. Everyone was very monotone and inexpressive. The plot had the potential to be interesting, but wasn't followed through with. The soundtrack also was uninteresting and didn't really add to the film. If you want an interesting action movie, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even a rental","review":"All I knew about this film was what I saw in the trailers. It seemed like an interesting story with good actors. I also wanted to see it because it had gotten so many good reviews.After watching it, I no longer have faith in movie critics or their reviews. This was an awful movie. I knew there would violence (says so right in the title) but gave little to no warning about the graphic sexual content. The cheerleading encounter and the scene on the stairs was completely over-the-top and inappropriate. Rape and oral sex are not things that should just be tossed in when the story slows down.The only part of the movie I semi-enjoyed was the scene where the geeky son beats up the high school bully.Don't waste your time on this movie. But if you do, you've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too simple, dont really care for the characters","review":"I was disappointed with this film, very messy direction and misplaced scenes. If you really p*ssed the mob off they would just come and whack you(at least according to most mob involved movies). Contained token subplot I would expect of a straight to video release that had no context in the movie. This movie had no identity if that makes any sense. One Sopranos episodeeasily beats this film hands down and doesnt rely on gore or full frontal nudity for cheap thrills. Good films rely on good casting. Had me hanging in to the end for the wrong reason, I was expecting something amazing to happen, all a waste of time. Expected better from this director. Save your time and give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK film","review":"I missed this when it first came out and had only seen pieces of it on TV but remembered that it was well reviewed so when I found a cheap copy of it I decided to take a chance. I was able to watch it all and not be too turned off so I guess it was OK, very violent and a sex scene that seemed pretty weird and a little gratuitous.Certainly not for children and probably not for a lot of adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"A History of Violence (David Cronenberg)","review":"David Cronenberg's \\"A History of Violence\\" has become of my favorite movies of the decade so far. The sex scene between Mario Bello and Viggo Mortensen on the staircase has all but become legendary. Just watching it makes my back hurt. That must have been so uncomfortable but still sexy. The great thing about having this DVD is that you can watch the scene over and over.The story is very simple but really effective. A man hiding his identity is found out by the thugs he is hiding from, just because of an act of bravery which got him on TV. They come and try to destroy his new life. Really not bad. I don't know why so many people don't like this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was really waiting to see this movie when it came to dvd cause I didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters. I heard everyone say how great it was, so I figured it must be really good...I was wrong. This movie was a big let down, from the very awkward rape scene to the stupid ending. I just don't know what these other critics are seeing. I would have liked the movie 10 times more if the story was about tom and his family being part of the witness protection program. I just thought the whole thing with him trying to get himself outta the mob was lame. The only really good thing about this movie was william hurt, who had the best lines in the whole movie. But, other than that...the movie was lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Weird...","review":"I was so excited about seeing this movie. It was so bad. The plot was ridiculous, the over-the-top sex was unnecessary. When the credits starting rolling at the end I sat there wondering what I had just watched. Silly is the word that comes to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, but missed the mark","review":"Not a very well written movie. The concept was good. I think Ed Harris should've been the main antigonist. The whole movie just fell flat. It spent too much time in the beginning trying to portray him as a loving family man. We got the idea early on. They didn't have to keep feeding it to us!!! And to be honest with you, the parts are pretty predictable. The problem is that the movie tried to tell the story of the son as well, but, that's the problem. It took you another direction, but didn't finish where it started. So, the story concept was interesting, but the deliverance was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Performances, Very Stupid Plot","review":"I will say the performances in this movie, particularly by Mortensen, Ed Harris and William Hurt are excellent. But c'mon, this movie is absurd. First, how can a \\"hitman\\" who has been out of commission for nearly 20 years somehow remember all these moves and execute them perfectly without a training regimine that would create at least some suspicion among his family?! Give me a break. This movie is ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"This movie was so dull and dry!!! It was boring from start to finish. With the exception of the sex scenes between Viggo Mortensen and Maria Bello!!, and the fight scenes with the son and that stupid jock!!! Either than that it was corny as hell!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Film","review":"I didn't expect to like this movie, the title in itself might make some people shy away from it, especially those who dislike violence in general. It seemed like a average \\"guy movie\\", the type my husband loves to bring home from the video store. I must say that the director delivered the goods, as did the actors in this entertaining film. The relationships and family dynamics were portrayed in a realistic manner. I came to care about the family quickly and couldn't walk away. I am ashamed to say that I was too quick to judge this film just by it's title. It is not just a movie with violence in it, there is a purpose here, and I am sure if you give it a try, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad I Paused It To Warn You","review":"I'm 18 minutes into the movie and it's so bad I put it on pause to come and warn you not to waste your time or money.I'm embarrassed for the actors. No chemistry, pathetic dialogue, all around dull acting. No one is convincing or interesting.I don't think any story line, whatsoever, could redeem this, but I'll give it 5 more minutes (I want to somehow feel the money wasn't a complete waste) then I will probably end up reading a book.This is one for which you simply can not trust the 4 and 5 star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Minority Report","review":"I sat down with a friend to watch this dvd and after about thirty minutes, we gave it up as a bad bet, so I can't claim to have seen the whole thing, but after a beginning like that, I doubt it was going to change my mind about the movie.Yes, Maria Bella was gorgeous and charming. Yes, the violence was generally well shown. This is what happens when someone takes a round through the top of the head and much of their face is blown off or when someone has the septum driven into their brain.On the other hand, the pacing seemed glacial, the formula as predictable as a date with a prostitute, and most of the characters disposable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Several strong performances","review":"As someone who has followed David Cronenberg's career since Scanners, to me this new film is the latest step in his evolution to a mature and skilled filmmaker. It's amazing to chart his progress from that early work to this subtle and complex movie. The story surprised me (the expected climax came about an hour in, and everything after that was new territory) and it got me thinking about how an act of violence can change a family. In that respect it has some parallels to Road to Perdition, although that is a superior movie. Still, I was impressed by many of the acting performances in History, especially from Maria Bello, the great Ed Harris, and the young guy who played the teenage son. It stops short of being a \\"masterpiece\\" -- the plot was a bit too chopped-up for that, and it fell into a lull at odd times -- but it was still an entertaining and worthwhile movie-going experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"golden violence","review":"This film is about a husband/father who has a history of violence. Yup, it really is that simple, haha.He denies it of course, through most of the movie. That's where the storyline comes in-When an incident at a diner turns the guy into a local hero, this is where the storytelling picks up.You'd think there would be lots of celebrating and thanking going on, but just the opposite occurs- two suspicious men walk into the diner the next morning and accuse the guy of living under a false name, and that his real name is actually Joey, and he's from Philadelphia.Anyway, the acting is really really good, the storyline is fantastic, and the older son has a minor story involving a school bully that has a nice ending. Great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch for 2 minutes every 30 minutes...","review":"Awful! Need to watch of super-fast forward. Not very clever or thought-provoking, just horrible. The special features were better than the movie itself, and that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious title, movie garbage","review":"Pretentious title, movie garbage. I kept thinking, \\"This has to be tongue in cheek. He can't be serious.\\" But apparently he was.What is William Hurt doing in a thing like this? Fortunately, he isn't in it for long.An experienced moviegoer would guess from the casting of the hero everything that was to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gee,,,I thought i saw this on TV........","review":"Just what the public needs more violence. I guess the war in Iraq, children being kidnapped, raped and murdered, and for another example the daily killings in Hartford Connecticut isn't enough for people to enjoy. Hollywood wants to reinforce even more violence with a film called \\"The History of Violence.\\" I wonder if this is why americans have become what they see and hear on the news? It's getting very scary the types of films that Hollywood is producing. As you know violence becomes violence. We are getting no better than all the other haters in the world. We look back in history to Hitler, Mussalini, Sadam and now regular americans. Think about it people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funniest Movie Ever!!","review":"I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. My husband and I were cracking up. This movie is a comedy right? It has to be. No way they were being serious. I wonder if the actors knew they were making such a horrible film when they were filming it. I think this film will be considered one of the greatest comedies of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far...","review":"The worst movie ever made. I actually sat through the whole thing hoping it would get better. The acting was beyond awful, the story was a joke. I honestly was blown away at how terrible it was, do NOT waste your money or time on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage for all seasons!!","review":"This was a mess. This movie gave me the feeling that I was was watching a really bad made for tv film. I was mesmerized at how deplorable the acting was. Everyone just seemed like they were sleep-walking through their roles. Viggo Mortensen is generally a decent actor but in this he acted like he was just acting in this so he could pay off a car loan. All in all, this film was predictable, formulaic and a bore. Please save your money for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped frequently","review":"Loved the movie. It continuously stopped to download which was annoying:(The audio wasn't the best either. Thought the movie was terrific."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great build-up, horrible ending","review":"This movie built up to nothing. The ending was a huge disappointment. Do not see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"My general recommendation is to lower your expectations of a movie and you'll get more out of it, but that does not apply to this film. I will summarize with this: had the ending not been as weak as it was, the overall film would have been \\"okay.\\" The weak ending washed away any and all redeeming characteristics this movie had.Have a few beers and watch a different movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good followup for Viggo or Cronenberg","review":"Viggo Mortensen is a good actor.Cronenberg is a good director.Both have made hits, both have made misses. This movie I have to file under the latter. What starts out as an intersting story (a silent type gets forced to show what's brooding under his skin), takes a turn for the worst when his actions wake the interest of - how original - the mob. There's a cat and mouse game that simply ends with three dead mobsters, a father/son conflict, a signature sex scene, and... well, Cronenberg is well known for his in-your-face bloodshed, so it isn't unexpected, but the last third of the movie turns it into a turd of a movie, that ends with not even a sizzle. The whole roadtrip ending in carnage and the anticlimactic finale left me with a bad taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"More layers than an onion","review":"This movie did it for me on so many levels. Its brilliant on its commentary about violence in America, in the family, on the genetic level, and in many other arenas. I can't say enough about it, and honestly, the trailers for it really didnt make it look as smart as it truly is. This is one to buy.My favorite scene in the movie is when the high school bully cuts off the two serial killer's truck. Suddenly, the predator turns to prey in just an instant, without words spoken. All it takes is a glance to let the teens know where they lie on the food chain. It is THAT type of acting, and expert direction from Cronenberg (who I gotta admit I dont always care for) that makes this one of the better movies I've seen in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Cronenbeg Mob Tale","review":"A diner owner's Philly ganster past catches up with him following publicity over his heroic action during a robbery. Now Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) must make things right with his wife (Maria Bello) and son while looking over his shoulder to protect his family from mob wackers. Ed Harris and William Hurt are at their best projecting mobster sadism. Mortensen and Bello work perfectly together, especially in the steamy \\"gangster sex\\" scene on the stairs. A History of Violence has good fast-paced gun action and never becomes bogged down in unnecessary detail.This film is very good even though it lacks big production grit and things unfold too conveniently, as good continually tromps over evil; but this is not a problem since you'll always be rooting for Viggo as he fights off more than a fair share of mob low-life creatures. The BD had very good picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:Exceptionally well-crafted scenes of bloodshed (Cronenberg is one of the best directors when it comes to making movie violence seem actually violent) and a stellar supporting turn from William Hurt lift this thriller above the ordinary; it's not a great film, but it is one which will most likely linger in your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mainstream Cronenberg","review":"David Cronenberg (The Fly (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),Videodrome - Criterion Collection) is an artful and masterful director. There's no denying it. The man behind such films asDead Ringers - Criterion Collection,Naked Lunch - Criterion CollectionandShiverscomes with this film, a stark difference from his fist films of the century.A History of Violence is about a man who, after becoming a local hero, is hounded by a couple of mobsters who believe he is someone else.The strength in this movie isn't the script alone, it's the directing of one David Cronenberg. A movie that you should see, maybe it'll spark your interest in the often overlooked David Cronenberg.The DVD includes a commentary from the director, a few featurettes going over every aspect of the filmmaking, a \\"Too Commercial for Cannes\\" feature, a deleted scene, and the behind the scenes of that deleted scenes.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"History of violence where's part 2","review":"Loved the video. They were one hot couple. A part two would be very nice but you would need to make sure the 2 main characters were the same. A lot of action. Two thumbs up"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont listen to the reviews - this movie is B A D","review":"Every review I read said this movie was great, well folks....it aint! I am not sure if it was meant to be a comedy but half the cinema was laughing. Unbelievable storyline, horrendeous acting - although Maria Bello did her best opposite a horrendeous performance by Viggo Mortensen. There were no twists, no subble undertones, this movie was dull, boring and downright just bad.If you are still going to see the movie and dont figure it out in the first half hour you should contact Rolling Stone magazine - they apparently like their reviewers sans intelligence.This movie has no edge, it lacks emotion, drama and believability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring so very very boring","review":"It is a sad state of affairs when the most passionate actor in a movie is William Hurt. Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris race each other to complete ambivalence in this story of a man hiding out from his past.Maria Bello plays the victim wife perfectly dull. Mortensen and Bello's love scenes are perfectly orchestrated and have that heavy pendantic feeling of a machine executing its task for the millionth time.Dialogue and scenes have the stilted affect of a high school drama production. Cronenberg may have meant this picture as an stinging indictment of US violence but it only leaves the dull throbbing ache of an overworked message brought to the audience by robots who do nothing and then explode.Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad premise, but thought provoking","review":"Willing suspension of disbelief is pushed to the limits in this movie. One has to believe that the cops can't put all these deaths together. One has to believe that twenty years of clean living make up for being a sociopathic murderer. When the movie ended it took a minute for me to realize how much the movie was manipulating me, wanting me to sympathize or even just empathize with this character, just because he wanted to be good. Well, just unlock all the prison doors, 'cause those guys are going straight! Honest! And one last gripe - I don't understand the necessity of the graphic oral sex scene. Luckily I was watching with my husband, because if it had been anyone else, I would have been uncomfortable, and I'm no prude. I give it two stars instead of one because it has made me think about our justice system, and punishment in our society. Any movie that makes me consider issues has at least some value."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most underrated movies.","review":"This movie is very good if you're into action. It starts off kind of slow, but is really packed full of action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch action","review":"Viggo Mortensen has a very strong screen persona and is always enjoyable to watch. The story is very much a western in a modern setting with the good guy, bad guys, and lots of gunplay. If you like action movies, this has it in abundance. The acting by everyone is stellar."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Expected More But It's Still Good","review":"Too many times I've watched a movie expecting greatness and not getting that. I just knew A History Of Violence would be good but it only met some of my expectations. Although it will keep you entertained you might get mad at it lacking some realness. It may look real but trust me it doesn't look real enough and it goes on for the entire movie. For example when Tom saves his diner and the people in it he hits one of the robbers in the face with a pot of coffee and it's so obvious it's digitalized. Besides that and some other unneeded scenes this film is very good and it ends very well with a nice shootout. Viggo does very well with the fight scenes and gives you a lot of action without gun play. He plays this role really good because he makes you believe he's Tom that other guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watched with 9 people, not one enjoyed it","review":"The problem with this movie is that it tries to be profound, but is not in touch with the world. Furthermore, it doesn't have the appeal of an action movie with tons of violence and such. It wasn't entertaining, and certainly didn't offer anything else to the audience.Firstly, the son's sidestory is just contrived and lame. High schoolers do not act like that. Whoever wrote the parts for the \\"bully jock\\" and the son needs to go and watch high schoolers in actual life. I could go on and on, as the movie is all-around poorly cemented in reality.I hoped this movie was going to be action packed, but it wasn't. There were 3 decent action scenes (lasting probably about 2 minutes altogether), and the rest of the movie was unecessary, untasteful sex scenes and poorly written character development and attempts to build some sort of a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment to cinema","review":"I'm sure this review will be rated as unhelpful simply because people disagree with my opinion, but I have to tell you this movie was absolutely awful.The synopsis sounds as if it would be really interesting, and I'm sure the graphic novel WAS really well done, but the movie fell waaaay short. Adding ridiculously gross violence and absurd and unnecessary pornographic sex scenes doesn't make a film \\"edgy\\" or \\"gritty\\" or \\"realistic,\\" it just makes it seem almost juvenille in it's attempt to pretend to be art.When I went to see this, SEVERAL audience members got up and walked out of theatre. The saddest part is that this movie COULD have been really good. There really were some themes that might have made for a thought-provoking movie. And of course this is a great director. But this movie is a perfect example of taking a concept with great potential and doing a really really bad job."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Worst Movie Ever","review":"The first worst movie ever is clearly 'Bottom Feeders' (1998). Underdeveloped characters, contrived dialogues, absurd sex scenes, and a complete lack of creativity yield a predictably lame movie. If you want to see a decent movie with the exact same plot, check out 'High Crimes' (2002) with Ashley Judd and Morgan Freeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Garbage","review":"I still can't comprehend why the critics and so many others love this movie so much, I've sat through it twice, and have absolutely hated it both times.The writing is terrible, and not just the dialogue, which is so stupid and pointless it really seems like the writers fell asleep while typing it out, but the story itself is just ridiculous and not \\"powerful\\" or \\"meaningful\\" like everyone keeps saying.I love Viggo Mortensen and Ed Harris, but in my opinion they were both tragically wasted in this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A History of Cliches","review":"I don't think the director missed a single cliche in making this film.

Boy, I could not have been more wrong. The movie did not flow together well, it was difficult to follow, and there were so many holes in the plotline you needed to have Michael Jordan airtime to negotiate them. The ending had no resolution, and the sex scene was totally gratuitous. And I also agree with the reviewer who said the wife and her reaction was not realistic.

It was slow and to me seemed as if some editor got cut happy leaving you with a bunch of small scenes that seem to orbit around their own sun in separate solar systems. I was also disappointed that they felt it necessary to drag out the sex scenes the way they did. I am not a prude by any means but they just seemed disconnected and over the top.I am very sorry that this movie was not put together better - it took the admirable acting talents of the cast, wadded them up and threw them in the trash, along with the $19.99 I spent for the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated \\"Violence\\" Misses the Mark","review":"Imagine if Fritz Lang or Alfred Hitchcock had a crack at \\"A History of Violence.\\" The legendary filmmakers certainly would have jettisoned screenwriter Josh Olsen's sloppy adaptation of the popular graphic novel.

There are effective performances by Viggo Mortensen, Ed Harris and William Hurt, but it's all for naught.

But I feel a sense of duty on this one.This movie sucks. Hard. The acting was worse than that of, oh I don't know, Carnosaur. William Hurt especially, Oscar nomination aside. Either the Academy is flat-out retarded or they have a very subtle sense of humor.The plot is also pretty pathetic. It goes from zero to sixty in a heartbeat leaving a lot of things unexplained. If you are an average film watcher like I consider myself to be, I think you will find this all quite irritating.One more thing that bothered me was the way this film depicted people from small towns. The characters had a very slow way of speaking, and their mannerisms were overtly backwards (this might have just been due, again, to the unbelivably bad acting).I think this is one instance where the critics must have had their heads somewhere while viewing it. Hands down, the worst of 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Hour","review":"I am a Cronenberg fan, however, clearly...he is past his prime seemingly trading upon his former self. I looked forward to this movie due its storyline directed by Cronenberg. Succinctly, this movie waddles through implausibilities from beginning to end. The end, a final implausibility eclipsing all that led up to it. Actors' performances, exemplary. Pacing, exemplary. However, as a technical piece, fair. This, due how inexplicably sophomoric this movie registers as a whole. It fails to deliver, plain and simple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended For Non-Squeamish Thinking Adults","review":"This is an excellent film - it's exciting, thought provoking, unpredictable and has some great performances.

The story is contrived. Some of the dialogue is laughable. The violence is so graphic that it's disturbing, for no apparent reason than shock value.

While losing based on the novel the movie loses all of what made the graphioc novel so different and fascinating. While I love a good sex scene on the stairwell it really made absolutely no sense in the context of the story.

A total waste of time, IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I expected...","review":"I was under the impression from a viewer of the movie that the acting was bad but I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the acting BUT the best thing for me that I got from this flick was the fact that the directing style I was really impressed with. Acting was good but it was the direction that really grabbed my eye and the scenes were just enough and not overly graphic and definitely got the point across. Kudos to this movie and the Title of it is a lot more than it actually shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Violent, Moving, Powerful","review":"As the title might suggest, the central concern of this movie is violence, individual and that of criminal organizations. The two questions the movie raises -- can we ever escape violence? And, can a person whose life has been stained by violence ever escape its effects? -- are not answered, or at least in any simple way. But, we are forced to ask ourselves what does violence, bloodshed resolve? Some things perhaps, but the traditional Hollywood pattern of shoot the bad guys and everything is then okay the movie is too intelligent and sensitive to accept. We also see in a beautiful job of acting by the entire cast (William Hurt as a crime boss is stunning, for one) how individuals get caught in nets they think they can free themselves of, but which always have layers upon layers. This is another one of those must-see movies, for writing, acting, directing, and production values."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film and excellent dvd","review":"This film is blunt, concise, and extremely well directed and acted. I was compelled to write this review because of the great job done with the extras on the dvd. I have never come to know so intimately how a director works from watching the special features of a dvd. I value the insights learned from these features tremendously. There is a lenghty making of feature that really demonstrates the fine craftsmanship and intelligence that went into this effort. If you just saw this in the theater and came out somewhat satisfied, you owe it to yourself to at least rent this dvd, if only to check out the documentaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell happened ???","review":"I just watch this movie and i still dont get it.

But it left me wondering why I bothered with it for an hour and half. No pay off of any kind. The highly illogical \\"story\\" barely makes coherent sense. This is the kind of movie that film snobs think they're supposed to like and will spout off all kinds of pretentious crap about how deep it is. Bull. This stinker wishes it was actually about something, but it doesn't wind up being anything remarkable. And I can't believe William Hurt was Oscar nominated for such a brief, hammy, over-the-top role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough of a Payback","review":"The plot had a lot of potential, but it ended up being a short, predictable flick with lots of meaningless violence. They tried unconvincingly to make you believe that Viggo wasnt actually the guy the mob was after. All of the good, tense, dramatic moments were in the trailer (like a bad comedy where all the good jokes are in the trailer). If you're in the mood for violence, watch Gibson's Payback instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended by a friend.","review":"Too predictable. I figured our the plot in five minutes.

He is well liked by the people and well loved by his family. His stock goes up even more when he thwarts a violent hold up in his diner by killing the two criminals.But the news coverage gets the attention of even more violent thugs from Philadelphia, thugs who claim that Tom Stall was known other than the former gangster Joey Cusack. Tom vehemently denies the charges, but over the course of the film, you learn that there is nonetheless a history of violence.The acting is great, the plot is disturbing, and the conclusion will have you thinking for a long time. I thought it was a well made movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Story, Billings","review":"This was a very intriguing movie, for the most part. I liked the fact that the action, although violent at times, was not overdone. Most of the movie is pretty low-key.What I didn't care for was our hero's wife, who was way too big-city-hard looking and profane to be some small-town country girl who would marry such a nice guy as \\"Tom.\\"William Hurt gets third billing in the film but only shows up with 14 minutes left! Granted, his role is a memorable one, however. Ed Harris also had few lines for someone who gets good billing. Another guy I thought was pretty cool was the sheriff, played by Peter MacNeill. He had bigger roles than Harris or Hurt but got no billing. Go figure.Overall, this was a unique film and one I would would watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"An excellent movie--acting, writing, directing, editing--with nice twists and believable characters.

At any rate, a very well done book...worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice photography of beautiful pregnant women","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think the photography in this book is very well done and some of the photos are very interesting, but I think it can be a rather depressing book for the basic female population.I am an OB/GYN and I constantly see women who are concerned about their weight or their body image when pregnant and I dont see this book as being very helpful. I see famous models and wives that are pregnant but not reflective of the general pregnant population. I think they should have shown the woman that weighs 180-200 lbs or the woman with stretch marks and how beautiful they can be as well.I would not consider placing this in my waiting room for fear of a riot from my patients. I think all pregnant women are beautiful and they dont need to spend (money)on a book that shows them......they need to be told by their spouses.Spend the money on \\"What to expect when you're expecting.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking!","review":"I bought this book for a pregnant friend of mine after seeing Danica on Oprah. The pictures will take your breath away. It's a beautiful celebration of the joys of being pregnant.

I finally came across Slushy at a local toy store. My daughter loves him. He's super soft. Some products claim to be soft but aren't really. This one really is. Very huggable. My daughter's twin 11 mo. old sisters adore him too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pope Paul VI- the Confessor","review":"For the way His Holiness was vilified when this document came out in 1968, Pope Paul VI should be known as Paul the Confessor. He truly suffered for the Church over this encyclical letter. And that is quite a shame, for his teaching in Humanae Vitae has turned out to be prophetic. A must read for anyone interested in life issues today. With the state of much of the world in our time( about 70% of all conceptions in Russia end in abortion) Paul's wisdom is sure help and a much needed path to a more caring and holy world. The sanctity of life is paramount."},{"rating":"2","title":"The design","review":"When something is designed to work a certain way, then that's the way it works.

They are complete junk. They don't fit well and do not shape around the knee or elbow at all. My son has a set of Hot Wheel pads that are a million times better than these. When my daughter wears these I have to strap them so tight to get them to stay in place that it hurts her and leaves red marks, but when I put them on her comfortably they slide all over and stay stiff and straight. They are a giant watse of money. If your daughter is a huge Princess fan and has to have these you might as well cut out a cardboard Disney Princess logo and strap it to your kids legs it would be cheaper and might work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from these!!!","review":"I bought these for my daughter, and I can agree with other reviewers. They don't fit well, and don't allow for her knees or elbows to bend. It's pretty hard to skate or ride a bike, or skateboard, when you can't bend your knees!

They are laminated, and make it difficult to grasp slippery foods like the udon in soup.I also find these a bit too light for my taste. I prefer a heavier chopstick, because they feel more comfortable in my hand. Some people prefer the lightweight types, but I don't.They do work fine for foods that aren't very slippery. I have no problem using them to eat fried rice, sesame chicken, or even mongolian beef. They're also durable, and they have stood up to many washings in the dishwasher with no cracks or warping.Since I eat a lot of udon noodle soup, these chopsticks aren't as useful as I had hoped. If I only used them for this, I would rate these two stars. But because they work okay for other foods and are durable, I will give them four stars. Their durability is really their saving grace for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid","review":"They are laminated, have very strong chemical smell even after \\"cooking\\" them with hot water.

Considering these are from China, who knows what is in that lacquer.I did not get what I paid for which is the Totally Bamboo brand.

The novella to which both movies owe their inspiration, Waltz into Darkness (by the same guy who wrote Rear Window), is better than either movie, and has the best ending (truly noir) of all.

The heads have Dylan to thank for tha flava and courage to turn the magnifying glass inward. \\"Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands\\" drum-kick-bass bottom can be heard in %50 of hip hop tracks since 1996. \\"Visions of Johanna\\" will reverberate up in ya head for weeks to come. After listening to this album three or four times you will see what the RZA was trying to do with 36 Chambers 30 years later. Tha song remains the same. This is a must for all true heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highway 61 Mach 2","review":"It's hard to say which exactly is better, Highway 61 or this one and so I'm going to say they are both great but personally, I'd say from the point of view of variety of song style and slightly stronger material, I'd plumb for this one. With Dylan it was always about the words anyway and much less so the music and so whether the tracks here were done totally acoustically or with electric guitars really makes little difference. The brilliant words would have made the album great anyway. This version is very well remastered and comes in a unique and very cool mini-lp replica sleeve. This is probably the best sounding version of \\"Blonde...\\" that's out there too.

Tracks such as I want you, Absolutely Sweet Marie and many others make this a very pleasent record. Dylan is such a great lyricist that listening to his lyrics is pure ear candy. I must say that I love the book-let. The photos are great except the cover photo which looks a bit blurred. However, maybe they did this on purpose. Still and all this is a great record that should not be missed. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As great today as ever","review":"Blonde on Blonde offers a timeless window into the soul of American music. Dylan deserves great credit for his incredible singing and song writing, and, no doubt, for also inspiring his musicians. The producer deserves everyone's thanks for having kept things together -- the song/performance choices are right-on (something demonstrated clearly by \\"No Direction Home's disc 2). The accompanying musicians deserve applauds from then & now to the end of time for their professionalism, their soulfulness, and their playfulness. What amazes me beyond all else is that the music on this album always sounds current, of the moment. And its music ends up being more than the sum of its parts. How this is accomplishment, I cannot say. All I can say is that this is an album that gives a great deal of pleasure. Thanks, Bob and all, again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a reissue","review":"At least on the picture on ebay it showed the giant yellow sticker that states its a reissue.(and it was cheaper).

This is one of his few CDs without any weak spots; in fact, learning to take teasing like the humor in \\"Rainy Day Women Nos. 12& 35\\", contrary to what THE NEW ROLLING STONE ALBUM GUIDE said, will make you a stronger person in the end. Other great songs here include \\"Stuck Inside Of Mobile With Those Memphis Blues Again\\" (easily the best song on the CD), \\"One Of Us Must Know (Sooner Or Later)\\", and \\"Just Like A Woman.\\" Dylan's belief that Indonesia's 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist was trumped-up and unjust makes this CD an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Botched Remaster","review":"Did anyone at CBS/Sony listen to the finished product before they started shipping it?

Maybe it was his disregard for smooth, high-fidelity recordings that I always preferred in all genres that put me off. But the older I get the more I find I love his music more and more. While not quite as hypnotic and intoxicating as \\"Highway 61 Revisited,\\" this album still pulls me into a world that intrigues and fascinates. His phrasing and his carnival-like lyrics leave me shaking my head in awe and I feel like I missed out on so much by not paying better attention to him in the decades before. Alas, I figure better late than never and I was happy to add this to my collection. Please do the same. You'll thank me someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves 10 stars","review":"Blonde On Blonde on SACD is the best mix of, arguably, the best album Dylan has ever made.

I just wish Sony would hurry up and put out more Dylan titles. There are more than forty to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Blonde?","review":"I bought this album and the one before it-Highway 61 Revisited-on vinyl when they came out. Blonde is very good-I really like most of it. But Highway 61 is superlative. It cannot be beat. I wore out my first vinyl copy of the album, and that takes quite a few spins to accomplish. It became unplayable, so I bought another one-in stereo this time instead of the cheaper mono. My original Blonde on Blonde still sounds good 37 years later. If you're not familiar with Dylan, I'd recommend Highway 61 first. You won't regret it. Consider Bringing It All Back Home-another gem. All three are excellent...."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only ever bought one Dylan album","review":"This album came out at the peak of Dylan's creativity. When he broke away from traditional folk music and broke into rock and roll, 2 albums stand out. Highway 61 Revisited and Blond on Blonde. Both are excellent and contain some of Bob's catchiest and thoughtful tunes. If you only ever buy one album of his, I would recommend Blonde on Blonde. I give it a slight edge over Highway 61 Revisited only because it is a double album. Most people consider Highway 61 Revisited Bob's crowning masterpiece and it is excellent - but Blonde on Blonde is just as good and contains twice the music. Get both if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music, But What's He Talking About??","review":"Musically, this album is superb. On par with Highway 61 Revisited. If you dug that album you will really dig this one. All his best stuff is on here, including \\"I Want You\\", \\"Rainy Day Women\\" and \\"Just Like A Woman\\". His best tongue-in-cheek blues number is here with \\"Leopard Skin Pillbox Hat\\" which is good for a giggle. \\"Stuck Inside Of Mobile With The Memphis Blues Again\\" goes on about three minutes longer than it should. That's the only thing that keeps it from being a great song. \\"Sad-Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands\\" is also too long and a bit of a drag. Yeah, I know, I KNOW. Blasphemy. Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got to like Dylan","review":"Most people I know like Dylan, a few hate him, some others only like Blowing In The Wind and Mr. Tambourine Man. This album should be in the library of anyone who does like him. If you have no Dylan, don't make this your first one, go with something like Freewheelin' instead. Obviously, if you are not a Dylan fan to begin with it, you will not like this.

It was imeadiately a huge sucess to all Bobby fans. Not a bad song on it. The lyrics have all become household regularities since that grand tune, \\"Rainy Day Women #12 and 35\\" was given birth to. This often comically amusing album is great on the new SACD. It has been worth the wait. We're back onto two discs. (Like the original album). The lyrics are written with care and the music is worth hearing on surround I would say. The band playing with Bob certainly knows how to jam out those \\"with it\\", loonie tunes. He's great on the harmonica (of course) once more and will dazzle us again with the release of his next album, the follow-up to \\"Love and Theft\\". Beta speaking, OVER AND OUT..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is better than the cd","review":"I own a lot of music. I respect a lot of music new and old. I bought this and his essential collection. I strapped on my headphones and listened.rainy day women on this cd was the only song I could tolerate. Yes I know he WAS a great songwriter, but man he really can NOT SING.Seems this album has more affect for its nostalgic purposes than for the music it contains. I am only 33 so I was not involved in the \\"hippie 60s\\".Now I love Jefferson airplane, Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Doors and old Heart.

From the infamous \\"Rainy day women 12 and 35\\" (which isn't actually about getting high) to the chilling \\"Sad-eyed lady of the lowlands\\" dylan packs a huge poetic punch that will make you think about things ina much less political manner than some thing like The Times They Are. Another great recording linked to this is The Live 1966 Royal Albert Hall Recording, which includes acoustic versions of many blonde songs. Check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literary Omnipotence","review":"If I had one album to take with me to another planet it would be either this or the \\"Beatles\\" (white album). This is literature as interpreted by Rock and Roll. The only song at all close to average is the one which was most popular on the radio, \\"I Want You.\\" There is enough satire and hummor, pathos and drama, poetry and wit here to last a life time. If your old vinyl is tired from being under the nail too many times or you never had this album, buy it. Chew on \\"Pledging My Time\\", \\"Absolutly Sweet Marie\\", and \\"Stuck Inside of Mobile\\". Give a wry grin to \\"Rainy Day Woman\\", \\"Leopard Skin Pill Box Hat\\" and \\"Fourth Time Around\\".

I'm sure many will record his songs after he's gone, but you had the decency to record this while he's around to enjoy it. This is Jack with a jazz trio at his best, singing like a real jazz pro! The Mike Renzi Trio is well featured here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhat reminiscent of early excellent Jack Jones","review":"This CD marks a partial return to form for Jack Jones. For a change, he's doing only songs that are worthy of his talent and for that reason, he doesn't need to gussy up the songs with vocal tricks to make them more palatable. He sings them straight, and the results are generally very fine, especially on \\"You Must Believe in Spring\\" and \\"It Amazes Me.\\" \\"One For My Baby\\" is more like Sinatra's version than Bennett's, though it has a hint of that honky tonk piano Bennett likes to use when he's singing it.Jones' voice isn't what it once was, but he's still in there swinging. His best since his Michel Legrand album of the early 70's."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"Unlike other listeners, I did not enjoy this CD. In fact, it made me very uncomfortable and I couldn't help but wish for Mr. Bennett to be singing his own standards.I've seen Jack Jones in person and have fallen for his cool charm, but he just doesn't deliver the goods in this attempt.Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jack Jones' best CD's","review":"I have been picking up Jack Jones albums for about thirty years. I have a lot of his old LP's as well as a good number of his CD's. I rate this particular outing as one of his finest efforts. Everything about it is first-rate: the caliber of Mr. Jones' singing, the quality of the songs he selected, the tasteful arrangements, and the excellence of the sound. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does anyone remember????","review":"Hi, Jack Jones fans-I'm glad there are others who appreciate his artistry over the years. This isn't a review but a request for information: my sister had a Jones album long ago that featured some of his best songs like Willow and Blue Boy. The album cover was grainy, like canvas. Does anyone know the name of the album, and how I can get it? How about another compilation featuring those songs?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing candor, fine sound","review":"I discovered Jack Jones a few years ago in a splendid tv special done with Mel Torme, Maureen McGovern, and Buddy Rich on the late Tommy Dorsey. This was an exciting program, with Jones and colleagues exuding the enthusiasm one associates with Sinatra's stint with Dorsey.This latest album is Jack Jones in another tribute, in name to Tony Bennett, in fact to what Jones has learned over the years. There's more than a bit of soothing Bennett, Sinatra-with-feeling and, to me at least, the inflections of a Joe Williams.The accompanying trio pays a debt to Ralph Sharon, though with some invention of its own. The sound is very, very fine [albiet with Jones slipping to the background once or twice, maybe to mask a slight weariness in his voice], producing the kind of intimacy which encourages the listener to actually listen.All in all a happy and satisfying album from one of the true ballad singers left in the business. More please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a fairly decent jazz cd","review":"This is the first jazz cd that I have ever heard Jack do. I think he did a good job as far as his singing goes. I liked the song selection and Jacks' interpretation of the lyrics.The problem I had with this cd was that some of the arrangements I thought didn't work. I felt like this area could have been better. His pianist Mike Renzi, I thought, had a good touch on the piano keys.I think most people will want to own this cd. Please enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One small step for the great Jack Jones","review":"This album is a step in the right direction for Jack, comprised of standards as it is, but he still clings to the new style he adopted when he left Kapp for RCA in 1968, and abandoned the sound which had made him a star. When someone starts out on top, but still wishes to reach new heights, he often ends up going the wrong way. Come back to the top where you began and belong, Jack. P.S. I'll take Pete King's strings over this three-piece jazz combo any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underrated?","review":"I would agree that Jack Jones certainly was underrated in his early days, and I still hope for a CD transfer of his first album ~ THIS LOVE OF MINE ~ for Capitol.However, it all went wrong when he moved from Kapp to RCA, and he went on to record the most unsuitable stuff. He really touched bottom with his I AM A SINGER album, and his Gershwin songbook album for Columbia simply showd that that once great voice was considerably frayed round the edges. He was no longer able to sustain notes.This self-indulgent album simply demonstrates that the wheel has turned full-circle and that he is now somewhat overrated. It really saddens me to think of all those years when he was still in good voice that have gone to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like funeral dirges, you'll love this.","review":"This is a disappointing CD if you are familiar with Jack Jones earlier Kapp albums from the 60's and 70's when he could really sing and had some style. The readings in this recording sound like funeral dirges and are generally quite depressing. There is plenty of good Jack Jones out there but not this one. If you like Tony Bennett, then stick with Tony Bennett and not a watered down treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riches to Rags...","review":"I am only guessing that Jack was in need of money when this album was cut!

This resulted in several lockups with the ipod. No fun riding down the road. I then, in several steps, proceeded to drill ventilation holes to allow the ipod to cool off while riding. Better but still crashing my ipod. What I have now looks like swiss cheese and still does not cool enough to work properly.

Enemies in this game are at same level as your highest level character. Above that, your facing two to one, or three to one odds. This game is so hard that I had given up. I had never reset so many times in a game since FFT. Hoshigami could have been one of the greatest title if it wasn't so difficult.

Why the development team thought that would be a cool interface is beyond me, all I can think is that why didn't bother playing it before release.

The good part about this book is at the end where he says he dosent want to fight the bull and he wants to become a doctor. as a matter of fact the only reason why my teacher wanted me to read this piece of crap was because of the ending come on.If you see this book burn it i can't belive that so many people like this crap!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Story","review":"This book, I found went fast.

Who wants to read a book with a glossary in the back??? Manolo is the son of the greatest matodor in spain who was gored during a bullfight. Now everyone in Spain wants Manolo to be a bull fighter (come on peeps the kid is like 10 and there teaching him to fight bulls? Thats kinda violent isn't it?) Manolo dosn't have an ounce of courage (I guess you would say that he's a \\"pretty boy\\") he dosn't want to fight the bull. On the day of his bull fight he gives the bull to some one who really deserves to fight.

Manolo's father was a famous bullfighter. Then he died while he was bullfighting. Everyone in Archangel now calls Manolo's father their hero because he was such a good bullfighter. Now the people of Archangel are depending on Manolo to be a great bullfighter, just like his father was. So the people are going to make manolo fight at 12 years old. Manolo is really dreading this day, but he knows it will come sometime. When the day comes that he finally has to fight his bull, he decides that he really does not want to be a bull fighter like his father. So Manolo decides that he is not going to fight his bull and that he wants to become a doctor.I really liked this book because it was very exciting.

The acting, as in most action movies, is a bit superficial, but the overall movie is solid. Jim Brown, given his impressive size, is perfect as a tough action hero. The majority of the movie is set in Mexico, thus giving it an exotic feel. The racial epithets by the villains also give the movie an appropriate sense of the palpable racism of the 70's. Rip Torn gives an over-the-top performance as the main bad-guy Hoffo. As noted in the other reviews, Stella Stevens is perfect eye-candy in her supporting role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"If this were 1963, I'd advise you to buy this book. However, it's 2007, and while John Toland did an admirable job researching his material and visiting the various sites made notorious by the public enemies whose exploits he depicted, the fact is that much of the book's contents is old news and simply inaccurate.

I've been trying to find a book on the Karpis-Barker gang and so far this is the best I've seen. Although I am confused now because all the books I've read said Ma Barker was a sweet old lady that new nothing of their criminal lives.

Wm Lee Stokes has written a book on the geology of the Plateau Lands of the American West. It's center is Four Corners and it stretches beyond the Colorado Plateau to the Great American Desert to the Southwest to the Rocky Mountains (page 3).Stokes describes hard rock and soft rock. He describes large rock and small rock, fractured rock and what makes it (most are found broken and lying on the ground due subsurface pressures that cause joints), the colors of rock, cliffs, mesas and buttes, canyons, arroyos, washes, and gullies, monuments, etc.On one hand Stokes has not written a book with much depth to it. A \\"Geology for Dummies\\" book would have far more depth. On the other hand, Stokes has written a book with some great hand-drawn sketches that give me fond memories of southwestern Utah (the Zion National Park and Bryce Canyon area) where I bought the book.

I tried several times. First, I don't care for the way the author phrases things - I found him excessively descriptive. For me, it felt like he was trying to fill space by overdoing it. Then, he jumped around quite disjointedly - a technique I usually enjoy, actually, but again, it just didn't work for me the way Chaon did it. I very much liked the premise of the novel, so I am going to try yet again, and if I can get past his style enough to get into the story, I will edit this review accordingly. Maybe it will grow on me. I doubt this review is particularly helpful, but as a Vine participant, I needed to write it as part of my agreement with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait, what was the story with this character again?","review":"Normally I enjoy stories that switch between characters or jump around in time, but this was done poorly in my opinion. The first part of the book jumped around so much between years and characters that by the time the author started writing in chronological order I had no attachment to the characters and didn't really care what happened to them because I was just starting to get over my confusion with the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad and Lovely","review":"The characters and emotions in this book are so finely tuned, the storytelling so gripping, the pacing so perfect.

I found Chaon's storytelling to be too wordy for me. In addition, he admits to being a short story writer. Therefore, you're sent forward and backward in time, among different characters and their perspectives. I'm not sure he he's trying to do it like Audrey Niffenegger's *The Time Traveler's Wife* but was unsuccessful in doing so.The first three chapters were interesting and I had thought that I would enjoy this book. However, beyond the third chapter (and certain excerpts in other chapters), the story goes downhill. For me, it was troublesome remembering who was who in what year and whatnot.In addition, I found Chaon to be too wordy in storytelling. I had to put the book down for little mental and visual breaks. Plus, I found the characters to be too depressing. It was as if life is just plain dull and there's nothing good coming out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So depressing","review":"I didn't finish the book, and usually I wouldn't write a review for a book I didn't even finish. I just feel like I want to warn people about how bleak and depressing this book is. It just makes you sad. The writing is good, but reading it actually made me depressed. I am not a moody person. The book is just a major downer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It","review":"Another book that won't be loved by all due to issues that other reviewers have mentioned.It can be difficult to keep all of the characters straight.The novel includes dark thoughts and secrets of the characters.As others have mentioned, it boils down to actions and consequences. Nearly everything that exists is impacted by choices and decisions we make or don't make at any given moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i hadn't read this......","review":"What a sad and depressing book. I gave it two stars because I didn't want to put the book down- I read it all the way through to see if there was to be any redemption in it. SPOILER HERE------Although there was ample foreshadowing about Jonah's 'sickness' and I wasn't surprised by his kidnapping the boy, this was anti-climatic and didn't add any depth to the plot. In the end, these characters were so pathetic, that reading the book was mostly a wasted day for me. How sad and without a purpose...these characters were boring, passive and without any redemptive value. Portraying loneliness is one thing, but this book is just sad and and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst book I have ever read","review":"While I realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story, \\"The Emperor has no clothes\\". Yes, Choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying. The \\"flipping back and forth\\" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner. In addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved. The kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived. It would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"This story bored the dickens out of me. The writing dragged on and on about subjects which were uninteresting and depressing. I agree wholeheartedly with R. Farmer. I am not a Pollyanna who only needs sunshine and smiley faces, but this was ridiculous. The characters were stuck in boring places with no desire to make things better for themselves. Talk but no action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"I bought this book based on the rave reviews, but I found it to be depressing not hauntingly beautiful. I couldn't identify with or like any of the characters.

About 1/3 of the way through I discovered there was a large chunk of the book MISSING, and a chunk of the later part of the book in it's place. This was extremely frustrating since I ordered it online, and I never finished the book. Now I have missed the window to return it. I am very disappointed and will probably never order from Amazon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An uncomfortable but good read","review":"The dog attack ripped me apart (no pun intended). It was hard for me to get beyond that scene, but I eventually did. Though this was a dark and somewhat melodramatic work, with characters that at times were hard to relate to, I found that I couldn't put it down, even though I wanted to. Oh, how I wanted to.The story did wander--sometimes aimlessly, and it did make me uncomfortable at times, but there was a sense of hope for an ending that might have some semblance of happiness. I suppose I was foolish to wish for that. The overwhelming sense of sadness was something I'd not experienced while reading a book, and yet, I can honestly say that despite how uncomfortable it made me, in the end I was glad to have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing....","review":"This book was amazing...Chaon writes with a poetry that I haven't read since Kerouac. And not that I'm comparing this book at all to Kerouac, per say, but Chaon writes with the same intensity...he weaves words together so that they flow effortlessly on the page, and then later, stay with you as you progress through the day. He truly makes you look at life with a different perspective. This book is about identity. About how it is formed...is it nature or nurture? Or do we create ourselves? The characters are so intricately linked, and the point of view is such that I have never read before...this book is truly a journey. I will probably reread it sometime again in the future, just so I can extract even more out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I'm reviewing this novel late; I read it a while back. But I am surprised at the majority of positive reader reviews. Like reading the prologue in Cunningham's The Hours, reading this novel's equisitely written first few pages was like having the icing before the cake and finding the cake itself bland and flat (and, well, so depressing, too, without being interesting, and dark without really terrifying, and the style itself throughout, irritatingly problematic).But there is a brilliance and depth of image in those first pages, and I hope that one day in another novel--or novella?-- this author--I think he's fairly young--will give whatever time it takes to sustain (for the most part) that same genius through to the end. I also loved the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this novel. I have long been a fan of Chaon's short stories. But somehow his first novel is not in the same realm.The book starts off very well, but soon devolves into a series of flat, disjointed snippets from various stages of the characters' lives. Unlike other readers, I am not at all put off by what some call \\"depressing\\" circumstances in a novel. Yet as I continued to read Chaon's book, I came to realize that I just didn't care about his characters. That's what bothered me the most. And for me, it was a struggle to continue reading about characters I don't care about. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this book after reading the mostly phenomenal customer reviews, but I just didn't like it nearly as much as the rest of you seemed to. The writing is good; I will say that. I think my main problem was how much I disliked the character of Jonah. It may sound too simplified to say I'm an animal lover, but honestly, I was miserable from the (near) beginning following the Doberman episode, which I blame on Jonah even if he was a child. And the later episode with another dog really seals my feelings toward him. I couldn't stand that sad sac weirdo. Troy I liked more, and there were times I felt empathy for him. All in all, I was glad to finish it and start a new book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Item?","review":"Interesting.

Btw, the price didn't justify the content. I read many business books prior to this one and surely expect that its content will be more in-depth since it cost a bit more than regular business book. But, everything that the author wrote is a common sense to me and it can be easily found via internet without reading a particular book. I flip back and read it fast since there's nothing really new for me. It's almost like wasting time when I read the book. I am really sorry for such negative comments but I feel that I had wasted time and money to read a book that I thought can benefit me/inspire me.

But that's a tall order when you realize it's actually based on Daniel Defoe's bawdy 1722 tome about the life and times of a woman forced to do all she can to escape poverty. As you can imagine, this includes things like selling her body, abandoning her numerous children, and stealing when necessary.Moll Flanders has a lot going for it: sumptous sets, earnest acting (if weak accents), and a heart set firmly in the right place. But the mistake made by screenwriter and director Pen Densham can only be described as a fear of flesh and blood. Moll is one-dimensional--caring, sweet, emotionally innocent. Her journey to self-reliance feels unearned, and is predictable and emotionally unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Sick Movie","review":"If you want to watch a really sick movie, this might be for you.

But the story dwells only on the dark side and is too difficult to watch for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I have never read the novel this is based on so my review is purely on the movie. I tuned in accidently to first watch this on TV and it caught my attention.The story being told to the girl was a great way to break up the story going back in time to Moll as she struggles to get out of the brothel and turns to drink. Since she turns to drink she is cheap to buy and thus great for the artist who needs a cheap model. Moll becomes his model and he falls for her and with time she also falls for him. But their happiness doesn't last long and Moll finds herself again faced with her past.Beautifully acted and the costumes and sets are devine. A story on the darker side of history.Recommended if you like a tale of adventure, love, betrayal and a mean-spirited villian :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Really the One You Wanna See. . .","review":"This adaption of Moll Flanders is only close to the book because of the main character. Robin Wright stars as the famous prostitute whom is married once, not seen as a murderous as Hibble (Morgan Freeman) tells us she was, only stole a ring, wasn't put in prison and she was mostly a nice woman through out. Trust me, you'll want to purchase the Masterpiece Theatre one. It is way, way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"At this point, why not make it an original story?","review":"This film has rather little to do with the novel it is supposedly 'based' on.At this point, why not make it an original story? Why pretend that this has anything to do with Moll Flanders? To tap into an existing market because of its name recognition factor? Shameful.If you are going to do your own thing, then do not pretend it is something else.And having decided to do \\"something else\\", then do something that is actually worthwhile!

Yes it doesn't follow the book, but for what it was written to be, it was excellent. The acting, costumes, and sets were wonderful. I just watched it last night as a matter of fact. Stockard Channing brings radiance to the screen as always. There is much to be appreciated. If you want better accuracy to the story, buy the masterpiece theater version. If you have an appreciation for great acting and art direction, buy both."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Moll Flanders","review":"This movie is so unlike the book that it should be illegal to call it by the same name! Daniel Defoe achieved one of the great early novels in Moll Flanders, and this version has completely castrated it. Robin Wright is weak (although it's really not her fault -- her role was hamstrung). And would can even imagine where Morgan Freeman's character came into the picture? There is no such character in the book. After the first 15 minutes of this movie, it isn't Moll Flanders at all. And it's a poor excuse for a story no matter what it's called. It's not a strong woman's story of triumph over adversity. It's a pathetic girl's story of whining and crying.Buy or rent Moll Flanders with Alex Kingston.

I haven't actually read the book, but a movie is a movie, and this was a good one in a category by itself. I absolutely loved the relationship between Moll and the artist (does it actually ever say his name?), it was so sad and happy at the same time. Some of the lines of the movie are simply so romantic they could make you cry by themselves (such as when Moll says to her small-pox stricken husband \\"If I could, I'd put my blood in you\\"). Coming from a girl who was raised on love stories by her mother- this is now one of my favorite \\"watch it again and again\\" movies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good...","review":"I looked for this film for some time.

This past year I had a fifth grade student that spoke (mostly) Spanish at home. I wanted to provide her with some books to help in her English instruction, as well as her reading (Spanish) enjoyment. I also needed some help in communicating with her and her younger siblings. This book helped me tremendously. I didn't become fluent in my communication, but she seemed to recognize that I was trying and that led to a very special and personal relationship. I owe my wonderful relationship with \\"Jennifer\\" to this book and the help it offered me!

Although I took 3 years of Spanish in high school, that was over 10 years ago and my Spanish is definitely rusty, to put it mildly. I knew I needed some help for my two week backpacking trip in Ecuador and Peru, and this book was perfect! First, it's only $2, so cheap for a physical book! Second, it was slim! It's skinner than a notepad, so it was great when I needed to pack light since I was backpacking (so I had to carry everything on my back while in transit between places). Third, it was basic and not complicated. I didn't need, or want, a comprehensive (read = thick) Spanish-English dictionary.

The book contains useful phrases that you'd need to know; however, they way they translate them into Spanish is almost overly proper and polite and if you were talking to any native Spanish speaker using these phrases, you would just seem awkward.

Sadly, there're not too many survival phrases and necessity words that are essential during traveling. For example, it's missing such concepts as \\"I'm allergic to milk,\\" or peanuts, or you name it. You won't even see such a common word as \\"el bano\\" (restroom) in this book. The author calls it some outdated word that is barely used anywhere. Yes, you can get by with this book if you're not allergic to anything and don't need to use a bathroom, and if your pocket is big enough to squeeze these space-wasting pages along with the maps, documents, money, camera, makeup and other essential things...

As it was I was looking for everyday phrases (per the title) and this was not it. I don't ride trains and buses and taxis and check into hotels and make dinner reservations on a daily basis. Nor do I go through customs, take boat rides and buy cigars. This is a book for people who are away from home and need phrases for transportation, lodging, restrooms, etc.There is a bare minimum of hello, how are you, and words like who, what, why, but not much that I would ever use in my daily life. I'd like to be able to converse with spanish speaking customers, and the parents of my children's friends who speak spanish. In my mind that would be everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Central America","review":"This book is definitely not for Costa Rican Spanish! There is a 1950's flavor to the phrases - that is, a rudeness and big-city arrogance to the phrases that reminds me of the way people spoke to each other as is the movie THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.

As a lover of Alan Moore's From Hell (a graphic novel about Jack the Ripper) and a lover of London's dark side, it caught my interest. But for me the writing was ultimately more turgid than dense, more aligned with the author's inner thoughts than the character's - and somewhat too clever to easily digest. (For example - and this is from memory since I don't still have my copy - if you can work out the exact meaning of \\"He knew he would finally act when his hands were firmly in his pockets\\", then you might enjoy this book more easily than me. Otherwise I can't recommend it.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive but mostly for Star Wars fans","review":"The other reviewer admonishes us to be sure to play with this set, but I have found that to be pretty difficult because the AT-AT model is kind of fragile.

It is fairly well made for the price and has allen head bolts to help secure it. The problem is that it is 'universal' and doesn't fit very well. At least not a Chinese MAK. It took a fair amount of time with a Dremel tool to make it half-way work, but it still wasn't secure. The problem is that the receiver cover is just not a good mount for a scope. I doubt that you could ever keep it zeroed. It might be okay with a cheap red dot where close enough is acceptable, but for anything else, buy a receiver mount or use the iron sights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, but I kinda like it better without","review":"It seems to work quite well on my inter ordinance AK-47 with very minor filing on the hole on the back.

The cover gave me a scare because I removed the mag on the AK and a small part fell out the gun I freaked a bit trying to figure out what it was, turns out its one of the nuts tacked on the dust cover. I dont recomend this cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I was worried about for my SAR-1 romanian AK initially, but the receiver cover was cut to exact specifications and fit like a glove.

I had to file down the length about 1/8th of inch (trying to keep shape even)then had to close the width by 1/4 of an inch so not to have open area on both sides which resulted in wavy sides,had to bend top support down to lessen free play. Rail was not centered to barrel or iron sight. Rubber mallet helped correct. Now I have a cover that fits and is centered...and beat to heck to acomplish.I do not reccomend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"AK receiver tri-rail","review":"It looks great, and was delivered quickly.

However, it has two serious problems. Firstly, it didn't fit without modifications made by filing and bending (it should have fit on my Egyptian Maadi as they are identical to Russian models). But the worst thing about this is that the receiver cover isn't a solid mounting area. It moves slightly and even the slightest movement will completely ruin your sights' zero. I can't trust a system that doesn't hold zero. What I eventually went with was having a gunsmith install a side plate then getting a detachable slide mount to put on that; and it works perfectly.

Rod Steiger is also great as the southern police chief who ultimately, however grudgingly, comes to respect Poitier's character despite his being a black man. Scott Wilson is notable here in an early role (more well known now for playing Scott Crossfield in The Right Stuff many years later).

This is a witty, often amusing little story, with dialog that you can practically hear and a mystery that remains a tantalizing, just-out-of-reach secret until the end. Both of the male characters are vitally human - Katya, the love interest, is superficially charming but strangely wooden, the first clue that something is seriously wrong with this picture. The plot epitomizes the old adage that love is blind; although the reader is not sure what the problem is, you know there is one, a discovery that Jean-Marc stubbornly refuses to see until it is literally forced upon him. This book is a little known gem; a quick, enthralling reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Summer To Remember","review":"I was sixteen,and just finished my grade school exams ( I belong to Bengal, in India) when I came across this exceptional book-I had read 'Shibumi', and 'The Main',both of which just bowled me over, and I had fallen in love with the style of Trevanian, a maestro de su genero, on every grounds! I fell in love with Katya, too--perhaps a little more than Jean Marc, who;s ideology made him a lovable character by his own rights--but my world became transmuted to darkness, in the oppressive summer afternoon, when I finished reading---I had grown up, and I was in love------the name Hortense, the name Katya----became the very centre of my being , at least for some time to come.

Can't explain...you just gotta read.He tested things I could never imagine. Turns out Trevanian has a heart. This book will fool you if you know the author. A good read, for sure.

It is also a guide book for those who choose to see on the ground the many historical sites across the state. For these, the author has provided a number of maps and detailed directions, including whether anything to see remains and whether the site is located on private property.With long careers in the Nevada National Guard and the Bureau of Land Management, Colonel Rathburn demonstrates clearly his familiarity with Nevada and its military history.

And together they fell, both resigning on the last day of April 1973 as the heat from the Watergate scandal began to scorch the second term President who had been reelected by a landslide only months before.

As a punk dyke in my twenties, I feel obligated to say that this is NOT what the scene was or is all about--at least not in the first few chapters.Read Bett Williams' GIRL WALKING BACKWARDS instead.

Most of the book reads like a box score of a tennis match. McEnroe describes matches in agonizing detail. I was amazed that he remembered these matches so explicitly; perhaps he watched video of them while writing the book. There is painfully little about his personal life. I read Tatum O'Neal's book just before this one, and was curious to read McEnroe's take on their marriage. While I admired him for not taking an opportunity to trash his ex, he doesn't disclose much about why their marriage failed, or why his current marriage succeeds.

When this book was recommened to me, I thought it would give me some answers. It did not. I was put off by how the chronic issue were not addressed. Surgery by an oral surgeon was not discussed.

Well it does and doesn't. The menu has a section for additional scenes, but no choice to watch them in the flow of the movie. Also it's missing scenes from the directors cut, notably the scene where Riggs is dealing with the sniper. For a Blu Ray release this should have had all the bells and whistles that the directors cut regular DVD had. Now yet again we'll have to wait for another \\"special edition\\" version that will include the extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie is tops but the HD-DVD could have been better","review":"Again Warner Home Video offers another non-extended version for the HD audience. I had hopes that this would be another pristine presentation a-la Blazing Saddles. True, this film was shot in the sometimes woefully soft 1980s. Still I felt that the transfer could have been better. Yes, it bests all previous home video incarnations. Perhaps WHV will put forth an extra effort when (and if) they release the extended cut on HD-DVD. Still, for now, this is the disc to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE Lethal Weapon...just not this copy.","review":"I'm a Blu-ray enthusiast, and a Lethal Weapon enthusiast. So, I was VERY disappointed in both the quality of the Blu-ray formatting for this (it looks like DVD quality), but what REALLY mad me upset is the fact that it's not the directors cut. I guess that perhaps it was a bit naive of me to assume that it would be, but come on, this is BLU-RAY we're talking about here! I was not impressed. Not to mention that the seller said it was in \\"Good Condition\\", but the spine and back of the sleeve was severely crumpled and torn. Had this been a good quality Blu-ray conversion, and it been the directors cut, I would have cared not regarding the crumpled sleeve. However, as it was not the case, the crumpled nature was the straw.P.S. I just checked on Amazon, and there's STILL no Director's Cut available. Until there is, I will not be buying any Lethal Weapon films on Blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK film not great transfer to Blu-Ray","review":"For one thing the menu on mine doesn't work and I cannot change the audio track or the subtitles.

The movie itself truly doesn't stand the test of time because it seems like pure drivel now and is not very relevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Love Lethal Weapon--DON'T BUY THIS DISC!","review":"I had gotten this disc in the four-pack that also includes Road Warrior and Swordfish. First off, it's not even in the proper aspect ratio (2.4:1)--it's essentially full-screen, in laymen's terms. This is also NOT the director's cut, so keys scenes, like the shooter at the school yard, are not in this film. Considering they're in a war against Blu-Ray, I'm not sure what prompted them to take and press a substandard edition to HD DVD, but bottom line is save your money and wait for them to do it right."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't an action movie","review":"Why there were three sequels to this is beyond me.

Gary Busey is excellent as the bad guy"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Action Drama","review":"This first \\"Lethal Weapon\\" is one of the best buddy movies ever made. An exciting blend of pathos, humor, and explosions. The story centers around a family man cop played by Danny Glover and his suicidal partner played by Mel Gibson. The beginning of their relationship is predictable enough, they dislike and distrust eachother. Then through a series of action scenes and explosions they start to bond and eventually become friends. This is all good stuff, and sets the stage for the enevitable sequel which is even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Point Is","review":"Four stars for the movie and extras themselves but there's no sense in releasing a Blu-ray with an unfinished slipshod transfer like this one's got.

Mel Gibson and Danny Glover star as two extremely mismatched cops; one is on the edge after losing his wife in a car crash, the other is a newly-turned 50-year-old just trying to keep alive. Together they're slowly learning to like each other; when they do, they'll have to try to take down a secret drug ring run by Vietnam vets. Richard Donner's directing is very good, from a witty script by Shane Black; the score, by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen, is one of the best and most jazzy film scores I've heard. There's plenty of action, plenty of thrills, but not plenty enough; you'll want this film to never end. An interesting version is this Director's Cut, which features more emphasis on Riggs' suicidal attitude. If you want action, if you want hilarious comedy, if you want non-stop entertainment - you want LETHAL WEAPON."},{"rating":"1","title":"80s action relic","review":"A cop who is starting to feel his age (Danny Glover) is teamed with a recent widower who just might have a death wish (Mel Gibson). The uneasy partnership is cemented when they run afoul of a major drug smuggling ring.The chemistry between Glover and Gibson, along with a terrific performance by Gary Busey as a fearsome enforcer, is the best thing about this movie. However, this is an action film, and the action is outlandish and uninteresting. The plot is dull and hits every cliché in the book. The climax is particularly egregious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Added scenes are worth it","review":"I won't waste your time by rehashing the film here. It's been out since '87 so I'm sure you've seen it by now. I really enjoyed the first two Lethal Weapon films and decided that they were worth adding to my budding DVD collection. I hesitated in purchasing the first release on DVD (without the added scenes) and I'm glad I waited! While the scenes don't add much time to the film, they do speak volumes in terms of characterization."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Best of the Franchise","review":"Mel Gibson's performance as the suicidal Detective Seargeant Martin Riggs is riveting. He makes you believe he really does have a death wish. The chemistry that developes between Riggs and Murtaugh is perfect for this genre.

I never tire of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lethal Weapon movie #1","review":"I am so glad this movie became available as Blu-ray. It is a classic cop movie with touches of wry humor.

Darker, more violent yet subtler than the follow-ups, this would have been a mundane buddy-buddy cop thriller were it not for the inspired casting of Gibson and Glover. Whilst it isn't exactly 'The French Connection' (at no time does it seem to take place in the real world) , it comes on strong enough for the silliness to not matter. It's worth watching on television, if only to see how the television people get around the swearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A journey to the imaginary, and beyond","review":"This is lush, generous talent.

The heroine is an indentured prostitute who enjoys pain mixed with sex, but who is also trained as a spy. The descriptions of her encounters with her \\"patrons\\" are a little graphic, but you can always skim over them. It is definitely not your ordinary alternate history story line, which makes it a fresh and intriguing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it","review":"An interesting book and one I wasn't sure, half way through, if I was going to finish it. It has a few themes I wasn't sure how they would play out and if I would like them, but I am glad i stuck with it as the themes ended up working with the story line instead of being for shock value only. This book ended up being a real joy to read and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Praise for Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was quite prepared not to enjoy Kushiel's Dart once I realized where the author was heading on the S&M; theme -- I tend not to enjoy graphic descriptions of sexual-related violence. Yet somehow Ms. Carey pulled me in spite of my reservations. The parts that could have upset me were brief, and were required for the plot.The book is not perfect -- I got lost quite a few times with the intricate conspiracy because of so many names and titles. Sometimes you'd hear a first name, a family name, or a title. I am usually quite good at keeping up with complicated plots, but a few places I missed important things that I usually wouldn't miss.Yet in spite of these flaws, I still give this book 5 stars, which I rarely give out in my reviews ... -- the book was compelling, unique, and I in particular enjoyed the alternative history of the scion's of half-fallen Angels."},{"rating":"2","title":"hot, heavy, and good","review":"When my friend pushed me to read these books I thought to myself 'another porny book? Do I really need to?' I had picked up the books, or seen them around, but never purchased them. However once I got around to it, I was glad I had. This book is fabulous. Looking at the map it didn't take me long to realize Carey had based her fantasy world off of the real one, adding touches of realism to her story that are always enjoyable. Phedre is a believable and likable character, starting off stubborn and more than a little self centered and evolving from there. It's one of those stories where you hate the bad guy, and love the good guy, but you're not really sure who is on what side until the very end. (And even then, there is a twist.)At the end I found myself falling in love with all of these characters (and buying the next two books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was better the first time around when it was called MAIA","review":"After reading all the great reviews, I paid for the hardcover expecting a great fantasy read. However, I was disappointed overall. While I admire many of the descriptives - the author has crafted some beautiful passages, I think this book is very similar to Richard Adams' Maia. It is difficult to read Kushel's Dart and not compare it to Maia. Unfortunately, it doesn't measure up to Maia in the comparison. What I look for in a good fantasy read is a believable fantasy world. I don't think the fantasy holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I only spent a dollar","review":"Very disappointed...got it from the book bin at the local thrift store. I thought to myself, why would anyone give away such a seemingly good book. But I now see why.......very wordy. Author obviously was never taught that less is often more. Though the story had lots of potential, I couldn't force myself past chapter 6. I kept hoping it would get better and it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"I found this book incredibly annoying. It was recommended to me by several friends and I ploughed through it in hope the story would improve. It never did.First, the author's style is excessively verbose. Throughout the book, you'll find phrases like \\"I measured my length upon the ground.\\" What is wrong with saying, \\"I fell\\"? Another aspect of the author's style is to overly-beautify *everything*. Nothing is *ever* dirty, or ugly, or rotten, or bad.Second, the only character with some depth, personality, and motive to him died less than a third of the way into the book. I almost gave up on the book there. I should have; it would have been a better ending.Third, as if the main character was not enough of a perfect doll-puppet, the author chose to pair her up with a perfectly devoted ideal and idealistic warrior-paladin.For me, this book offered disappointments at every turn."},{"rating":"1","title":"set in the world of gobbedegook","review":"Having purchased this book on the basis of the reviews I read ,I'm sorry to say I just could not stay with it , I would strongly recommend anyone thinking of buying this to read a few sample pages before purchase , the names given to the kingdoms,the countries , and the characters made it impossible for me to follow , I can only presume its a slow burner , I could find no empathy with any of the characters , no sense of a plot developing , and by the time I had read about 30% no interest in turning the next page ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot bogged down by detail","review":"Although the main character and the overall plot are pleasing and well developed, the main storyline is too crowded by pointless details. Carey adds too many political people with complicated histories and backgrounds for one to even follow it. I found myself constantly forgetting who was who and what they did 5oo years ago with this person who was the son of this person who did whatever. On top of that the main character, however likable, is a prostitute that does some pretty graphic things just to please her patrons, all in the service of her \\"godess\\". In the end she sells herself for for money towards her freedom. It doesn't exactly send the best message out to young women. After the first book I was so overwhelmed with the amount of rather pointless information that I couldn't bring myself to finsish the series. However, for people who have the patience to remember overwhelming detail and believe prostitution in the name of an idol is fine, this book is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, sado-masochists will love it...","review":"....if you are not one of them, however, may I recommend something else? ANTHING else, in fact?There is something unduly sad about reading an author who might be a talented wordsmith if not for the fact that this is one long playout of her warped sexual fantasies. I don't demean or condemn this kind of literature; certainly it has its place among people who get off on scenes of cutting and abuse, rape and torture. How lovely. The involvement of children is quite disturbing to me personally, but again, I guess if you're into erotica, you will love this book. I just expect a little more high fantasy and less sexual leather fantasy from Tor. Perhaps they should rename the publishing house TORE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The paperback costs the same?","review":"This review is for the price of the Kindle version.I've read this book. I've read the sequels. I enjoy this author and her characters.I bought a Kindle to hold a number of books in one area without taking up the space that even one paperback does (I'm in the Navy; I don't have room to take too many books on deployment) AND because in my mind, ebooks should be cheaper than physical because there are less producing costs.So why on earth is the Kindle price for these books the same as a paperback? What is the point of buying a $150 electronic storage for books that don't have any further content than the words on the screen, to pay a price for a physical copy that takes up more storage and can be lent/resold/given away, etc? Wouldn't publishers make more money by supplying more ebooks and cheaper costs since it's harder to transfer those files than a physical book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definetly NOT Fantasy","review":"I did not like it.

By the time I was done reading this one, it felt like I had read 3 book's worth of information, as this one is very involved and will take you through many different tales.

I am anxiously awaiting the 2nd book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have to admit I was skeptical when it was compared to Dune. But it does not disappoint. Plan ahead to have plenty of spare time to read, because Carey has created a page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite!","review":"I absolutely love this book and the books after it. I think they're beautifully and eloquently written, and I personally found them easy to read. If you're used to books written on a 6th grade reading level, then no, this book isn't for you. Where some authors use a paragraph or more to describe a physical setting, Carey conveys emotions, sights, smells, etc in a sentence or two. I just really admire her style of writing and how well it complements her story. I feel it's also a well balanced novel. Phedre, the main character, is a highly trained courtesan with a proclivity for pain, but also a keen intelligence geared towards spying for her master and teacher. Some erotic scenes are described in detail, but if you're looking for a trashy novel, this isn't it. Although Phedre is a prostitute, her life evolves around much more than sex, and intrigues are complex and very widespread, requiring her talents outside the bedroom as often as inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It manages to create a completly believable world & a very engaging heroine.It also is very erotic with a S&M flavor to it. For me this was a plus but sensitive readers beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of THOSE books","review":"It's such a treat to find a book with so much woven together, and done well. While it's not in our universe, it is in a parallel one that mirrors our own in a beautiful fashion.I found the story just a bit difficult to get into -- the first 50 pages or so were good, but not completely absorbing. Then, suddenly, I found that all I wanted to do was read this book and find out what happened now. The twists and turns were such that you just HAD to know!! I didn't want to work, didn't want to sleep, and discovered that long stop lights and heavy traffic were a good thing. (CAUTION: I do not recommend that.)It's also one of those that has such an after-glow about it that it's difficult to go on to the next book.Highly engaging, but be prepared to lose some sleep over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark fantasy rears its beautiful head...","review":"This is not your fluff romance twisting a world for it's own games. Here we find a world similar to our own Europe set in a golden age of indulgence, political intrigue, and desire.I'm going to safely assume that you can read the back of the book and the few look inside pages, so I won't presume to fill you with plot information as already done.What I will tell you is this is not for the faint of heart - when they discuss the pain & pleasure are felt as one, you will read of acts of pain to incite pleasure. You will read of a brutal murder or two. Don't pick this up if you're squemish.But, if you enjoy books with as much action as romance, a storyline including a love unable to be shared, ones that twist the world we know to fit their designs, and you want a well wrapped tale, by all means, pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing story","review":"Serving over here in Kuwait I purchased this novel last year and only just read it. I was so impressed with the writing and character development, as well as the protaganist herself, that I quickly lost myself. I am eagerly anticipating the next novels which I plan to purchase ASAP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good read.","review":"I bought this book when the second book in the series caught my eye. And how could it not? The artwork on the cover is fantastic. The book itself is well written, without any detectable grammar or spelling errors. The author's style is good and it was very easy to connect to the characters and fall in love with them. The book is a little fuzzy near the end about what happens to the main character and her guardian, but other than that it was wonderful. If you like cunning and book full of plots and counterplots, then you should like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Moves slower than molasses! I read a short story by Jacquiline Carey and loved it, but it just doesn't translate into a full length novel. Ms. Carey is constantly hinting at what's to come, but never seems to get to the point, and I feel no empathy whatsoever for any of the characters. I feel like I've been reading this story for months, but am only 30% done on my Kindle - yikes! Unfortunately, this will be a book I'll finish when I have nothing else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding.","review":"I probably own over 200 sci-fi/fantasy novels, and have read at least twice that. Carey's trilogy is easily one of the most politically intricate; Kushiel's Dart sports characters that are almost tangible with very human flaws and strengths set in a background with enough similarities to real settings for the reader to feel like he knows the world. While I'm not a fan for Phedre's particular sexual quirks, they did not in any way detract from the book and actually helped her character's developement. Her courage as a writer is to be admired as well; her writing style and level inevitably eliminated a great deal of her potential audience, and it's nice to see that there are still a couple of authors out there that have enough self-respect and respect for their audience to not hold back. Outstanding. Buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"The world she creates is very detailed and sensual.

So they just take the map of Europe, muddle up the names of things and write as if they are writing alternative history (which they aren't).Beautiful, boring and smug people engaging in lots of silly mock-sophisticated sex and boring political intrigue. I don't think I can remember any time that an author managed to maintain such consistent shallowness over such a long book.And it seems that there are multiple sequels. I'm stunned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the *Worst*","review":"There were WAY too many names in this book for me to keep track of. I realize that most people don't have as much difficulty with this as I do, which is why I gave two stars instead of one, but I can't help that it colored my opinion. I had an impossible time following who was backstabbing who, which made me concentrate on faults that I normally would have let slide. The sex scenes are boring, the characters are cookie-cutter, and the author rambles on and on and on. It gets some points for having a *slightly* more original setting than many other fantasy series, and for not using magic as a trump card in every scene, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am underwhelmed","review":"Based on the ravishing reciews, I thought I was reading the new Great American Novel.Uh, no.It's certainly readable writing, and if you can stomach the sex, and the fact that the author uses S&M as her gimmick, than this book will probably fascinate you. It's a little like watching a train wreck at first; the first few instances can be seen as daring. After a while it gets old.Outside the sex there's little to recommend this book. I found the god imagery unimaginative and the character development lacking.I also want to know why Tor is marketing this as a debut, making everyone say, \\"WOW! What a wonderful first book!\\" when it's NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intellectually Offensive","review":"I find all the slathering of praise on this book to be silly. Certainly the author is literate, but the prose is one big self-gratification that I prefer not to participate in. I am not offended by the sex itself--even though all the bodice-ripper descriptions of \\"hard veined phalluses\\" hardly impress to the level I expected after a gushing Kirkus review. It is the persepctive that is bothersome. Perhaps few other readers don't take offense at the sort of content that abounds in this tasteless book, but if you put golden wrapping on manure, it's still manure; you can foist it off on a lot more people, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad porn","review":"I bought this book because it was so heavily hyped, but it turned out to be mess of stilted prose, overly demanding plot details, and bad sadomasochistic porn. Every sentence rings of foolish bombast, the characters have no emotional appeal, and I felt so manipulated I had to throw the book across the room. I have tried to pick up the book again, being a third of the way through, but it repels me again and again. I am no literary snob, I read science fiction and some fantasy all the time, and I am no literary lightweight, enjoying Henry James as much as the next guy, but this piece of marketing mush failed to appeal at any level. The book reads like it was started on an alt.sex newsgroup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Author Comments","review":"I was asked by Tor to review this book a couple of months ago - now I regret that I took so long to pick it up!\\"Kushiel's Dart\\" is a stunning book - the fact that it is a debut novel makes it even the more remarkable. It is anything but your run of the mill fantasy - it is sophisticated, daring, 'take it to the edge' fantasy ... that is, it is one of the best fantasy books you'll find on the shelves this year ... it is one of the best _books_ you'll find on the shelves this year.This has to be a must-read. I loved reading it - I regret not writing it! But wait, there's going to be two more books! Can it get any better?The buzz from inside publishing circles is that this is going to become one of the genre's classics. I commend Tor for picking it up (and then for being wise enough not to cut the guts out of it in editing to suit the faint-hearted), and I commend Jacqueline for writing it.

Jacqueline Carey starts an epic series with this amazingly addictive, sensual, dramatic story that will keep the reader turning pages, staying up later than planned, and rushing to the store to buy the next book in the series. A word to the wise: buy the first 3 books (1. Kushiel's Dart, 2. Kushiel's Chosen, 3. Kushiel's Avatar) together so you don't get antsy waiting for the next book to come out. I don't like Sci-Fi/Fantasy, but I'm totally in love with Jacqueline Carey's work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely A Good Read","review":"I'm a fan of the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. My cousin suggested this book to me a few years back. This is my second time reading it, and it's even better. It's full of political intrigue and sensuality. You'll definitely enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bla!!!","review":"I kept seeing this book everywhere I went, it was always in the shelves of recommended/popular books so I figured I'd give it a try. I was terribly disappointed. While the story itself is entertaining and the world and culture Carey creates is fairly imaginative and beautiful, the language and narration describing it was bland. I kept reading solely to find out how the story would turn out. The narration felt distant and I had a really hard time caring about the characters. And for being a story about a courtesan in a society that is so open about sex, never was there a mention of birth control. We could have had a little more realism with a contraceptive ritual that would have fit in perfectly. But no, it's just a sex laden fairy tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the time it took to write","review":"I love books... old, new, classic, modern... rare to find a written word not worth reading..Until now. Too many words describing nothing. The plots seems like it was thought of over a 12pk and as a way to link bad sex scenes.This is the unfortunate product that publishers are schlepping at us because we want sex and and something to make us feel like our own lives arn't that bad. The ONLY thing that is good about this compared to everything else coming from the fantasy genre is that is DOES NOT have vampires in it.There are some great historical novels out there that are worth every penny. Stick to those and save yourself from tedium."},{"rating":"1","title":"A chore","review":"This is quite possibly the worst book I have read in sometime. I quit around page 200, and I commend those that went further.Disguising itself as an erotica book, but failing in every possible way in that aspect? Check. Bland, boring, grating prose? Check. Laughable dreary Mary-Sue of a main character? Check. Raping a major religion because author lacked any creativity? Check! I could go on, but you get the point.This book is bad Alternate Universe Biblical fanfic. I thought, in the beginning it might get better, but it actually got more boring, more repetitive and just downright annoying for me to give it any of my attention any longer. I think I need to read some Nabokov to cleanse my brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just don't get the hipe","review":"I'm sorry, but I just don't understand all the praise. I read constantly. I can usually complete a book within three to four days regardless of the size, and I've been known to go on all night read-a-thons (to my husbands aggrivation). Yet, I could not continue to force myself to finish this book even after an entire week of trying to get through the dull, unorignial pages. Out of 925 pages I only made it to 112. I even tried scanning ahead (looking for some sort of action or interest). Needless to say, I found none."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book.

I completely fell in love woth Joselin. 'He has replaced my first and only character love Haplo\\" With deep undertones of religion and heavy with politics, there is not much magic.

I made it through 652 pages before I finally called it quits.

Once again we have breathless abandon of praise that is really very overblown [though explicit sexuality and S$M sometimes does that to people--I'm convinced that's why Terry Goodkind has a following.] To be fair, Carey is a better writer than Goodkind, but she has the same tendency to exploit the sex rather than really thinking out the society. In addition, her heroine has no vulnerability, and it's hard to root for such a know it all on any but the parody level. The \\"we're Phedre's boys!\\" song to me was SO anachronistic it made me want to scream.On the other hand, the sex is not the offensive part of this stroy. It's the reliance on it and the fact that this somehow yields praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"major eye rollage","review":"I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at some scene or event. I liked Phedre, for the most part, but found her love-interest Joscelin to be annoyingly weak. He's suppose to be her body guard, but he's a wimp.Carey created a beautiful society with an interesting culture and completely lost me by using our own world as the setting. Was it just too difficult to create her own version a barbaric society, so she planted the Vikings in the story, instead?I've been told that you have to read the series to understand (\\"love\\") the whole story, but I just can't get myself to pick up the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betimes I Review A Book?","review":"The writing is excessively florid, and the fancypants archaic words are often used incorrectly. For instance, I really wish Ms. Carey's editors would let her know that betimes means early, not \\"at times.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love a good epic story but Kushiel's Dart is not one of them. I had to force myself to get though the first 300 pages and then I gave up.There was no excitment and I had no interest in the main character who to me comes off as shallow and emotionless. None of the characters were interesting enough to keep me involved, a page turner it's not.I had high hopes for the book but it wasn't exciting, erotic or an adventure, everyone just seems bored and jaded. Yet I suppose if your entire life worth is based on your skills as a high priced courtesan then you're going to be jaded, but it still doesn't make you interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars for Ms. (Mary Sue) Carey","review":"I don't get the hype. It's wordy and flowery concoction of nothingness. Phèdre is little more than a Mary Sue wannabe. Mary Sue (Phèdre) does everything perfectly, says the right things, does the right things, and is in the right place at the right time at every turn of the book. The evil characters in this book fall all over themselves to get Mary Sue to bed and have a mind blowing (epiphany) orgasm, and is praised for giving them the best sex they ever had.I agree with the one brave reviewer who calls Ms. Carey on her over used flowery antiquated use of flat prose to describe a sex act, when the sex act is about BDSM. BDSM has nothing to do with romance or flowery prose.I hope the author will reimburse me not only for the 7.99 paid for the book, but for the 4 days that it took for me to read this badly written tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"while this book starts out with names and titles that are initially difficult to remember, you start to learn and love the characters; their tragedies are your tragedies. The plot of the book is deliciously twisted, and leaves you breathless. The main character, Phedre, is dark yet innocently sexy. The plot of the story is not like the repetitive stuff churned out in mass, it is different in that the hero, or more triumphantly, heroine defeats the bad guy using not strength or magic but the gift of her sexuality and knowlege instilled in her. She is obviously sexy, but thankfully she is intelligent. She is not perfect, in truth her flaws are shining marks that make her human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun","review":"While this book might not be for everyone due to the BDSM eroticism, it is superbly written. The geography and cultures consist of both fantasy and historical elements blended very well. Clearly the author has traveled and researched.For anyone interested in historical fantasy not afraid of sexual elements, I strongly recommend this book.Also, I would have to add that the author uses suggestion more often than graphic representation on the sexuality end, which I feel is a much better way to approach the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Thanks for a great book. Does great to find obscure books. This is a great series. Bought the set and love them. Great author!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Relax...","review":"This book is phenomenally crafted. Once you get over the initial shock of massachism (spelling?), you realize that the story wouldn't be the same without it. The romance of Joscelin is real, and thrilling. Every character is brought out with vibrant beauty, although some may seem one-dimensional. Carey illuminates the complexity of human relationships, especially those involving sexuality. Carey delves into a subject most authors stay safely away from, or dance around with cheesy euphemisms. Sexuality is a powerful force our society likes to deny, and this novel explodes with blatant examination of the touchy subject. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and its sequel, and am anxiously awaiting the third."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good. Nice plot twists.","review":"I loved this book. My friend recommended it to me, and I was a little hesitant. However, once I actaully started to read it, I really liked got drawn into it. I like how the politics were used in the story, because, truely, it is the main plot. It is all about politics. My one complaint was that there were so many important and semi-important people in the book. And normally I don't have a problem with this, but some of their names are very similar, and I kept getting confused. Also, minor charactures, suddenly become important several hundred pages later. And unlike some author's, Carey doesn't keep re-stating the same information about the same person over and over. Which I must say is a fresh breath of air. I also like have the people actaully develope through out the story, and aren't just the same through the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle Edition","review":"THIS REVIEW IS OF THE KINDLE EDITION ONLY, NOT THE BOOK, which has been well reviewed by others.The Kindle edition of this book is VERY badly formatted.

The religious aspect didn't help.The world, based on medieval europe, wasn't imaginatively constructed. This itself isn't so bad, but the lack of imagination seemed to spill over into other parts of the book as well, such as the characters and religion, which were at most variations on various well-known, standard forms.The prose seemed ponderous to me.

I have read reviews that put it down for not being angry and realistic enough. My impression was that there was a lot of realism, but told with warm generosity of spirit. This is the autobiography of an African-American woman growing up in DuQuoin, Illinois in the early 1900's. It has a special fascination for me because it also the place and shortly before the time when my Mother was growing up in DuQuoin and where a number of my relatives still live.

Everything is programatic. I followed it through the chapter. It was difficult to follow and to set up. When I got to the end of the chapter, it said data flow (a common use of SSIS) was beyond the scope of the chapter and referred the reader to Books Online.My experience is that you might as well use Books Online as this book.

For a book that says \\"Programming\\" in the title, I would expect a thorough examination of discussing the old AND new of SQL Server, but this text decides to focus on the new gadgets and abilities that the 2005 generation provides, without focussing specifically on the existing programming features/abilities.At nearly 600 pages this book sounds like it's a good amount of material, but for any book that says programming and with a topic so diverse, I would expect more.If you are looking to find out more about what SQL Server 2005 provides, create some applications that talk to your database server using the Visual Studio 2005 suite and get up to speed, this is a nice resource, but I cannot give it 5 stars as it just doesn't jump off the page for me like I would have hoped.**** RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and inaccessible","review":"This book is very inaccessible, not because it is too complex, but because it is poorly written.

I found it to be metaphorical enough to merit a second and perhaps a third and later on a fourth and fifth watching. I am interested in the concept of an old man binding a group of followers to the memory of his charismatic and dead teachings for a long while, even though they themselves have lost sight of any truth in anything he might have taught. Religion deadens passion and enjoyment and truth and the capacity for relationship. People will gladly substitute the memory of a dead man's teaching for pleasure, whether it be in eating or drinking or exploring one's God given gifts... whether it be love, or children, or learning. People believe they have made a good trade. Because they have failed to face life, they have not made mistakes, and because of this they believe they are good.

I know that good acting may consist only of a silent glance, a raised eyebrow, a frozen gesture; but for me even these were lacking. Perhaps the author and director intended only for us to watch the isolated, inward, emotionally repressed community, and to reflect on its warning; but the movie did not imply or hint this.

I don't know what a modern viewer could possibly take from this film, other than to be thankful that most men today now see women as friends and companions, perfectly equal in moral, spiritual, and intellectual capacity, and vice versa.For a depiction of the \\"wild woman\\" who rolls through town and scandalizes the populace with her sensuous cooking skills, I prefer Chocolat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"Watched this again and it holds up very well to repeat viewings.

Frankly, the DANISH - FRENCH with subtitles is much more enjoyable. So I recommed using THAT CHOICE which you get on a DVD.Here's another way of enjoying this movie. Just picture the cast of colorful ACTORS just being themselves after every scene.They are cast in their roles of being these dreary Danish Protestants stuck in a place without a tree or flower or a blade of grass to lighten up the monotony.

I wish I could have been sitting at that table enjoying the feast!One suggestion - the movie is subtitled and on the DVD you can listen to it in English. DON'T DO IT!

A word of advice if you want a library collection of this type of metal just try to buy a single from what ever random band of power matal, it can be either stratovarius, blind guardian whatever, and listen to just one song, and there is your power metal library, in other words it all sounds the same: melody, repetitive double bass drum.... and terrible 80's vocals.There was only one band that could truly play this type of metal to perfection, and that band was Helloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE IT!","review":"How original is my above title? anyway, this CD contains some of the most amazing energy I've ever heard from a group. Wings of Destiny could very well be one of my all-time favorite songs! I think the first few songs and the last few songs starting with Wings of D are very good.. the middle songs including Heavy Metal Universe and the Metallica-like Short as Hell don't quite measure up... I truly believe that GRay does better sticking to their 'guns', so to speak, by blasting out those beautiful and frenzied choruses of melodies... as opposed to diversifying their sound or perhaps experimenting with other bands' sounds. I'm not sure which I like better - Land of the Free or PowerPlant - but if the recent reviewer is right in saying that Somewhere o i Space is better than both of them... well... I can hardly wait to hear it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"nowhere near as good as Somewhere Out In Space","review":"this follow-up to Somewhere Out in Space is nowhere near as good. Fewer great melodies and lyrical ideas. Closer in content to the album prior to SOIS, Land of the Free, but with the great drumming of Dan Zimmerman. Kai's vocals not as good as on SOIS. Still, there are some nice uptempo tracks such as: Gardens of the Sinner, Wings of Destiny, and Armeggeddon.

Ragtime Feast is a delightful and authentic rendering of choice ragtime tunes. Okay, everyone is entitled to a bad 'hear' day, but I doubt others will come away with the same ill-humour or surly mood of the first reviewer, after listening to this music.

The sound quality is really really poor - the piano sounds like one of those midi-files you can hear on the home pages offering rolls for your electric piano, and several tracks are ending with a loud \\"click\\" as if this was a sloppy homeburn. The artist is playing at a mechanical pace, only slowing down and loosing the rythm at the difficult passages. (That's why I'm guessing there is in fact a piano player and not a paper roll behind the performance). And the four-pages \\"booklet\\" comes from a cheap home printer.

It's a powder so you can add more to adjust the flaovr which I like, plus you can save a lot of money since the price is so much lower. They're very comparable. Both are flavorful and really do justice to black teas.I love black tea and they are the only two types I've stuck with for longer than a month.

They are really convenient to use and easy to take along in tea bag form. I also get the loose leaf version at (which is bolder) at Starbucks for under 7 dollars a tin. It is a nice mixed flavor of English Breakfast (Twinings brand is best for English Breakfast in my opinion) and ever so slightly Earl Grey and other black teas. The Tazo Awake black tea is not as strong as some but bold in flavor or aroma, the loose leaf version by Tazo is even more so. I don't drink caffeine in the form of sodas or coffee but I do drink lots of tea and I don't ever feel wired or caffeine'd out after a few cups of tea each day. Tazo has impressed with both their loose leaf and tea bag versions. Seep it long enough to get the bold color, flavor and aroma but don't over do it as the tea will have bitterness if you leave it seeping too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"why the huge rise in price?","review":"I agree -- this tea will make you quit coffee!

The set is marked 18/10 and is nice with the exception of the knife. First, it feels light and hollow - it's lighter than the other pieces which makes no sense since it's made of the most material. I see no marking on it indicating it's Oneida, let alone 18/10. Astonished, I tried to bend the blade and it definately gives under little pressure. (Not a full bend, but a knife shouldn't flex). Looking more closely at the designs along the handle, it almost appears that black paint was used to create depth, as opposed to actual molds.I'm curious to see if ordering directly from Oneida yields a better product, or if there is just a lapse in quality. 18/10 - lies!

I gave this 2 stars because although there is some good material on here (and very kinky), there is just too many weird, obscure, or plain not sexy tracks. It seems like the CD was trying to include a wide variety of tastes both erotic and artistic. The problem is that people who by it for the erotic value (which I believe is the largest market) are just going to shake their head at some of the \\"artistic\\" choices. Overall, there was no focus to the CD. It went from erotic to funny to irritating to bizarre. If you take just the erotic tracks, you end up with about five. Of those, each individual may find only 2 or 3 that appeal to them.[$$$]for 2 or 3 good erotic tracks is a little too much.

The necromancer starts very weak and grows godlike. The psionist starts powerful and grows godlike. THE PSIONISIST IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE DM! The psionic spells (\\"abilities\\") are more powerful than mage spells, they don't give one saving throws, and they go by a point system (giving a wider variety of spells, making them more powerful) This class unbalances everything.

I do not mind if Psionics are included in my campaign, you know hell half your enemies have then, there might as well be at least one character or a good aligned NPC with the abillity to fight back on even terms. I think every DM should allow the class to be available , just in case a player would like to try one on for size, besides you gives you the DM a chance to learn how to deal with them in your worlds.

The blend reminds me of some of the great duos of our recent times: Fagan and Becker, Loggins and Messina, Crosby and Stills, Simon and Garfunkel, Hall and Oates, even Lennon and McCartney. Behind each of these duos was excellent songwriting, flawless musicianship, and exceptional harmony. Straw Dogs plays the kind of music that makes you glad to be alive on Earth.

The book artlessly documents how her deliberate choices led to unwanted--but not surprising--results. She leaves college, employment, and marriage because she finds them banal. Declares it would \\"be stupid to get pregnant\\" when she isn't financially stable, yet goes off the Pill and has one child after another. A dreamer, not a doer, with delusions of grandeur, she only occasionally questions her actions. The title is a misnomer, and the book detracts from the plight of the real homeless without nets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not credible -- a mother's false tale","review":"Oh, what a sorry alternative to Nickel and Dimed.

But she creates phony characters -- a colorful landlord, a physician's wife who decides to do childcare for $2 an hour, friendly cops. Baloney.

Maybe that helped her live out of her car?? Most would have tried to live with friends or family but she didn't want people to know and toughed it out.

It's not that good for what CSS is capable of doing either and the options associated with it. Overall, this book really isn't any good for someone that has experience.

You then open notepad again to create the html file, one that imports the style.css file. If you don't know how to do this, then just stop reading and get this book.)

Furthermore, the villain in this one just isn't scary, with her overwrought lines and lame \\"I'm in charge\\" banter; the sleazeball from \\"Coffy\\" was better because we didn't know exactly how the chips were going to fall until the very end. That tension is missing here, save for one scene where Grier is tortured and abandoned in a gruesome way. We actually get to feel a little tension.However, I still feel that this below-average \\"follow-up\\" is more than a little disappointing, especially since \\"Coffy\\" really set a high bar, with a great cast driven by a lot of exciting dialogue and plot twists.

This 1974 AIP film offers better production values than others from the same stable.Musicand costumes are dynamite. Even the camerawork is good, the editing less disjointed than in some films of this era. And it's not without humor, either; the double entendres with the two hookers and the judge were LOL hilarious, plus the time Foxy hides a gun in her 'fro.Grier holds her own against predominantly male leads in this genre--the pickle-jar emasculation of a tough guy here is notable, as is Foxy's rape by rednecks--thus making this essentially a sexploitation film, too. It must be said, however: Tarantino's homage is a much better film, and furthermore, the actress improved with age. So enjoy the best of both worlds and watch 'em as a double feature.

Hill's cartoonish screenplay gives Pam Grier nothing to work with in this cheesy revenge yarn that's more about skin instead of substance. She wants revenge for the murder of her boyfriend by the syndicate and will do anything to get the satisfaction of retribution. Almost every one of the paper-thin characters is just there for her to kill, maim, or injure. The film goes from campy to downright silly when a henchman gets ground up by an airplane propeller and the absurdity reaches a climax when Foxy pulls a pistol out of her Afro. Ugh! To see Pam do this right, get Coffy or the far superior Jackie Brown. And avoid the Halle Berry remake coming up.

This one is the closest.What I like most about the stand is the foot (or base), in that it is wide enough to hold the instrument in plase without tipping over, even if it is struck accidentally. Another strong point for me is the unique design of the stand which enables it to be stored in the bell of the horn when not in use. When you want to use it, removal is easy. Just pull it out of the bell. The next step is to unscrew toe securing devise at the bottom of the stand to release the supports - tighten the securing devise and place it where you want it and stand your horn on it.You are able to be comfortable with the safety of the stand in most settings, especially when there is not much traffic.

Hope she doesn't have a sequel in mine.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Anne also suffer from the curse?","review":"As an avid fan and owner of every book she's published I was VERY disappointed in the storyline, plot, sub-plot, character development (actually lack there of), dialog, I can go on.When the story moves into dream sequences it's disjointed, choppy and is like flipping channels and watching a movie that has been on for over an hour.I haven't finished the book, I have no desire, inclination or motivation to. I stopped reading the book a week ago and haven't felt the urge to pick it up again. I am barely 1/2 way through the book.I feel like I wasted money. I feel robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a curse","review":"This is a first (and last) Catherine Coulter book I've read, or at least tried to read. What started out with great potential very quickly became a confusing, error-ridden mess. The only question I have is did this book not have to pass through editing? It is simply a mess, just a bunch of words on paper bounded together to impersonate a book. Shame on the publisher!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantasy and medieval romance, what more can you ask?","review":"When I first got this book I was reluctant to read it because I had just finished Rosehaven, which i disliked very much, but once I started I was plensently surprised. The characters are much more likeable and romance is much more probable. This is a very good story that blends medieval life and fantasy perfectly. Although the two romances had to be shorter, they were both very well develped and sweet. I loved trying to figure out how they were related and how the mystery would end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just skip it","review":"Please just don't bother with this Catherine Coulter novel. It had major potential - a mystical/creative/unusual plot concept, but the extremely disjointed narrative and the ending leave you unfulfilled and frustrated. Basically, there are two stories here, one in the \\"present\\" time and one even further in the past. Unfortunately, neither story feels complete and Ms.Coulter is unable to weave these two complicated stories together in any coherent fashion, so you find yourself wondering what exactly is going on in practically every chapter. I say skip it and go with one of CC's much better novels (Impulse/Edge/almost anything!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This author has definitely written better books than this one. I was dissappointed with this novel, it goes on and on over the same thing, a romance between a witch and a wizard, and it was boring. The plot is totally confusing, with many irrelevant things, and of course, totally predictable: you know both couples will end together, no surprise there. I read it to the end because I always finish the books I start reading, but it was not worth the effort nor the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened???","review":"This is one of the most dreadful books I've ever read. When it finally rained I felt like going outside and doing a rain dance. I dislike very few of C.Coulter's books, and this one is right up there with the bad. I've been trying to finish this book for about a month, that's how bad it is. Of course this is only my opinion. I'm being very generous giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Penwyth Curse","review":"I usually love Catherine Coulter's work, but this was unsatisfactory. I did'nt even finish it. I got to CD #7 and gave up. Too many witches and wizards for me. And the plot was hard to follow. I donated it to my local library. Maybe someone will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish","review":"I don't remember the last time I could not finish a book until this one. I made it about half way and just could not go on.

I can't believe Catherine Coulter wrote this garbage. Boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad...","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author, and I don't think I will bother with any of her other books. I picked it up as a frequent reader of historical fiction, but I like most any book set in England during the middle ages. The dialogue was repetitive and contrived, and the characters were flat. I did finish the book just to see how creative the conclusion to the mystery was handled. Unfortunately, not very well. Many questions were left unanswered. It almost seems as though the author just keeps repeating and obsessing on the aspects of the story she has worked out, while trying to think up a satisfying ending. If the subject matter and appeals to you, try Michael Criton's \\"Timeline\\" or Connie Wells' \\"Doomsday Book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge Catherine Coulter by this book!","review":"Don't judge Catherine Coulter's historical romances by this book! They are nothing like this. In most of Coulter's romances, her characters are rich and well thought out, and you \\"feel\\" everything the characters feel. Not this one. It's proof that even the best writers lose their touch and eventually begin to write just for the money. Don't waste your time on this book - pick one of Coulter's earlier historical romances instead. Most of them are worth 4 or 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great adventure!","review":"I was a little discouraged after reading other reviews here but I was glad that I stuck with reading this one. What a great adventure! This is the reason I read. To go to the unknown, know that anything can happen and enjoy the happy ending. I enjoyed both stories very much. It makes me again a believer that EVERYTHING happens for a reason. I enjoyed all the charaters in these stories and the way the author wrote them. I loved the name \\"Bishop\\", how unique!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I love Catherine Coulter. Her books have always been a joy to read. This book does not reflect the Catherine Coulter I know. The story line and the characters were boring. It is obvious that the time was not taken to develop this story the way it should have been. Catherine Coulter and other romance writers have started focusing more on writing suspense books while still trying to write romance. If this is what romance readers get in the bargain then please leave the romance writing to those who will put the time and effort into giving us great stories with great characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst book I've ever read!","review":"Reading The Penwyth Curse, you almost believe there are two different writers at work - one moment you're reading fairly interesting dialogue and descriptions, and the next minute you read \\"it would be a very bad thing\\", and the words \\"simply\\" and \\"just\\" repeated dozens of times throughout the book! The worst? \\"she was so afraid she almost puked from it\\" Oh, puhleez!It had potential, but \\"just\\" didn't succeed. \\"Simply\\" didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tip #51: Dont buy this book","review":"I cant believe I bought this. It is completely outdated and has no real information. The book basically gives you 50 tips to improve your productivity. However, the tips are so basic that even an 18 year old intern could figure them out on the first week. Worthless information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Healthy Teaching on Repentance","review":"Having read other books by H.A. Ironside, and having a great deal of respect for William MacDonald, I thought the book would be a doctrinal but dry look at the Biblical teaching on repentance. It is a docrtinal look at repentance, but it is so much more.I liked H.A. Ironside's look at the main theme of the book of Job. What an insight! Brother Ironside's comments in passing on a particular translation of the Bible, reveal the mistranslation of \\"do pennance\\" rather than the faithful to the greek translation of \\"repent\\". The historical synopsis in the back of the book on the history in America of the teaching on Repentance was an eye-opener for me, and alone justified the cost of the book.For anyone wanting a biblical view of repentance, and the occasional precious jewel of knowledge thrown in as well, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop, If you need this book for a class","review":"This is the longest shipping time I have ever seen for a textbook. It says 2 to 3 weeks in the fine print. When I read it, I guess my eyes and brain corrected the ridiculous time frame and I thought it said 2 to 3 days. Now I won't have my book in time for class. My advice is read the fine print on this before you purchase. Barnes and Nobel is selling it for only a couple of dollars more, but you get it in a week, not two months."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest book ever written","review":"I fell in love with \\"The Master and Margarita\\" when I was seventeen. OK, one easily falls in love at this age. Yet so many years have passed and the novelty and magic of Bulgakov's masterpiece have never worn off even though I can recite whole passages by heart. I envy those who have not read this book yet. Za mnoi chitatel'! You won't be disappointed. About once a year I take a 24-hour break from the \\"real world\\" and immerse myself in the world of Yeshua and Woland and the glorious broom-riding Margarita."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'm not afraid because I've already been through everything.\\"","review":"Only a writer as skilled as Bulgakov could pull off a story that interweaves the crucifixion of Jesus into a Faustian tale featuring the devil. But The Master and Margarita is so much more than the typical good versus evil novel. It's also an eye-opening social and political commentary, one that's so scathingly obvious that it didn't see the light of day until forty years after Bulgakov's death. The deep themes and hidden undertones are everywhere, but you don't need a Ph.D. in literature or a Master's degree in Russian history to enjoy this book. Although a little slow-going at first, the action quickly picks up in part two and the chapters leading up to Satan's ball will have you breathlessly ripping through the pages. The dark and bitter cold Moscow provides a fitting backdrop for this well-deserving classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book - the best for all times!","review":"As far as I know, this book has the most percentage of readers in Former Soviet Union among all. I haven't seen a person in St.Petersburg (my birth town) who haven't read it. And everyone says this book had the greatest impact on their lives. Excellent work! A true masterpiece. Recommended for all."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in the translation","review":"I wanted to add my own review, not so much that I could add more than some of the very good reviews already written, but there is one that is misleading. It refers to Volokhonsky/Pevear's translation of The Master and Margarita. Just so you understand that This paperback is translated by Diana Burgin and Katherine Tiernan O'Connor.I'll accept the review on the other, as I haven't read it, but this version absolutely is amazing. When that reviewer said \\"preserve the easily flowing bubbling like champagne Bulgakov's speech\\", it struck me that that is precisely how this version came across. Bubbling like champagne. Hints of flavor and smell with each pop and fizz, it read easily, consumed with delight. The only way it could be better is if I spoke Russian and could read the original. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satan & his friends visit Moscow.......","review":"Great classic novel. I wasn't 100% sure that I would like or enjoy reading this at all, I was wrong~Getting used to all the \\"three-barreled Russian names\\" as other reviewers have stated, is probably the trickiest part of this classic novel! The author calls characters by their 1st name, then later refers to the same character by his middle and last name, a little confusing at times!This book has two parts, Part 1 is 168 pages, Part 2 is around 140 pages. Part 1 for me was a little boring, with the exception of the chapter \\"Black Magic and Its Exposure\\".Part 2 is where the book really picks up and turns into a real page turner! \\"Satan's Great Ball\\" is arguably the best chapter in the book!This book has several really, really memorable characters-Satan, called Woland in the bookBehemoth a mischievous, gun-happy, fast-talking, chess playing, black cat the size of a hog (a very likeable cat and the best character in the book by far)A great classic novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars for translation, not the book","review":"I admire this book and always wondered how it might have been translated into English. I reviewed several editions and versions, and found this one is a bit harsh in translation style, and not quite exact. I would recommend the edition from Penguin Classics, translation done by Richard Pevear; or the edition translated by Mirra Ginsburg."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Russian speaking reader","review":"The translation is lousy. The one made by Michael Glenny is far better, though his is sometimes very free - for example he may write \\"heart attack\\" instead of lungs sarcoma, and he calls Solovki an asylum while it's a prison, he also may omit passages (not very important ones, though) but his translation beautifully conveys Bulgakov's humour and that's the most important part. The translation we are discussing here does not do this and the book sounds dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest novels of the XXth century!","review":"My only wish is that more non-Russian speakers knew about it! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing else like it.","review":"What else can I add to the hundreds of 5 star ratings ? I only wish I was a master of the Russian language as to not miss what little rythym, timing, and less so meaning that could have been lost in translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Great Russian Literature","review":"Being a huge fan of Russian Writers, my opinion is biased. But, my peer who hates russian writers vehemently, took a chance on Mr. Bulgakov and was quite entertained and chose to exempt this writer from his fury. This translation is an easy read, like Chekhov, and absolutely hilarious in it's absurdity. Though religion is a strong theme in this book, it's not overpowering and he explains what some may not know so the reader doesn't get lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"The book arrived on time and I'm delighted to have bought it . Just started reading it and am enjoying it no end !"},{"rating":"2","title":"20th century masterpiece","review":"The Master and Margarita is truly one of the great novels of the 20th century. Hilarious, lyrical, insightful, and profound; Bulgakov's masterpiece will make you think, make you feel, and make you challenge yourself and your beliefs on good and evil. I'll mention that this review refers to the Burgin/O'Connor translation. I've read this translation twice, and I love it. I can't compare it to other translations though, as I haven't read any. I plan on reading the Pevear/Volokhonsky translation soon; I've read several translations by them, and all have been wonderful. One caveat about the Burgin/O'Connor edition: the endnotes, written by Bulgakov's biographer Ellendea Proffer, offer far too much opinion. She should not be telling us how to think, and how to feel about this novel. But that doesn't spoil this awe-inspiring novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading","review":"I really had no idea what to expect from this book before I started it. I read the back and was immediately attracted to the Bizarre plot. It became my favourite book after the first chapter. For a week I existed to read this book. School, food and friends were just obstacles in the way of my reading this book. It just became greater and greater as it went on. Bulgukav describes settings and characters so well (and in so few words) you feel as if you are there. This book also carries the widest selection of odd and creepy characters in one novel. most of all this book led me to ask the question, how come all books can't be this good?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second Rate","review":"This highly acclaimed novel doesn't deserve its reputation. As Russian literature in translation it is vastly inferior to Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and even Solzhenitsyn. As magic realism, it lacks the imaginative genius of Borges. As satire on the Communist regime, it pales before Orwell. In depiction of life under Communism, Koestler and Solzhenitsyn surpass it in detail and impact. As fantasy, the plot devices are banal and have been utilized to better effect by many other writers. The translation is sluggish and plodding where it tries to be poetic. The characters are annoying and lack depth. Two stars for a fairly intriguing take on Christ's trial and execution (about 60 pages in the 402 page edition I read)."},{"rating":"1","title":"blood and guts","review":"About midway through this book, I decided it could easily be turned into a screenplay for another run-of-the-mill slasher movie. Maybe the best is yet to come, but I resent having read so far waiting for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know, I know","review":"There are 245 reviews of this book and 206 are five star and only 5 are one star. But I will say that this book, tho it is written (or translated) so that it is easy to read, yet, tho I tried to penetrate at least one of \\"many tiers\\" of significance which it is said to have, I could not find any significance of interest to me. If one is into fantasy I suppose one could get caught up in the senseless and impossible things which occur all thru the book, but it all seemed dull and stupid to me. I have looked at the impressive web sites dealing with the book and obviously some are quite taken by the book. I was so glad when I reached the last page!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No principles for life in here","review":"I understand that this book is considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. Ok - but I don't see it. It is wild with imagination, and pretty funny, but there is nothing 'great' about it. There are no principles here to improve the life of the reader. There is nothing here I can take away - not even a better comprehension of human nature. I'm not qualified to talk about the translation, but I don't think my complains are with the actual wording, but with the overall theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nearly incomprehensible: this was hard work, not fun to read","review":"The devil and a bunch of his companions land in 1930's Stalinist Moscow and wreck havoc on the officially atheist city. What follows is an, in my opinion, incomprehensible tangle of out-of-the-ordinary events, not made any easier to comprehend due to the impression that one half of the male characters in the book seems to be called Nikolai Ivanovitsch and the other half Ivan Nikolaievitsch. There are probably a lot of very witty references to biblical events, but most of these will have escaped my atheist attention. In short: this was no fun to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book I've Ever Read","review":"Pretentious and boring, too clever for its own good, the only good chapters in this book are the ones about Pontius Pilate and Jesus Christ, and there's not enough of that.And this was the Michael Glenny translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy this much...","review":"I found that Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita failed to live up to hype, mostly because of the writing style and the dated content. The story is written in classic Russian style: confusing points of reference, an abundance of minutia and too many characters. I could never get into and wondered at the point of it all. It might have been entertaining in a phantasmagorical sort of way in the mid 20th century, but turns out to be slow and tame by today's standards. Despite numerous attempts, I've never been able to get into Russian literature; something to consider about the reviewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the great books of Russian literature","review":"So this book is not for those who read fairy tales or girly stories. It is an extraordinary story which I recommend to read. The price is good for this kind of book. I bought one and it was brand new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read for those who dig Russian novelists...","review":"Its a classic...what can I possibly say that hasn't already been said before? It would be REALLY cool if Roman Polanski or Woody Allen would direct a movie based on this book. I think it has a very pertinent message to post-modern America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, and enjoyable","review":"I was looking for Russian literature and had never heard of this, but read it on the advice of a Russian friend of mine. I loved it. It's definitely a bit quirky, but I just enjoyed it all the way through. I later read some of the literary criticism and realized how many deeper levels there were to it, but honestly, I just enjoyed it the first time as a story, a very unusual story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dread and great laughs","review":"Bulgakov died in 1940, this book was rediscovered in 1966. There are so many things to be said about this work and there are lots of different levels to explore. It's a fantastic bizarre story where nothing is impossible, for example a cat smokes cigar and knows how to use a gun. The restrictive cultural climate in USSR by this time is also something Bulagov critizes. It's a fascinating piece of work, with a great sense of humour that is absurd. The fictional land Bulgakov has painted is incredibly colorful. The book begins with a mystical stranger who enters Moskow and soon dreadful things starts to happen, still that doesn't stop the story from being very funny. This is a timeless novel that I think will survive through the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"i side with those who have called this tedious.","review":"this book has been hanging out at my house for about 20 years now, and i finally decided it was time for it to earn its keep. well, i'm now giving it the boot. off to the goodwill with the thing. this is suppose to be a masterpiece of scottish literature. ?. c'mon, you scots can do better than this! i know you can. this book is so weighed down with obscure & tedious scottish vernacular that i simply could not finish it. i made it to about page 100, then said, \\"i'm outta here.\\" if you are one of the folks who love this book, well: God love you. this book just was not my cup of tea, and i'm sure legions of others will feel the same way. the unsuspecting should be better forwarned about what lays between the covers of this book. that's my aim here. job done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes Please...","review":"This is a great indie film.

Some of Alfred's camera work, perhaps, the sort that has become a cliche in serial killer flicks. This script, however, has far less subtlety than \\"Seven\\" and few surprises. Moreau is always appealing in some way, but she is so businesslike in this role that the apparent fascination that her victims show for her is not credible even as comic parody of predatory men. Two of the revenge killings had promising storylines. One of these worked well. In the second she was an artist's model in a character that parodied the men, but the parody wasn't highlighted, the episode missed opportunities for added interest and thus seemed too long for nothing.

After all, the movie is supposed to be a homage to the creator of Psycho, Vertigo and Rear Window. Instead, all we got is some style and a plot with less suspense than the average scooby-doo episode. It has a lot in common with B-movies such as the Theatre of Blood (1973 - Vincent Price), where all you get to expect is a series of killings.

There was quite a bit of discussion on whether God exists, and the answers pro and con were so dumb that one wonders in the the producer, writer and director Tim Chey had ever actually read about this topic before he wrote the script.

They are forced to answer questions he asks, all of which are questions all humanity seeks answers for. It challenges all of us to not settle for mediocre lives, but to rise above, face and be the answer to the problems of our world, emphasizing love and forgiveness. The film's cast did an excellent job portraying people from all walks of life with whom any viewer could identify.

They have to earn so many points to stop the bomb.The first mistake was casting Stephen Baldwin as one of the geniuses.The second mistake was writing a script that has almost nothing to do with the plot.Even Tom Sizemore as the villain couldn't save this low-budget fiasco.So much promise with nowhere to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement","review":"i bought this for my sister as she had one and read it so much she completely wore it out.

I always want to know more about the characters, about what happens after the killer has been caught. Agatha Christie, in fewer pages, provides just as much detail about the characters but still manages to tie up all the story threads.The ending of Ashworth Hall, however, has an even more serious flaw (no spoiler here): it is not at all clear who the murderer(s) is/are.

It almost feels like you are listening to a play being acted out, as each character is given his own \\"voice\\", be it a man or a woman, and the different accents and dialects add to this feeling. The reading is given much feeling and emotion. Mr. Rickman even gets the chance to sing a little, in both English and French, what a treat to the Alan Rickman fan! I can't tell you what a treat is has been to settle in after a long hard day, slipping on the headphones, and laying down before sleep in the darkness with Alan Rickman speaking softly and close in my ears.... Ahhh... such SWEET dreams!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel I have read since Madame Bovary.....","review":"I absolutely devoured this novel! I love depressing books, so this one was definitely for me. Eustacia reminded me of myself sometimes. I loved this novel so much that I even bought the made-for-tv movie! I cried. And if you really liked this book, then you should try Madame Bovary by Gustave Flaubert. Eustacia reminded me so much of Emma Bovary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Day Soap Opera","review":"The Return of a Native, a fabolously written novel by the late Thomas Hardy, is a tale of forbidden love between Eustacia and Wildeve. Although the rather long descriptions of the heath tended to drag, the story in itself is tragic. In the beginning Eustacia and Wildeve were secretly seeing each other, until Wildeve marries Thomasin. Eustacia, desperately seeking a better life, marries Clym. This is the true beginning of the story. Hardy was ahead of his time writing this novel with the traditional twists of a modern soap opera. A tale of forbidden love, constant longing for better things, and mere gossip makes this story quite a read!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Listening Pleasure","review":"I bought this audiobook because it's narrated by Alan Rickman, my favorite actor. I knew nothing about the Thomas Hardy book before I bought this, but I'm fully engaged in this story of complicated love and longing thanks to Mr. Rickman's reading. His gorgeous voice and subtle performances (even when he voices female characters, he doesn't go over the top in an effort to sound like a feminine caricature) enliven the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rickman makes this novel go down easy","review":"I can't believe I listened to an entire Thomas Hardy novel - but I did and I loved it. I know I never would have made it through the book itself if it hadn't been for Rickman's wonderful reading. I was hooked after the first tape. I wonder why I haven't seen any other novels on tape read by Alan Rickman. I do think he should do more of this - I'd listen to more books on tape. Maybe even another Thomas Hardy novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic worth listening to","review":"This is the third time I've listened to this audio book, something I have never done before. I must admit, it gets better ever time. The description of the characters is incredible - when have you read a whole chapter describing an individual? Or the landscape? Certainly way more verbose than modern style, but the observations stand the test of time, and paint pictures that linger. None of the characters is flawless, and the errors of omission in their acts toward each other results in no end of misery. But the view of life in another time, with all its physical differences and all its emotional similarities to ours is intrigueing. And Rickman is fabulous, capturing accents and personalities that reading myself in my cozy chair in Phoenix Arizona would never have known."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return of the Native audio book","review":"As a keen fan of Thomas Hardy, I have found this reading wonderful. Alan Rickman's rendition is beautifully paced and the characters were really brought to life by the variety of tone within his voice. Certainly, this is one of Hardy's gloomier works--but all the more fascinating for the picture given of characters in a truly remarkable landscape. I've always regarded Egdon Heath as the true hero of this work anyway. At a time when I have needed distraction from my own circumstances, this marvellous version has proved invaluable and I look forward to acquiring others to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rickman's inspired reading brings this book to life","review":"I don't know how many times I've given up on Hardy novels - I pick them up with the best of intentions, but his language is just too ponderous for my taste. His works are undeniably masterpieces, but one must work agonizingly hard to pry the story out of the book. However, under Mr. Rickman's masterful interpretation, Egdon heath and its tragic inhabitants leapt from the book (or, as it were, the car speakers) and into my imagination, and I found myself eagerly anticipating my next road trip. I'll leave it to the other reviewers to describe the book itself, and say only that Mr. Rickman's rich voice makes Hardy's words not only tolerable but a mesmerizing (no pun intended, Rickmaniacs) sensual feast. If you're a Hardy fan or a Rickmaniac, this collection of tapes is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzz","review":"This is defintly not my idea of a page-turning book and I hope it isn't your either.

Good luck to you all and may god be with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Alan Rickman!","review":"Imagine my disappointment when, after reading all of the reviews about Alan Rickman's great reading style, I get this audio book in the mail only to find that it's actually read by Peter Jeffrey.

Native, has some interesting events and characters, but the setting description is too verbose. While the main characters are together, Hardy neglects all \\"love\\" human emotions. Eustacia loves Paris, no man. Hardy does not focus on the inner, only the outer side of life.

However, if you can handle the Heath peoples' odd speech, an exotic word choice, and long, drawn out descriptions of EVERYTHING, this book's for you!

All of the deep anguish and philosophical statements Haneke may have been trying to convey were too vague, buried too deep in the long shots across foggy fields and depressed faces of traumatized people. The lack of dialogue didn't help the viewer understand what is going on.

I have played numerous shows on and off-Broadway, and I have no words to explain the sounds this recording captured. First of all the music is trite. The composer doesn't have an original idea in him. The singers were ok, except for a few that weren't even in time with the orchestra. The conductor is also billed as a mixer, and I must say that I hope he hasn't quit his day job. Everything about this recording is sloppy. How can someone market such a disaster?Do yourself and my collegues a favor: use your money to promote good theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pretty flimsy book","review":"Yes, it does provide a new model for black reparations. However, the book thinks it is smarter than it is. The author makes an extremely weak case for even having black reparations in the first place. The case is essentially that Germany did it, so we should too. It ignores several key points, such as who will actually be hurt by the reparations (non-blacks) and the issue of fighting injustice with injustice. He wants repartions for slavery, but the victims and perpitrators are long dead. If you are looking to be convinced that there should be reparations, this certainly is not the book. If you are ready to jump to the conclusion that we need them (I certainly am not) then I guess this could be a possible way to go at it. Check out the Penn and Teller season 4 episode on reparations."},{"rating":"2","title":"bill nelson - getting the holy ghost across","review":"this was my most highly sought after cd that exists. had the recordings for years but never like this. very rare. quite pricey but oh so rare and holy. like the \\"holy grail\\" of cd's from mr. nelson. this was the era when his falsetto was king."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS CRAP!","review":"Okay, i like BT.

Even though Oneida had an on-line sale at the time, they said that I had to buy it at the regular retail price. In addition to paying the price difference of the patterns, I also had to pay currency exchange and sales tax.In Jan 2012, my husband noticed that on one of the knives, the blade moves when holding the knife by the handle. Two weeks ago, I discovered a black blemish on one of the knives and set it aside. I am definitely now happy about this.

The movie starts in the real world then does a rather quick shift to a sci-fi futuristic world. In a scene set in 1975, a cop-father tells his daughter, who later becomes the Scorpion, a story about a scorpion riding on a frog across a stream. Joan Severance's acting is a little weak in the beginning of the movie but improves as she dons a costume and becomes the Black Scorpion. One of the highlights is when a disrobed Joan rides her cop-partner to ecstasy, masked as the Scorpion. Hence the Scorpion takes the frog for a ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Scorpion Can Sting Me Any Time!","review":"If you love B-movies, comic books, or women dressed in bondage gear who fight crime this is your lucky day!You'll love this one!

Sayers seems to be able to think like a man as well as a woman.Remember that Sayers wrote in a different time and so her settings are really authentic.

It's almost as if the author got tired after 448 pages and just wanted to finish the story ASAP. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I'll leave it at that except to reassure that the mystery itself is solved; it's the *resolution* that's lacking.I've been reading the Lord Peter Wimsey stories in chronological order (and would rate nearly all of them so far as 4+ Stars).

When the movie ended, I was left gaping at the screen in confusion. I think that any Alan Rickman fan should definitely try it because he definitely offers a strong performance, but be warned about the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Alan Rickman's best","review":"More than many films, Dark Harbor bears repeated viewing -- it's after you know the ending that you can more fully appreciate the brilliance of Alan Rickman's multilayered performance, the apotheosis of his trademark blend of camp and subtlety. There's much else to recommend this intelligent and well-made film, of course, including very strong performances from the other two principal actors. Allegiances shift, clues to an unconventional mystery are scattered about like chips in a high-stakes poker game, and it is only in the final scenes that we see the cards the players are holding, and the chips stacked neatly on the table.The DVD edition includes a director's commentary that enhances the film's nuances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explain the phenomenon!","review":"Maybe it's just me, but I really don't see the appeal of this movie. It's an incredibly small production (3 actors comprise nearly the entire film), with very low production values. Norman Reedus gives by far the weakest performance as the hitchhiker, but Alan Rickman and Polly Walker are not at their finest, either. (And I am an Alan Rickman fan just like anyone else who would even consider watching this movie.) If you are an Alan Rickman fan, chances are you've already seen your fair share of horrible and incomprehensible movies that leave you wondering why an accomplished actor would choose them. And Dark Harbor is just one more of these. Don't let the promise of a \\"nude scene\\" convince you to buy this movie - honestly, Alan Rickman is better appreciated with his clothes on. As far as the movie is concerned, the plot is unoriginal and not particularly engaging. It is a very dialogue-heavy film and the dialogue is not well-written enough to carry it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the Ocean","review":"Alan Rickman does a fine job of being a perfect jerk of a husband, but outside of his great performance, the movie lacks interest. The movie could have had potential, but seems cut-up and fragmented in parts that just don't make sense or play well with the story line. Those who think they are great at guessing the end of a movie before it's over will have a challenge and a surprise here. If I had viewed this before purchase, it would never had made it to my personal library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twist and turn","review":"This movie has many twists and turns in it so watch the movie until the very end.

It isn't; it is set in Maine, though you would never guess from Polly Walker's very British accent. Old money Bostonians certainly don't sound that British. Many reviewers have talked about Rickman's unconvincing accent, but at least he attempted an accent. Miss Walker should have tried as well.Accents aside, this film is just dreadfully boring. It is very nearly the first act of Deathtrap with all the wit and style drained away.I admit I only watched it to see Alan Rickman. If that is your objective, go for it.

My complaint is similar to others: it wasn't long enough. I also feel like the script could have used a little more polish.

After all, Blockbuster doesn't have it.BUT, don't look at the box or talk with people about it before watching it. Remember, it's only 9-minutes long.

I'm not a die-hard star wars fan, I'm more of the \\"big-fan-but-wouldn't-dress-up-as-a-SW-character\\" type.Secondly, I wouldn't actually call this a movie. It's more of a string of scenes, each containing one or more rather lame Star Wars \\"innuendos\\". After it finished (all nine minutes of it), it left me asking : \\"So the point of that was what, exactly ?\\".The sheer cheesiness of it all is extremely off-putting and kills any entertainment value it might otherwise have had quicker than a lightsaber through the heart. Forget the cheesiness of \\"Scary Movie\\"- that was forgivable because it was genuinely funny; this isn't even slightly so.There is just one thing I can say about this collection to it's credit : It avoided the \\"I am your father\\", \\"Nooooo !\\" cliche (but only just).

It's basically one very simple joke told repeatedly.

I read the reviews here before seeing it, and I couldn't help noticing that those who are hardest on it never mention Shakespeare in Love and use many variations on the \\"one-note wonder\\" theme. In the context of everything it parodies, Lucas in Love is brilliant. As someone else pointed out, the juxtaposition of Shakespeare and Star Wars is an important part of the humor.

Even though this is an easy task for such a short, it is captivating beyond the first viewing. The story of the directors, Nussbaum and Levy, reminds me of Daltas and Westfall, who made \\"Steven Spielberg's Movie\\" after hailing from the same office in USC as the \\"Lucas\\" minds. I have to admire Nussbaum and Levy's short for its spin on the Star Wars Classics. What a great idea. Not only is Star Wars a legend we all know, but there are many a fan who go nuts over anything Star Wars. When you mix that with a quality short film, you just watch the money flow. If you liked this, you should check out Steven Spielberg's Movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most entertaining short that I've seen in a long time!","review":"Wow! During the 9 minute span of this short film, these folks were able to throw in every Star Wars/Lucas joke possible (even the low-blow \\"Howard the Duck\\" joke before the credits). \\"George Lucas In Love\\" is some wildly funny and entertaining stuff! The character swaps keep the humor moving, yet the nice production gives the film a professional gloss.For people who are still uncertain about plucking down some cash for a 9 minute DVD, the extra shorts appearing on the film are fairly entertaining as well! \\"Evil Hill\\" and \\"Swingers\\" are slightly less affective than the feature, but very funny nonetheless. \\"Film Club\\" was just. . . silly!

All the Star Wars fans who dissed this film for making \\"hackneyed Star Wars references\\" for no reason at all do not realize that the references are not STAR WARS references, they are references to SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE. It doesn't surprise me at all that a healthy chunk of Star Wars fans haven't seen or even know what SHAKESPEARE is about. I guess if a movie doesn't have action figures made from it or can't be found at one of those insipid sci-fi conventions, then it must not be worth watching, huh?

The remainder of the disc is from a manuscript that has been forgotten for 250 years, first performance just before this recording. The music is not typical of early 18th century Italian being shy and reserved, in my opinion palid and lifeless, no doubt why it has lain ignored for so long.But a review should be mostly about the performance, which is excellent, but as it was probably Marcon's choice of music I can mark it down.

The writing was simplistic and lacking in depth. Many people consider Hemingway's writing style simplistic, but there was depth of meaning beneath his unadorned manner of writing. Oprah has performed a valuable service for the public by encouraging reading through her book club. However, this book is like a good TV show. It may be 'good', but in the end it's still only TV. Also, I have a problem with the accuracy of the author's depiction of turn of the century Appalachia. He displays some knowledge of the area (poke is a local term for sack or bag), but I felt overall many details were suspect and lacking in complete credibility. For readers seeking a touching and more accurate picture of the time and locale, I suggest THE EDUCATION OF LITTLE TREE by Forrest Carter. His account is true and the writing is exceptional, in a sublime way. It was a 1991 Abby Award recipient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Flop","review":"It was a genuine disappointment, from the subtitle \\"the story of a marriage\\" you expect to read about all that comes with the package of sacrifice, hardship and victory, but it has nothing much to offer than any youngster already knows.

Its very easy to follow a conversation between 2 people and to constantly add that type of phrase after each spoken sentence drove me nuts.

Then, there's the filthy house she has to keep for Mr. Pendergast, the grease fire in the kitchen, and the flood which almost claims her and her husband Hank. THEN, there's Hank, fooling around with her no-good younger sister Caroline! Not to mention a high critical mother-in-law who has to have the last word and is deluded that she is behaving in a \\"Christian\\" manner! To top it off, there's starvation and a husband who can't/won't get a job! The subtitle says it's the story of a marriage. Oh dear! The convent is looking better and better!

Julie and Hank touched my soul in their efforts simply to eat, stay sane, and to love. The story is simply told, without flowery language and with a definite let's-not-play-with-the-reader attitude. Julie and Hank's story is so powerful it can stand alone as an inspiring glimpse into a world where, without labor and faith, you die. I can't wait to read the rest of Robert Morgan's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Kind of ... Dull","review":"Like many others here, I read this because it was an \\"Oprah book.\\" I'll give the author credit for detailed descriptions of what the characters had to do to survive ... killing hogs, giving birth unassisted, tending burns and laying out the dead, etc. ... but this book is strongly lacking in any emotional connection to its characters. Not to sound like an acting coach, but \\"where is the motivation?\\" If Morgan's intent was to show Julie to be a simple, hard-working, salt-of-the-earth young woman, he succeeded (for me) in portraying only the \\"simple\\" part of that equation. She was nothing more than an automaton, getting through each day by moving from one chore to the next. Where was her heart through all this, where was her soul? Vivid descriptions, one-dimensional characters, weak dialogue. I can only give this book 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and depressing","review":"I agree with another reviewer that there really wasn't a story in this novel. I appreciated (can't say I enjoyed them) the depictions of mountain life at the turn of the century and there were some passages that I thought were well written, but the plot went nowhere. When I got over half way through the book and realized that nothing had really happened to the characters (and wasn't going to, based on the remaining number of pages in the book), I just skimmed the last few chapters and called it a day. There is no story, no real growth (unless you count Hank learning not to lose his temper character growth), and no emotional payback for the litany of calamities that happen to Julie. I don't see the point of this book - and I really don't see how it ended up on Oprah's booklist. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst 'Oprah' pick yet","review":"This novel describes a series of events in the life of a turn-of-the-century woman, but does so very disjointedly and without purpose.

Eventually they became irritating and I had to finish listening to it in small bits over a few days.The problem was compounded by the reader's same monotone reading of the \\"I/he/she said\\" words. They were almost detached from the rest of the words. I also had a little trouble relating to or believing Julie's description of her feelings, etc. I think the problem might be a male author trying to write from a female perspective.

In my opinion, most of Oprah's recent picks have been misses. But this one grabbed me right off and kept me reading. No, it is not a wonderful, happy story. Rural life at the turn of the 20th century rarely was. But Julie was to be admired. She was strong, determined and honest. Hank was a spoiled, but charming little boy at the beginning of the book, but grew into a loving man at the end. It was a pleasure to read about their first year of marriage - how they went from being a \\"he\\" and a \\"she\\" to being an \\"US.\\" Mr. Morgan, will we have the pleasure of looking in on Julie and Hank's marriage again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasing to my heart","review":"Gap Creek is the second book I have read by Robert Morgan and I although it isn't my usual style of \\"pleasure reading\\" I absolutly enjoyed it. I am a wife and mother myself, and my reading time is just before bed when no one is tugging at me, and during my day I would find my self waiting impatiently for bed time so I could travel back to Gap Creek and visit with Julie and Hank... This book is one of the best. The reader is going through the same emotions as the characters with every turn of the page. I not only felt, but Mr Morgan, with his unique style, allowed me to see this story play out so vividly. I laughed at the town drunk, I hated Ma Richards along with Julie, and mourned the losses and truimphed the gains. Gap Creek is an experience, you will not soon forget. It is such a beautiful true to life story without sugar coating, but mostly it is a triumph about doing what is right.. Gap Creek is pleasing to the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have come to look forward to Oprah's book choices every month - she has introduced me to so many talented new novelists. However, Gap Creek is not one of her better choices. While the main character, Julie, and particularly her deep faith and the comfort she finds in hard work, seems very real, none of the other characters are at all developed. Particularly empty is Julie's husband Hank, and the relationship between the two of them - I was looking forward to seeing this fleshed out, after all, the book is subtitled \\"Story of a Marriage\\" - but the interactions between husband and wife were very stiff and unengaging. At times the details about food, cleaning, etc.-- while enormously interesting -- threaten to overwhelm the plot structure. I think that Morgan did an enormous amount of fascinating research, but that he did not quite manage to write the book he had hoped to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Of all the great books for Oprah to select, why this one? To discuss a book in the setting of a bookclub there must be something to discuss. In this book there is virtually nothing to discuss. I read this book in about three hours. My nine year old perhaps would have enjoyed it more than I did as it is about at her reading level. Most of Oprah's picks I find to be on the depressing side but after reading \\"Gap Creek\\" I felt nothing but anger that I had wasted my money on the book. I knew no more of impoverished lives in turn of the century Appalachia when I finished the book as I did when I began. Truly one of her worst picks to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad story","review":"I just recently finished reading Gap Creek, and though it was an easy read, I never actually liked the story. I could easily tell that it was a man writing Julie's feeling and thoughts. I never found her to be real. Her senses, especially smell, were well described. When it came to descriptions of her feeling I feel they were superfical and minimal. Falling in love is something girls, especially 17 year old girls, spend all day thinking about, but Julie's feelings were never really shared with us. Her life was difficult and she is a hard worker - that is brought out over and over again - though we all knew that from the first page. I wish Morgan spend more time inside her head and her feelings and less time saying the same things over again. At the end of the story I still did not really like Julie or Hank or their marriage. I will not be reading any more of Morgan's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking, intensely compelling...","review":"and it definetly left this reader wanting to know more of Julie and Hank's gritty, realistic life in the Carolina mountains at the turn of the 20th century. In fact, if there was ever a book perfect for a part two, this is it! Mr. Morgan has written a haunting novel that will stay with you long after you have put it down. It left me in awe of the strength it took to survive such poverty and disaster as befalls this young married couple. Sounds like a depressing book, huh? Yep. But there is so much to admire here that, amazingly, you don't go away feeling blue. I read a lot and this is one of the best. (And I would have added that last star if I could have had more). But wait! I guess that only proves this is a great book. Please, Mr. Morgan, write a sequel.

Depressing. That is really the only way to describe this book. This is not coming of age or life lesson learned type material. This is \\"there is no way this much crap could happen to one person\\" material. I will surmise the plot: woman...unlucky...woman..upset...unlucky, upset woman...end of book. Save yourself the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many descriptions","review":"The story was okay, but it kept getting slowed down by overly-detailed descriptions of the household tasks. For example, when Julie did the laundry it went on-and-on-and-on about gathering the clothes, fetching the water, boiling the water, shaving the soap, stirring the clothes, etc. Then the details of butchering the hog went on for pages. It was 100 years ago, so I didn't expect her to have Whirlpool appliances. But I was getting exhausted, having to do all of that housework with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of stark, raw daily survival","review":"Seventeen-year-old Julie Harmon is no stranger to hard manual labor, especially after the death of her father, leaving her the main support for her mother and sisters in their remote mountain home. So when Hank asks her to marry him, she thinks any life they build together will be easy by comparison.Within weeks, Julie learns just how much hardship the two will have to face in order to make it day to day. Deaths, natural disasters and mean-spirited opportunists combine in such formidable force that the young couple is almost beaten before they've started.In times like these, Julie and Hank often wonder what it's all worth...but with time, they learn just how much they do need and love one another, and the fledgling life together they're nourishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"AH Spare Me","review":"I really had to force myself to finish this book, was waiting for something good to happen to this couple. I was waiting for a portion of the story that didn't seem forced or too unbelievable to happen and it never did. Not worth the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gap Creek","review":"I have just finished Gap Creek and felt compelled to write a review. I read it because of Oprah selecting it and it had very good reviews. I read a lot of books and I can't for the life of me understand why this one was chosen by Oprah or why the reviews were so good! It didn't seem to have any real plot and all it talked about was hard work and food. I don't know what I missed. I like it when Oprah selects books that have the potential for a real discussion of ideas and opinions like Map of the World. I just finished reading The Pact by Jodi Picoult and thought it ws wonderful and had so much more to think about it. I would love to see Oprah select that or Barbara Kingsolver's Pigs in Heaven. Oh well, just my opinion. Will check back to see how others feel. Happy reading to all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bummed me out!","review":"If you're into books where nearly nothing good happens, this is the book for you. If you enjoyed Angela's Ashes, this is another book that will splendidly bring you down and depress you. Nothing happy or good happens to poor Julie, the main character in the book. The story is well-written in a simple, concise manner. While the writing is \\"neat,\\" the story is simply a downer. If you're looking for something to pick you up, don't pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gloomy, Gloomy, Gloomy!","review":"I did not find this book interesting at all. It is very depressing. The couple in the story go from one catastrophe to another. Would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice details, but boring plot","review":"The scenary and the feelings of each character were nicely descriptive,but the story was plain out boring. All the bad things that happened seemed to occur for such a dumb reason and left me exasperated. It also made marriage seem horrible and hopeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very negative","review":"The writer, Robert Morgan, was able to describe things in such a way that I knew exactly how things were done. For example, I now know precisely how a hog is butchered. But the book as a whole was very negative. This young couple met with one disaster after another. Julie was a hard working, seemingly intelligent woman. But she kept making mistakes which caused some disasterous outcomes. And her husband and mother in law were such losers, it was hard to take. I mean, didn't they have any redeeming qualities that lasted? I felt very sad after reading this book. I would not recommend it, except for the exceptionally descriptive writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable and gripping","review":"Coming from the South (coastline), in an area that deals with floods and hurricaines, I related quite well with some of the hardships that Gap Creek had to deal with. I read this book in 2 days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Descriptive but not enough","review":"While the author was able to describe the scenery and the actions going on, he was unable to describe the relationship between Julie and Hank. After Julie gave birth to their first child I wanted to know the emotions involved between the couple. After the death I also wanted to know the reactions from both sides towards each other. The author need to share the emotions of these two characters in order to grip my attention and make me think about the book long after putting it down. Oprah has made some wrong choices in books, but Gap Creek can not even compare to the emotions expressed in A Map of the World. I was expecting a similar book to Map of the World, feeling every emotion of the character, instead I was able to vision the scenery and work more than anything. I was very disappointed in this book. If you want a quick read without getting involved with the characters then you might enjoy the book, otherwise I would pick something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laura Ingalls meets Foxfire","review":"I admire Oprah for introducing the average TV watcher to the joy of a good book. However, this is only a so-so book. It is leagues ahead of the 'heaving bosom' genre, but it isn't great literature. The characters were thinly developed and the story line predictable. Laura Ingalls Wilder's Little House books are a better choice for descriptions of pioneering spirit. If you want to learn about hog butchering and hardtimes-read the Foxfire series. These are the true stories gathered from interviews with the residents of the NC/SC/GA border area."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is a novel about a very poor young couple living in the Carolina mountains after the Civil War and their hard, hard lives. The work of day to day living back then was mind-boggling! The characters go through many trials and tribulations - fire, flood, extreme poverty, deaths of loved ones. There are many fine descriptions: butchering a hog; how to live through and clean up after a flood; childbirth. This book reminded me of the book \\"Christy\\" and \\"Strangers in the Forest\\". Very realistic, very well written, amazing to us modern day folk. I only wish it had been longer, I hope there is a sequel featuring the young couple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting","review":"I enjoy historical fiction.

My father used to say that if you get your hand stuck in a bear trap, you should always appoligise to him for setting it off. My father always loved me, though I never knew the man. My moms told me he was killed in a war the day I was born, but I hink they killed him and burried him under the porch to quench their love. Oh man, I need a drink."},{"rating":"1","title":"ouch!","review":"This book can be summed up in one simple sentence: life is hard and then it gets harder. The author heaps so many bad things on the main character you start to guess exactly what is going to happen before it does. Despite all this calamity, however, the heoroine never seems to change or grow. The other people in the book are pretty much stock characters: the inattentive, incompetent doctor, the town drunk, the pinch-mouthed mother-in-law, etc. In addition, this is a familiar tale of hard scrabble existence and survival in the face of all. It has been told elsewhere and much better. Check out: MY DROWNING."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books ...","review":"GAP CREEK is a pretty disappointing novel. All plot and little development of character or setting.If you liked GAP CREEK or think you'd like to read a similar book, try FAIR AND TENDER LADIES by Lee Smith. The voice, character, setting, and plot are so much more alive than in GAP CREEK.I wish Oprah would \\"discover\\" Lee Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a rewarding read!","review":"I had expected a story relating the changes in a woman over a long period of marriage and her growth despite great hardships. It covered such a brief period, but oh! the hardships! The book was a litany of all the things that could possibly go wrong for a very young and naive woman living a terrible life, and ended with her no better off than when the story began. I couldn't reconcile them having fresh lemons to squeeze to treat the young brother in his illness during a winter with nothing but corn meal to eat for the next several months? All in all, a real downer of a story. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never ending story...","review":"Page after page of sadness and gloom to finally end up still in sadness and gloom... The story, little of it there is, is just a description of people going through life with such privation and hardship and just accepting it.

I would not recommend such a dreary and monotonous book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GAP CREEK: A NOVEL-Everyone should read it.","review":"As a native of NC and having spent many woderful vacations in the mountains, I have met Julia-at least her spirit. Robert Morgan has written a book of exceptional quality and truth about an exceptional woman in a time and place far removed from most peoples' lives. As he introduces her character and strength the reader at first feels pity, then amazement, but finally and most importantly, admiration as this woman deals with death, destruction and the loss of all earthly goods. But she still seems to come away stronger; in body and spirit. I read this book in one afternoon-found it impossible to put down. If there is a \\"list\\" above and beyond the New York Times \\"Best Seller List\\" this book should be at the top"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"I thouroughly enjoyed Gap Creek, and found it to be an interesting look at the first year of a married couple's life together during the turn of the century. For the most part the story kept me turning pages. Although, there were a few lengthy and tiresome descriptions of various farm chores and animal slaughtering, they reinforced the reality of our heroine's world. I also found the speech patterns to be slightly annoying, but easily tolerable when taken into consideration the time and location in which the story takes place. Julie was a wonderful heroine who teaches her reader about contentment, thankfulness, patience, and perserverance. Overall it was a delightful read that I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Taters! 'Taters! 'Taters!","review":"Just like so many readers, I went for one of Oprah's Picks! I didn't have to read this book to know that women are hard workers, have backbones, and can continue to carry the weight of the world on one's shoulders, even in the darkest of moments! If you like repetitive descriptions of \\"'taters, grits, and cornbread,\\" and undeveloped characters throughout the book, then you might enjoy this read. I kept reading just because I thought that eventually something might happen. Thank God, at least Mr. Morgan came through with Mr. Pendergast's Hidden money ! I don't think this will be one for the big movie screen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story doesn't seem to be ended...","review":"This book would be good for young people to read who have never thought about hard life once was for a man or woman or child. It probably accurately describes where items were stored and how food was kept during that period. Privies, which most young people have never experienced, are covered. Cooking, the danger of fires, hog-killing are discussed and beneficial. Some parts of the book, however, are useless, such as the implied sexual attraction between Hank and Carolyn. The relationship, if there was one, was never completed in the story and I read through to the end thinking something else had to happen. In summary, the book was somewhat interesting but didn't fully complete the story insofar as I was concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I stuck with it","review":"After I read the wrenching first chapter of this book, I was very tempted to put it down and not pick it back up. When I finally did, I was still hesitant because I thought that the characters would not endear themselves to me, but I was wrong. I did grow to care about them - all of them - even the \\"hard-to-like\\" characters. I found myself wishing that the story would continue when I came to the last page. Robert Morgan knows his subject matter thoroughly, and he writes with a great love of his native North Carolina and the surrounding territory and mountains. I definitely, definitely recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A heart warming story of hard life inearly 1900s","review":"This book has a shock at the start then a general slightly bland middle and the last half of the book is Fantastic! I stayed up until 4am and could not put it down until it was completed. I think it is a fabulous story of real people and true life experiences, I recommend it to adults not for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, blah, blah","review":"This has to be one the worst books I've ever read. Boring & incredibly tedious is an apt description. I actually ended up disliking both characters, she was pathetic & he was a bully. The only good thing is that I borrowed this book from a friend & didn't actually spend any hard cash for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was wonderful!","review":"I read \\"Gap Creek\\" over a month ago (...) This bookwas great! Julie learns a lot about being a wife really fast.She had to put up with WAY too much from her young husband. The pig slaugtering was a bit too graphic, but hey, that's life. Read this book and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I have read books that deal with human suffering and hardship--Les Miserables, or lately, The Heartsong of Charging Elk--and they inspire me. This one doesn't. In fact, it is tedious in its descriptions of one tragedy after another. What bothered me most is the heroine's inability to do more than work. Yes, hard work is commendable, but so is change, and her character though stoic, is static. She seems to be destined to a life on the level with some animals because her only outlet is to work and then work harder. I think good fiction should give us a glimpse of a better way to live and to respond to the suffering that is life. Julie has one response and never varies from it. Gap Creek has one note to play and pounds it from the first page to the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gap Creek","review":"The best book I have had the pleasure of reading in years!!!! Robert Morgans insight into life in the late 1800's, keeps you interested and afriad to put the book down!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I have been a Robert Morgan fan since reading his collection of short stories, but I put this book down before I was halfway through. Although spouse abuse might have been acceptable in those days, Morgan didn't make it acceptable in my mind. I just plain didn't like or care about Hank. Eventually I found Julie tiresome because she just seemed to take his slaps and name calling in stride, going to on to scrub out one Aegean stable after another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please....","review":"I bought the audio tape of this 'book' and I guess I'm glad I did, because if the book was anything like the tape - it was boring as hell! I would never have been able to finish reading the book unless I made a reservation at a sleep clinic! With all the books in all the world, if this is the best Oprah could do - ? I just tore up my membership card."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable Story","review":"The main character is a resilient woman who I will remember for a long time. The author's use of dialect made the story entertaining. The characters were real enough for you to experience genuine like or dislike of them. It got to be a bit long by the end, but it kept me involved, wanting to know what happened at the end. Worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I loved this book. I felt I was left hanging at the end as the story seemed to just stop. But I suppose since it was called Gap Creek and they left Gap Creek the story was over once they left. I think it could have had a better ending but all in all it was an excellent story of survival and love."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Creek Doesn't Rise","review":"This story of a young couple's hardscrabble married life in a valley on the NC-SC border could have fit neatly into a novella. While the direct, dramatic opening and follow-on introduction to the Harmons promises a colorful family saga, ad nauseum repetition and details of every mundane activity extended the story beyond interest. It seems like every scoop of grits and every pot of coffee was described. The best scenes are delivered upfront; so, by the middle of the book, nearly everything important has happened. While the major characters, Julie, the narrator and her husband, Hank, are rather flat, the writer's portrayal of them as immature and nave is realistic. The strongest moments features Ma Richards, the mother-in-law. When she leaves Gap Creek, she also leaves a huge space in the plotline. And, she doesn't return soon enough to save \`Gap Creek' from being a tortuously slow, morbid story with an unfulfilling ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE TO BE AN \\"OPRAH\\" PICK","review":"After finishing this book, my first thought was that this author must be best friends with Oprah for her to have picked it. When I see it on the bestseller's list, I have to laugh. It wasn't even that good....as a matter of fact, it was boring. I never read a book where the characters were so un-developed. You never find out what any one individual's motivation is for doing anything. In marrying Hank, Julie leaves one life of drudgery for another. Now I understand that this was the way life was back then but the author has the nerve to have the words, \\"The Story of a Marriage\\" right under the title of the book. If this was the story of a marriage, then Julie should have stayed single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gap Creek","review":"I loved this book I could not put it down, Julie and Hank touched my heart they struggle through loss of family and home but they hold strong the ending left me wanting more . I want to read more about Julie and Hank . But I loved the story so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you appreciate how easy you have it","review":"This book makes you appreciate all of the modern appliances and conviences we have here in the year 2001. I thought Gap Creek was a nice story about sticking together through good times and bad & about how hard work can help you feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal, depressing, unremittingly grim","review":"The book begins with a little boy dying as he vomits tapeworms that are still alive and wriggling, and gets grimmer from there. This is the single most depressing book I have ever read, because it's essentially hopeless without the redemption of educating or instructing the reader in any meaningful way. Robert Morgan can certainly write; I only hope that he writes more interesting books in the future. In the meantime, I suggest \\"Cold Mountain\\" as a book about hard mountain life, but with a soul as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helpless, Hopeless, and Clueless","review":"This is a depressing tale of a young woman who marries a virtual stranger and is mildly surprised that he turns out to be cold and mean. She works like a dog, doesn't complain, and accepts her miserable life without any insight or motivation to change.I would like to have seen some growth in the character of Julie, but there was none. All I can say to the subtitle of \\"A Story of a Marriage\\" is that I hope that few people are locked into relationships like this one.The book is replete with illness, death, brutality, and unkindness. All of these I could accept if the main character had shown some human qualities, but she just plods on in saintlike acceptance of her lot. UGH!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like sitting in my great-grandmother's kitchen","review":"More and more, I appreciate the hardships and endurance of my Appalachian ancestors. Reading this book made me yearn to hear my great-grandmother's voice again.It is the story of a marriage. Despite the beating Julie and Hank get from life, they emerge strong, more than two separate people, and ready to face a better life beyond Gap Creek.I've heard stories much like these from my grandparents and great-grandparents.

It is a fun journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time to read","review":"The highlight of the entire book was the birth of the child on the kitchen floor. Other than that, I found the book somewhat lifeless. I had no sense of the characters, they didn't jump off the pages at me like other books of the same genre have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"I checked out the audio version and could not get past CD 4. The constant \\"I said/he said...\\" drove me crazy. However, the worst thing about it was the unbelievably dreary story line and how unrealistically mature and introspective Julie was. Her character, for all she went through, was actually one-dimensional and predictable. All the book amounted to were detailed descriptions of country life and too many down home southern sayings. It was one trial after another with ridiculous \\"tough\\" insights by Julie. This was not realistic! Do not waste your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying audio","review":"I listen to a lot of audio books and this was the most annoying one I've ever listened to. Perhaps reading the book is much better, but since this is a review on the audio, I don't recommend it. The reader was exhausting and she said every single \\"said\\" the book had written. Example: \\"I don't know\\" Pappa said... \\"But I think so\\", I said. \\"You must go\\", Mamma said. \\"Why\\", I said... \\"because it's the best thing to do\\", Pappa said. In one paragraph she probably said about 8 \\"said's\\". I began to notice myself just concentrating on the \\"saids\\" and not the actual story of the book. Her inflictions, etc... UGG. After two CD's I couldn't bare to listen anymore. Sadly, the story was pretty decent, which is why I say to just bye the book and not the audio CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor knowledge of women (especially SEX)- slow writing","review":"A disappointing attempt to write about female sexuality in this book. I am sorry, but no 17 year old virgin has an orgasm on her first sexual encounter after walking for miles to a new place away from her family for the first time in her life with a man she knew for 2 weeks! How old are you? Geez Richard...I thought you would know that it's different for women! If you don't know, you should find out, especially if you choose to write in their perspective! I agree with the one reviewer who complained about Robert Morgan's style. It seemed to get worse in about the middle of the story. I skipped sentences to keep interested. The book does a good job showing how hard it was to live back then...lots of hard work! The language was very realistic...simple and Southern.

Although the book is well written and the author paints a very vivid picture (sometimes too vivid), too many horrible things happen to make the underlying message of hope ring true. You are constantly left wondering what catastrophe can possibly happen next. Similarly, you keep waiting for things to turn around and they don't. It's the type of book you'd have to read for an American Lit class, then write a profound paper on. Unfortunately, it's just not very profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo to Gap Creek","review":"I have read many books on the appalachain woman, this is poor. Julie should have knocked her husband up the side of his head with a spoon! He lied to her . He did nothing to help her and ran home to fetch his mother; who was the cause of all the trouble. No mother -in-law should force her pregnant daughter-in-law to butcher and lift large kettles of lard! This book is not worth the money paid to read it. The character development does NOT portray a true pioneer. It needs a rewrite to become a true depiction of mountain people. I suggest you read Follow the River / by Thom to know the hardships of the wilderness or the books by Allen Eckart instead. For a fun set of mountain people read anything by Jesse Stuart-now that's true mountain magic"},{"rating":"1","title":"How many bad things can happen to one person!","review":"This book was horrible.Every page was about what bad things happened to this girl and her family.Everyone treats her bad and every other day devastaion happens.It is not realistic.I just don't understand why you would want to read a book about a sad life.Books are suppose to make you think and feel.This just seemed like you were saying to yourself \\"I am going to throw this away of one more thing happens\\".Oprah really surprised me with this pick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAPPY!","review":"Come on folks, get a grip!

I know because I grew up there. Just like, Julie Harmon, I've milked cows, sawed firewood, and ate cornbread for breakfast. I can also identify with Robert as a writer. My novel, Edge of Heaven, puublished: November, 1997 by Bright Mountain Press in Asheville, N.C., is set in the same place and time period. I think it is hard for a man to write about a woman's feellings and still harder to tell a story in first person. This method prohibits the author from letting the reader know how the other characters, who are important to the story, are feeling and thinking. Given these handicaps, Morgan did a great job. If you would like to compare the two books take a look at, Edge of Heaven, at Amaazon.com.

This is the last Oprah recommendation I bit on. Oprah, you're loosing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"**AN ABSOLUTE TREASURE**EXCELLENT READ!","review":"Julie Harmon will become one of the great heroines in literary history. The story takes place in 1899 to 1900 in the mountains of North Carolina. With a father with lung disease, Julie and her sisters must work the land for the family to survive. Julie is unlike any other young woman of the times - she has a desire to meet and marry a nice young man. After witnessing the agonizing death of her brother and suffering the hardships of being the \\"man\\" and essentially the leader of the family, Julie finally marries, leaves her family and moves with her husband down the mountain to Gap Creek. The young couple face numerous obstacles, challenges and hardships during their first year of marriage. This is her story. A great read and I heartily recommend it. If you like this, you may want to try THE TRUEST PLEASURE and THE MOUNTAINS WONT REMEMBER US, also by Robert Morgan."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was like listening to my grandmother speak...","review":"My father's family hales from the mountains of Virginia, and I felt Gap Creek did a credible job of portraying the mountain life. That alone would have made the book interesting, but there was more. I found that the heroine, Julie, was someone I genuinely liked and admired. She was a real person who made real mistakes, but she also had a core of integrity that directed a lot of her decisions. It was refreshing to have the main character be someone I'd want to sit down and have a cup of coffee with. Actually, it was my affection for the heroine that leads me to only assign this review four stars. While I enjoyed the author's beautiful prose, I wanted more of Julie's thoughts and feelings to be described, since I found that to be the real strength of the story. So, the portrayal of everday life in the mountains was realistically harsh, but the characters, especially Julie, are worth getting to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!","review":"I would sincerely rate this book as one of the best that I have EVER read! Being from Appalachia myself, I related Julie's hardships to those that my great-grandparents had to endure on a daily basis.

This was surely true of the kind of life she led. This couple truly were tied to the earth and very close to the elements of nature and the calamities they can cause. For the sequel, I think the couple should move to Oklahoma and encounter a tornado and its consequences.

This book opens our minds to how easy our lives are comparitively. Things we take for granted, food, shelter, medical care, transportation, a paying job, were hard won back then. Julie's life made me realize how spoiled we have become. If everyone worked as hard as Julie, no one would go to bed hungry and everything would sparkle.

Against her mother's wishes, they decide to get married. Right afterward, they pack up the few belongings they have and move to Gap Creek because Hank found work in that area.

The entire novel is a progression of horribly unlucky events. Life is hard enough without bringing the trials and tribulations of this young woman's life into your own. In most novels where shadows are continually cast upon the lives of the characters a light appears at the end of the tunnel. In Gap Creek, I was pleading for the end of these poor people's lives as it appeared to be the only means for their escape from the hell on earth Mr. Morgan cast them in."},{"rating":"2","title":"GAP CREEK - A NOVEL","review":"I thought this was a good book.

I read it in three sittings, and skipped whole paragraphs just so I could finish the book. It did not get better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Sweet, Raw and So Very Real","review":"The marriage that Robert Morgan depicted in this novel was timeless. Times were certainly different 100 years ago, but people haven't changed much and some of the things that Julie and Hank went through in their time living on Gap Creek reminded me of the first couple of years of my own marriage. This is a must read for anyone wanting to escape the hustle and bustle of the 21st century for a week. You'll never forget Gap Creek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gap Creek","review":"Can't deny that this has a good story line, but can't understand how an editor could let a writer get away with the numerous \\"I said, he said, she said, Hank said\\" which continues throughout the story.

Will continue listening to the recording, but even my husband admits that the writing is terrible. Would appreciate other comments regarding this annoying repetition."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point??","review":"This book gets off to a good start. The writing is good, the characters start off interesting and it seems the plot is going somewhere. But as I got to about page 200 (or 2/3 through the book) I began to wonder what the author was trying to say. What's the point? That life is hard and you just have to get through? I read one other review that complained that the character of Julie never changed. I have to agree with that. There was no growth for her througout the book. There was no character development, at least for Julie who is supposed to be the protagonist. And when you don't see growth in the character, all the hardships that are thrown in - the fire, the flood, the death of a child - they all seem pointless. I have to admit though, some passages were a joy to read for the description and the words used alone. But that doesn't make a book. Others liked this book. It left me scratching my head."},{"rating":"1","title":"*yawn*","review":"I found this book incredibly boring. At no time are you really encouraged to care about any of these people, none of them are particularly interesting, and nothing really happens. It's the dreary, grey, spiritless story of dreary, grey, spiritless people. The heroine has a touch of spunk and strength to her, which is cancelled out by her choosing to be a doormat for everyone. I kept waiting for something dramatic or inspiring or, well, interesting to break out. Never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"considering the magnitude of Bryn Terfel as a star, it's almost a let down.

It is clear that some Moscow based teachers have a tight grip on \\"Denon\\" and that is how poor playing gets on Denon CD's... amazingly along with such a phenomenal pianist from Russia like Valery Afanassiev. It is a shame that the names of these two underdeveloped musicians and average piano students - Irina Mejoueva and Constantin Lifschitz - could be on the same label with a major musical exponent of our time - Valery Afanassiev. There is something for Denon A&R people to think about!

What a difference! Before, the units were mired in molasses; afterwards, they are very fast and wonderfully fluid. Don't expect to get any help from Toshiba, however.

The felt was stapled with very visible stapes. The core material of the table was cheap fiber board (not even MDF) so that's why screws do not stay on. All screws holding the pockets were loose.Pros: The only thing I liked about this product are the balls and slightly curved cue sticks.Bottom Line: Look elsewhere for better quality product.

Mel Gibson and Danny Glover are the partner- in -crime duo again, and this one sees Riggs and Murtaugh joined by Joe Pesci as Leo Getz, the exasperating cop who returns in parts 3 and 4. The action is as impressive as the former one, and director Richard Donner's hard- as-nails approach to the film makes it as exhilarating as it's predecessor.

The villians are still good and the violence and action are still exciting and also the hot chick that of course is drawn to Mullet Gibson at first sight is also hot and nude in one scene.

Not only can this ten year old manage to constantly foil a \\"professional,\\" but this hit man must have failed Hit Man School.

I laughed til I cried.It's difficult to tell whether this film was intentionally funny or just happened to turn out that way accidentally. The plot is delirious and the acting atrocious, but the city of Amsterdam has a great chance to shine and is perhaps the only star of this movie worthy of recognition.This film is worth seeing because of how incredibly bad it is. Like the accident you can't help staring at."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my hour and forty minutes back ! ! !","review":"I just wish there was a way to rate this one with negative stars. I've never rated anything, but cannot bear the thought of some other poor bored soul losing precious time with this stinker. I watch a lot of movies, and this may very well be the worst I've ever seen. To quote the person who watched it with me \\"Shame on William Hurt. Shame on Denis Leary and Jennifer Tilley. Shame on the kid who brought sandwiches to the set at lunch!\\"Apparently there were no Dutch in Amsterdam while filming this because everyone spoke with an American accent. Maybe the Dutch read the script first and knew better.If you want to spin a positive on this movie, then turn it into a drinking game. Every time Bill Hurt switches back and forth from a Southern drawl to his normal voice, take a shot of your favorite liquor.

However, the DVD will not play on her DVD player (which is only about 4 yrs old). It plays fine on her daughter's player (her's is a BluRay player). So, virtually, this purchase was a waste of my money, and a disappointment as a gift. It seems possible that a BluRay format DVD was put in the wrong case. TOO BAD...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have liked to have watched it","review":"When an utem is sold in America I would think it was so it could have been played in America.

I have given it as a gift on more than one occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I Want To Fly\\"","review":"'Mao's Last Dancer' is an overall enjoyable film about true events in the life of Chinese ballet dance Li Cunxin that in my estimation makes it more watchable then if it were fiction. The dancing scenes sre amazing, but I found the acting to be rather stiff and the relationships explored dull and unemotional. Being based on a true story the plot also suffers from the same malaise that all such actual accounts do, the ending is already known so the possibility of manufacturing any cinematic tension, or anticipation is difficult if not impossible.My favorite segments of the story where those based in China showing Li's early years of training and the brief glimpses of what life was like during the Mao regime. Definitely the best part of the film.My rating: -3 Stars- as far as entertainment value goes / -4 Stars- as a true story and associated social commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOURGEOISE CRAP","review":"A made-for-TV-piece (not literally, but like a TV movie afraid of scaring the horses) of conformist, bourgeoise foolishness, which might reinforce a right-winger's view of the world and its fear of China.I also expected better acting, and perhaps a Merchant-Ivory-quality production."},{"rating":"2","title":"True art","review":"My wife and I saw this last night. I had read it had great reviews and my wife was wishy washy before it started but was a total convert by the end. I normally don't watch ballet either but this movie gave one a real appreciating for it. A real appreciating for everything actually. Family, one's life, country, etc. I think one thing that should come out is that even though the Chinese communist goverment is awful and lies to its citizens - they at least allowed in the end for many things that a lot of other countries would not have. I am not going to spoil the story by getting into it, but the point is that some of the horrible things that were thought about the Chinese didn't turn out to be true.Anyway, I highly recommend this movie to any and all. As someone else put it, the ending was glorious. Couldn't agree with that sentiment more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"This was as great as I wanted it to be.

This movie didn't really show much of the hardship that Li went through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching film","review":"This film is a little bit on the long side, but it is well worth watching. The premise of the film is that a young Chinese dancer, who trained his whole life in China to become a top level ballet dancer comes to America, only to be overwhelmed by the amount of consumption. He stands firmly against this ideological mindset initially, but eventually grows to love America, and a dancer. He decides at the last minute to marry an American dancer.Due to this he and his family are essentially cut off from communication. I won't write what happens next, but let me tell you that there is a truly emotional part, which will cause eyes to moisten, be prepared.Wonderful concept, it's a movie for families, couples and children.

At age 11, Li - a rural peasant boy -- was chosen to train at Madam Mao's Beijing Dance Academy.Against impossible odds, the he went on to become world-renowned and arguably one of the all-time greatest classical ballet dancers. But it's the love story that tugs at the heart when Li falls in love with an American woman - yes, he's a heterosexual. But Li must risk it all to remain in the land of the free.Here's a great, soul-stirring story not only about grace on stage -- but also in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a beautiful and emotional story.","review":"This is truly an emotional and beautiful true story. A young Chinese boy is picked to become a part of a ballet academy in Beijing. Although he has great natural ability, he needs to overcome the obstacles and learn to be a truly great ballet dancer. Thanks to an open-minded teacher in the communist country, Li finds the strength, courage and passion for ballet he needs, that leads to him being chosen as an exchange student in America. Once in America, he wishes to stay and faces the obstacle of the Chinese government. Without wanting to give away any other details, I will say that I would definitely recommend this for anyone looking for an emotional movie and especially for those fans of the beauty that is ballet.A truly moving story. Perfect casting. Every actor fit their role so well, I would have thought I was truly watching the actual events unfold.The ending was absolutely fantastic.

This book centers around the murder of Unity Bellwood, a classic's scholar who is found dead after apparently being pushed down the staircase in her employer's home. Charlotte and her usually familiar partners in detection are notably absent. Instead the book concentrates on the boring lamentations of the suspects in the house.

And how does he have the right to group all average single males into this farce of a book? I am ashamed for him.

Of course, because it’s Tom Waits taking you there you are taking a trip into shattered dreams, self-destruction, alcoholism, and ultimately the cold, cold ground. The CD contains the song for a two-act play, so beyond the attraction of being one of his best recordings, it is also the most cohesive. Following Frank’s story from song to song is just as good a reason to buy the CD as the memorable tunes, brilliant lyrics, creative use of studio techniques, and diverse instrumentation. If I have one criticism, it is that Waits�?singing is sometimes too theatrical and melodramatic. It’s usually when he’s singing first person as Frank, but it helps to tell the story so it’s not out of place, per se. But “good�?acting is when the audience is not conscious of the process of acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's too; but I don't know if it makes sense to compare it to other Tom Waits, or any other album for that matter. While it -- and Waits -- owes much to many musical genre's, Frank's Wild Years is an original. Nothing I've ever listened to prepared me for the haunting surrealism, and yet many of the songs are heartbreakingly sentimal. And no two songs are alike. I must say that for me it was definitely an acquired taste.

I loved my GameDay 2000 for the regular Playstation. But the 2002 version for the Playstation 2 has two flaws that I came across. First, there's a bug in the game so that occassionally, when a team scores a touchdown, it says that the extra point (PAT) was missed even though the user never even had the chance to set up and kick the PAT. The second problem is that no one seems to be able to catch anything. I can understand missing a catch if the receiver is covered, but I rarely connect a pass even with those receivers who are wide open. An honest guess would be 20% of the passes I made were caught in this game -- when the receiver is open. I'm very disappointed with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dud from 989!

Maybe some people were feeling insulted after seeing it (the scene with the little 'Hitler' boy, the scene in Bratislava,...), but the movie is still great. It just shows the American stereotypes about European people (like the [...] guy from Italy,...) and it also shows how American people don't know nothing about the rest of the world (Europe is NOT a country).But all this facts, in the end, make a movie so great.

Although the movie takes some crazy [caraaaazzzzyyyyyy]twists and turns it all turns out to be a terrefic movie with a great ending. My original review gave this movie a negative 2 out of 10 but Hitler boosted it up to a 4. So thank you Hitler."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the least funny movies ever","review":"I saw on the box, \\"From the makers of Old School and Road Trip\\", two movies I found to be hilarious. I figured I'd give this a shot, the Unrated version of course.Pathetic. There isn't one decent gag in the movie. Well, depends on what you mean by \\"gag\\", because that's what I wanted to do when I saw the nude beach scene. Let's put it this way: there is much more full-frontal male nudity in this movie than there is female nudity. If that's your thing, go for it. Not mine, I'll take naked chicks thank you very much.I really could hardly believe how painfully unfunny this movie is. The fight with the robot mime sucked. The soccor team scenes sucked. The \\"Scotty Doesn't Know\\" thing got driven right into the ground, it wasn't funny the first time. The exchange rate thing where U.S. currency got them all kinds of fancy stuff was not funny. None of it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie is horrible","review":"This movie is horrible, there is nothing funny about this movie. It tries to hard to be funny and it never is.

Roadtrip is a classic and this movie is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hooligans saved the movie.","review":"The romp-across-Europe sequence in \\"The Rules of Attraction\\" was much more entertaining and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT AMERICAN PIE!!!","review":"This movie is just like alot of other movies that have came out in the past few years. If you do not own Road Trip or Old School, I recommend picking up those first. I am only 13 but i know my movies. Porky's, Old School, and Road Trip all beat this movie at comedy. Tihs is just my stupid opinion, but trust me they are. The only thing this movie has more of is German Penises, lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of these things are possible","review":"Hey y'all. I lived in Europe in the 80's and the vacations that I took to other locations in europe seemed a lot like this movie. I was in high school during that time and was completely concerned about drink, travel and sex. The best trip was to Lloret De Mar Spain for spring break. Yes, the things in this movie are certainly possible. This movie depicts the things on teenagers minds when they are free to do what they want. The different personalities of the four adventurers show what is important to them. If you review this movie and are critical that it holds no importance to the meaning of life, go take your Centrum Silver, drink some prune juice and go back to the activities room at the old folks home. Some people lose sight that movies like this are made for the fun and entertainment of it. Not to prove something profound. It's an awesome movie. Here in Iraq we use the \\"Escuze\\" line from the train trip to break the bordom. Enjoy it, it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Teen Crap Comedy I Enjoy Watching!!!","review":"Euro trip.

Like American Pie, it has a good heart and likes its characters. Scott, the innocent boy-next-door, gets dumped by his girlfriend and goes to Europe with his friends to track down his hot German pen pal. Of course, they get lost, travel all over Europe, get in a lot of trouble, and have a lot of fun. The film takes potshots at almost every European stereotype but makes it all funny. Given the raunchy subject-matter, I'd recommend getting the unrated edition of this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good movie","review":"i just got back from seeing eurotrip and i thought it was really funny . the main reason i saw eurotrip was because michelle trachtenberg is in it . the movie trailer might lead you to think michelle gets naked in it but unfortunatly she doesn't and doesn't show anything that you can't already see in the movie trailer. but aside from that it is was pretty good so i gave it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst film EVER made","review":"Sounded promising, I don't mind brainless comedies, but this was absolutely the biggest waste of celluoid ever produced.

It features the hedonistic adventures of teenagers taking a trip to Europe (with absolutely no parental permission and/or awareness.) What does that say about American parenting, huh? Secondly, you observe the protagonist teenager having sex with his German pen-pal, and later on they move in together as dorm-mates. In another words, they become co-habitators.

The whole premise of the film is so unbelievable it's rediculous. A few of the jokes are mildly amusing, but not enough to actually laugh just smirk. Most of them, however, are just plain stupid. Granted, Michelle Trachtenberg looks incredible in a bikini & evening gown, and there are plenty of topless women to keep the depraved entertained. But if you're looking for actual enjoyable humor, a plot that makes sense, or something even remotely resembling intelligent film work, then this is definitely not the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Americo-trash","review":"This is the dumbest, most predictable, horrible waste of time i've ever ever seen. This movie tried very very hard to be funny and simply wasn't. It took a pretty good idea and butchered it by cliche jokes and feel good high school humor that's supposed to encourage all of us angsty youngings to go to europe, drink, and copulate with any random gorgious blonde that happens to walk past us.

How could the directors of this movie ever humiliate us Americans, while strongly offending the Europeans?! Why?!Both the commerical and the official site even seem offensive to Europeans! In this movie, it seems the directors want people to perceive Europeans as drunks, sex-addicts and even idiots!Good work to the directors of this film!In this movie, a bunch of Americans go to Europe for a vacation.

The jazz records people played for me at the time were mainly fusion stuff like Weather Report which just seemed to me to be just an attept at low grade rock. One day a friend played this album for me late at night and the music really impressed me. Kind of mellow but still with a driving groove. This is the kind of music I had alway thought jazz sounded like. Even then the vinyl was hard to find so I made a tape of the album (oops - home taping is killing music right?) Over the years I played the tape until it wore out and was never able to find a copy of the record. I'm so pleased that it's out in CD now. If you like good music played by great musicians you will like this.

The book is easy to read and hard to put down. It avoids the trite idealization of the all-knowing therapist and complete, explainable recovery that you see in the movie- a more realistic portrayal of mental illness and its treatment is provided instead.

Otherwise, I receommend this CD without further reservation. I simply have never heard any recorded violin with the tone that Kavakos has--and the same is true of his Enescu/Ravel album. It's also pleasant to hear some rare Stravinsky works--I certainly don't associate violin/piano chamber music with him, especially with a baroque sound as in the Italian suite. The highlight is certainly his Bach--we can hope that Kavakos will give us complete sets of the partitas!

He founded this religion, and then the book goes off into what amounts to office politics as the main protagonist reconfigures the religion, gains or loses control of it and that was it for me.Unlike 'Norwood' and 'True Grit' both of which I enjoyed enormously, this book just didn't work for me.

The maps are somewhat crude at times and it's well worth purchasing topographical maps in addition to the book. Backpackers like to carry as little weight as possible, but I find it worthwhile packing this book along. I hope the author plans on keeping this book updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copyright 1984--Stop the Printing!","review":"Illegible maps, prolix, and outdated, outdated, outdated.

I wasn't very happy with the baritone (not much soul) and although I don't know much about countertenors, I don't think that this one has a very attractive voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite the Messiah","review":"Well...this was a bit disappointing. Ivars Taurins is one of my favorite Canadian choral directors and his choir responds accurately, if not a bit lightly. The Soprano is fine and the Baritone would be if the microphone were not so close to his face. The Tenor, I thought, was very exciting. The Countertenor was not good - hooty in that way countertenors can be - and he seemed to have no connection to the text at all. If Taurins must use a Countertenor, why not Chance, Daniels, Scholl or Taylor ? Anyway, this one went back to the CD store..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as the original","review":"I purchased these several years ago to expand the number of place settings I owned.

She would sit on it and rock for a few seconds at first but would quickly lose interest. Now that we have had the eggplant for 3 months, it has been completely shoved aside.

I am glad that this musician continues to captivates the listener of this new CD as he did in several recital performances I heard in Houston. I am sure that this -unfortunately- underrated artist will eventually gain the recognition he deserves: he impresses with a flawless technique, silken tone, but most of all with performances which do not want to beg for the listener's attention with superficial virtuosity, but draw the listener into the world and imagination of the composer: an approach too rarely displayed by modern soloists.

Throughout it you can trace their development in sound, though the material itself only covers a brief moment of time in Front 242's career, from 1981 to 1985.It is very much a good buy. Fans of Front 242 should get this as it features material from various early albums and EP's by the group, which some may have missed.Sounding much more basic than their later works, the songs on here are early dance songs and electro tracks. It shows the group honing their sound and working on sounds. For those that are not as into their later hard dance works such as 'Up Evil' or 'Off' then this maybe a better bet.The best songs on here are 'U-Men', the instrumental 'Kampfbereit', the almost hip-hop-ish, breakbeat 'Take One', 'Lovely Day' and the swooping 'Don't Crash'."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent early material but BEWARE of what you're getting.","review":"this is a great album. showcases much of 242's earlier material but, i should've looked more closely at amazon's item description. apparently they're making CDR copies on-demand of 'out of print' titles. so, yes, it's a CDR (for 12 dollars). doesn't come with the original artwork, only a bad, digital print of the original artwork and a terribly abbreviated version of it at that.i was hoping to replace my cassette copy of this release with the a factory manufactured CD but am extremely disappointed with the CDR copy i received. i could've illegally downloaded the tracks and burned my own CDR if that's what i was after.AGAIN, BEWARE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"outstanding novel","review":"What a plesant surprise this book was.

Far from it. It's a profound, sometimes brutal portrayal of what becomes of a man and a woman with radically different, antagonistic world views when they're stranded together on a desert island.

Then I wanted to write a paper on it for my undergraduate Cinema Studies class and when I started to do research, I realized this movie was an allegory for the political atmosphere of Italy in the late 60s and early 70s. Being a young American, I was not aware of the struggles and sometimes terrorism that went on there during that period. Even if you don't know about the politics you can still enjoy it if you can get over the woman being hit constantly (it really helps to read what the director said about that, the characters are representations of classes, so it is not about a man beating a woman, but the lower class rising up against their oppressors) [...] is where you can find my paper if you would like to read more on it. Otherwise, a beautiful movie with terrific actors, especially the ruggedly handsome Giancarlo Giannini with his crazed eyes and stellar performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Comedy","review":"I was taken by suprise by this while I was watching television. I immediately ran out and picked it up for myself. First off I want to make it clear that although there is some violence toward women in this Wertmuller is NOT a hater of women. The violence is to show how weak the male characters are to the strength of the women oin the story(THe very end makes that clear). In every film I have seen by Lina Wertmuller the women always come out ahead in the sticky rocky ride of modern Italian relationships.I was floored at this films mix of politics and comedy which is a mix Wertmuller was never afraid to use as often in her career as Hitchcock used \\"the common man accused of a crime and catching the killer to prove himself innocent\\".The performances are amazing and this film ranks amnong the best in the directors career. Highly recommended even if the quality of the dvd is a little off par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Romantic Romp","review":"Viewers actually listening to the Italian or really reading the English subtitles will realize that \\"Swept Away\\" is not a romantic tale of passion but Wertmuller's nasty political tract about class struggle. Raffaela is kicked, punched, sexually subjugated, denied food, and made to beg for love (in a reference to Mary Magdalene, she actually weeps on Giannini's feet)to play out the director's theme turning tables on the arrogant, masterful wealthy class and their Christian Democratic Party social policy. The master/servant role reversal, particularly as a prelude to \\"love,\\" is a bit much. Any stars are due to the remarkable actors, especially Mariangela Melato.If you love Antonioni's great, complex film L'Avventura, you'll howl at the borrowed imagery of the island sequence, complete with a little abandoned hut built into the rocks."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD","review":"Only purchase this DVD if you can understand Italian. Sorry I purchased it because their is no English edition only subtitles. Ruins the story line!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sex and Violence","review":"I saw this movie in an Italian film class. My professor, like the majority of the reviewers here, sees Wertmüller's message of class distinctions in Italian society and gender relationships in civilization easily and applauds her vision. Myself and quite a few of the students in his class cannot. Speaking only for myself, I say that I cannot understand why her message must be polluted with S&M behavior and borderline sexual assault. As an artist I know that there are an infinite number of ways to communicate the differences of class, political ideologies, and sexual relationships without depending on kinky sex and violence. But I also know that censorship is a hateful thing. And so, my review serves as a sort of warning: you will see Oscar-caliber acting, direction and cinematography, but you will also see a very ugly side of humanity, one that I can't agree with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly violent \\"love story\\".","review":"I am a great fan of Giancarlo Giannini. He certainly is very handsome and has a cute body in this movie. But I didn't see anything romantic or funny about a man slapping a woman around to \\"put her in her place\\".

Giancarlo does have a beautiful face though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like this version of the script.","review":"Several versions of this story are out there.

If Italian means sophistication, this one definitely isn't. I was appaled by the notion that a liberated woman would quickly succumb to a \\"natural\\" role of a slave to her \\"master\\". I think this movie is degrading to both men and women. I don't think it has an underlying agenda, in my opinion, it's just plain junk.

Next, I am someone who has a great interest in religion, politics and conflict resolution; yet, this book proved to be a big disappointment. The author spent alot of time talking about irrelevant matters. I was hoping for a summary or introduction even to what the title states (Biblical Justice) but that wasn't delivered. The Bible seemed to be mentioned by the author reluctantly and we are given miniscule bits of information on biblical justice. I'd say a couple of sentences at most in this entire book. What was the author talking about the rest of the time? I don't know either. Not only is the title deceiving, but it's as if the author was at a loss for words or even lacked knowledge on the subject.

Kingsolver knows her way around a phrase, and foreshadows the talents she later put to much better use. But, in Animal Dreams, she lapses into a overly sentimental view of the world. Good and evil are cut from fairly obvious cloth. Women and men fall slightly into this pattern: women have more depth and compassion while the men are emotionally limited people. What I enjoyed most of all were the forays into the non-rational mind of Homer: to me these were the work of a true writer, whose talents had yet to manifest in full. I haven't read Kingsolver's other novels yet, but I will likely do so, thanks to the promise she showed in this mediocre novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad read","review":"The novel is unsophisticated, vulgar and unenlightening.

The ending was too pat and simplistic, as in \\"The Bean Trees\\", and it needed some severe editing, as did \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\".I can't emphasize enough how much I disliked the main character of this book. That, combined with the unrealistic plot, made this book a struggle for me to get through. I was counting the pages, as I did in the last third or so of the vastly superior \\"The Poisonwood Bible.\\"Maybe Kingsolver's writing skills (and decisions about major characters' personalities) will improve with more time. I know she has the potential, so I remain hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"HELP HELP HELP","review":"This book was the worst piece of literature I've ever read. If it was my own property and I wouldn't have to read it for my English class, it would have entertained my garbage can instead. The author seems to have serious trouble with the world around her and a notorious passion for the overuse of metaphores. Two times I actually fell asleep while reading this book. Her characters lack personality, the whole plot seems unrealistic, but as if it tries to convince you of its reality. Especially the main character Cosima, who wants to look like a outsider but then complains about it all the time, is missing a realistic personality.

What I got was the sappy story of Codi Noline's romance with an old high-school boyfriend, and the story of how she \\"finds her past\\" in the town where she grew up. The plot was not at all creative, and like every other romance novel.

I liked the way it was written, and it was easy to read, but it was lacking in the plot department. I didn't really like that it didn't really focus on anything. It was just about this chick and her life and her search to find herself. I, unlike most girls, aren't into \\"chick\\" books, and I thought this was kind of like that. Overall, I'd say take it or leave it. It's well-written with almost no plot.

Unfortunately, Animal Dreams didn't improve my opinion of the author's storytelling. Like the Bean Trees, Animal Dreams seems to be obsessed with the Great White Mother rescuing the poor little red and brown folks out there. It's great that she has a liberal heart and think about political issues that deal with non-whites out there. However, it doesn't translate so nobly anymore. It's starting to sound like Upper Middle Class white Peace Corps volunteer club. Let's have more stories about people helping themselves, rather than a bunch of Halle's rescuing the \\"natives\\" from powers-that-be. Also, the theme of finding the perfect \\"minority\\" mate in both books are getting old.

But I recently picked it up again after a pilgrimage of sorts through the astonishing beauty of the Southwest and its peoples, and found it to be, not only true to the setting, but achingly accurate in its portrayal of the protagonist's despair, struggle, and ultimate redemption. Readers who are tempted to abandon the book early on because they find Codi whiny, self-pitying, and insecure when she first returns to Grace should recognize that epiphany requires the illumination of initial darkness. Kingsolver's exquisite imagery and strong sense of social responsibility only enhance my appreciation of her unlikely heroine's journey to forgiveness, intimacy, and self-reliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally touching","review":"This is what I would call a character book, as distinguished from a strongly plot-driven book. The whole point of the book is the character growth and the emotions which accompany it. The characters are imperfect and complex, characters we can relate to rather than cookie-cutter characters who exist only to act out a plot. Reading this book is an emotional experience. I laughed and I cried, sometimes at the same time. After reading some of the other reviews, I have a hunch that younger readers may not appreciate the book because they simply can't relate to experiences common later in life (death of loved ones, ailing parents, rediscovering yourself, a desire to find your roots, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Found A Character I Know","review":"OK, so a friend of mine had to read \\"The Bean Trees\\" for school a few years ago.

I bought \\"Pigs In Heaven\\" and loved that, too. But last week I checked \\"Animal Dreams\\" out at the library and I fell in love with this book! Kingsolver's style is warm and sympathetic yet honest to her characters. And Codi...here is a character that is me in so many ways. Of course, we are only similar in my own head, but this story has hit me in such a way that I think I might have to go write a song about Loyd's quote about carrying your life with you....GREAT BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional and thought-prevoking","review":"This book depicts very complex characters.

The southwest setting is portrayed beautifully and even meaningfully. Less humor than _The Bean Trees_, but quite compelling. I wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animal Dreams","review":"Animal Dreams was a wonderful story of the life of Codi and her experiences in life that led her to love in the end. She explores her childhood in this book with an unintended fear at first, but slowly moves into feeling comfortable with her life, her past, and her future. It was a wonderful book, one that I related to in many ways. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's all the hype about?","review":"After a few people told me how much they loved this novel (\\"Their favorite book\\", etc.) I gave it a try. There's not much to it. It is not particularly challenging, stimulating or enlightening. It's not that wonderful as a bland romance either. I just don't see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"I was forced to read this book for a college english class I took. It was pure torture. Kingsolver describes everything in such a tedious fashion, it makes you want to find the nearest blunt object and bludgeon yourself to death with it. If you are on your own free will, do not buy this book. If you do...may god have mercy on your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did nothing for me-- this isn't important literature.","review":"I know many people who LOVE Kingsolver, so I decided to take a chance. I hated Animal Dreams, but I thought it would be unfair to judge the author on the basis of one novel, so I read Bean Trees too. My opinion didn't change. I usually read classics or avant-garde literature, and Kingsolver just pales in comparison. She writes faux-important stories for people who want to feel like they've done something magnificent just by reading. Expect a lot more white people trying to take Polaroids at pow-wows thanks to Kingsolver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Were I not afflicted with the vagaries of maleness...","review":"... perhaps I would have appreciated this work.

I'm sure you all know how there are chick flicks(movies directed towards women). Well this is a chick book. There was virtually no plot, I felt like I was reading mindless babble for at least 3/4 of it and by the end was glad it was over. The bottom line is : it's not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what to say...","review":"In a nutshell, there is no way to adequately articulate my disdain for this book through words. To attempt to do so would be akin to channeling a tidal wave through a plastic straw.While the premise of the plot was somewhat promising, everything overall it was just a waste of time. This book is suitable only for happy-ending junkies who need a quick fix without any sort of a meaningful resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time","review":"Unsophisticated, trite, and maudlin. Not a real romance and not a real enlighening read. The story line"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Go Home Again -- Or Can You?","review":"It's said that you can't go home again, but this novel is about what happens when you do. Kingsolver's flowing narrative winds like a river through the lives of the citizens of Grace, Arizona, as seen through the eyes of the prodigal daughter, Codi Noline. At a crossroads in her life, circumstances have brought Codi back to the town of her birth, a place where she and her sister had always felt like outsiders. As she becomes reacquainted with her past, she begins to understand the person that she has always been. This is one of the best books I've read in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRULY AN INSPIRATION","review":"I am a college student and was assigned this book earlier this semester.To be honest I dreaded reading it,however when I picked it up and began to read I could not put it down.It is a very well written book that draws you in.Animal Dreams is about the sense of belonging.Codi is returning to her hometown to confront her ailing father and her past.In this book you will find a complex sense of culture,love,freindship,political issues environmentalism and as I said earlier, the sense of belonging.I highly recommend Animal Dreams.In fact,I recommend Barbara Kingsolver altogether.In my opinion,She has not written a bad book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Animals dream about the things they do in the daytime...","review":"This book was so descriptive.

You feel like you know them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written; Pretty good plot","review":"I thought that the writing style was absolutely fabulous and engrossing. I was able to emotionally hook up and experience the book very vividly. I must mention that although I loved this sort of writing style, some less patient readers might find this as over descriptive.The plot was pretty good, but sometimes predictable and trite.Overall, I would recommend this book. Kingsolver's abilities as a story teller are amazing. In terms of her sort of writing style, I've never read anything like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the ending.","review":"Sometimes a book is worth reading just for the ending. This was one of those for me. However, I also enjoyed the theme of returning to your roots.

By the time I finished reading I was ready for it to go on and on."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!!","review":"I read this book under duress during the summer and I must warn all of you prospective buyers - DON'T DO IT!!! Please, save your money for a book with a plot! I have read some other reviews of this book - they say it is full of beauty and character. The only thing this book is full of is meaningless prattle. But, for all of you who have always wondered what the plants in your garden are thinking . . go right ahead!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Harlequin Romance","review":"If you are the kind of person that likes Harlequin Romance novels, then Barbara Kingsolver is the author for you to check out. If you find people sleeping with Navajos exotic, then this novel is for you. Can you hardly wait for the following: Over the top symbolism? Cramming vague morals down your throat to leave you confused? Character that you can't stand? Wantingso badly for the perspective character in the novel to die that it consumes you? If you answered yes to any of the following then Barbara Kingsolver is the author for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book oever","review":"This book makes no sense, like you don't understand what is going on the whole time. It was a joke of a book to be nice it honestly wasted my time the only reason i read it was for school. It was confusing and just was terrible. If you get this book u r wasting ur money and ur time. If you want to read a good book read The Whore of Akron, great read. This was just terrible. So what if I only read like 8 chapters and sparknoted the rest it still was confusing and made no sense. That is why i had to spark note cause i was lost and had no idea what was going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"not into kingsolver at all...","review":"I tried to read this book, first time around I got half way through, then got bored. It was certainly descriptive, even if I could have cared less about the characters. Also, the writer doesn't write her characters to be likable. So just what is her point?I tried to read it again, and totally didn't like Kingsolver's style of writing. She is boring! Also, she just tries to use big words to make up for lack of talent. This is pure drivel.Try Cathie Pelletier, now there is a writer!Kingsolver is all hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing...","review":"That's the only word to describe this book. Amazingly stupid. Every word of every sentence of every chapter is garbage. Apparently since I am a male I have to live with the stereo type of not being compassionate or sensitive enough to understand 200 pages of babble.Some friends of mine had suggested this book and I can't believe I took them seriously. This must be a cruel joke they are playing on me. The complete absence of story is alarming. It's 300 pages of assorted whining: everyone likes my sister better, I don't have a cause, I don't have anyone to sleep with, I don't fit in anywhere I go, I had a crummy child hood, the poor central Americans. BOO HOO.This book is worse than any of the mass-produced love stories you find at airports. Please spend your money on something more worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This publication should not exist.","review":"WORST BOOK EVER! Kingslover destroyes and dismisses all of the characteristics that create a decent novel. This book is devoid of any plot or driving force for the main character to face. Kingslover has the uncanny ability to spend hundreds of pages, for a main character to dream and wish of a past that she clearly never had and cannot reclaim. As pointed out by a friend of mine during Senior English (the year myself and others were forced to read this atrocity), all of the lessons that one could possible come away with from this book are present in the Disney film, The Lion King. \\"Remember who you are\\", and remaining true to your past, all of which are present in a kid's movie. I would reccomend this book for anyone who enjoys, reading about horny Native Americans, and 300 pages of liberal dribble so humanity shan't forget the electrical engineer who died in Latin America. To quote Comic Book Guy \\"WORST BOOK EVER!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Animal Dreams is smart and funny and heartbreaking all at the same time. Two sisters - one who incorrectly ascribes all of her heroic childhood acts to her sister, and the other, who really has grown up to be a hero. How much of ourselves do we define, just by believing it hard enough, and how much of that is the belief of other people around us? I often don't like books about women who have lost everything, but that's because the idea of willing victimization and an inability to function annoy me in a book (can you hear me, She's Come Undone?) but there are no victims in this book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"I liked this book, although Poisonwood Bible is even better. I'm disturbed by some of the negative reviews here. If you read her novels carefully, it is obvious that Kingsolver is writing about people trying to understand each other, not about converting people. I liked the motif of animal dreams and the relationships delineated within the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I was quite disappointed that a book that was marketed as literature could be filled with so much garbage. I found the main character's discovery of the native Americans to be not much more than the \\"noble savage\\" mistake. Especially nauseating was her reference to the \\"bread that smelled like love.\\" Although I agree with the author's point of view about Central America and about the environment, I found her so preachy that I wanted only to disagree with her!! One bright spot is the inclusion of sections written in the father's point of view. These parts were ethereal, poignant and not sappy at all. I'd only recommend this book to someone who likes romance novels but is embarrassed to carry around those garrish softcovers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another elegant novel from Barbara Kingsolver","review":"I am a fan of Kingsolver and have read all her novels. She never disappoints. She is adept at interweaving remarkable characters with real-life issues, in this case environmental poisoning by monolithic corporations that appear to be unapproachable and unbending. Her mastery of dialogue and character development is a joy to experience. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Company","review":"Book came in great condition!

The hole seems to be to big for it. The top crossbar on the headboard spins as well. It is garbage. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of sh*t","review":"This bed is AWFUL. Please please stay away from it, my so (16 months old, 24 pounds) got up on it and bounced ONCE and the entire thing cracked. The wooden jagged edges were so dangerous I was lucky to get my son out of this bed unharmed. Then to top it all off, when I called customer service they said since I had used wood glue to reinforce the (very very weak) slabs I had deactivated the warranty and they wouldn't honor it! So here I am, 100 dollars down the drain, with no bed for my toddler and I have to load this piece of crap into the car and pay to dump it. RIDICULOUS. I don't understand the high reviews, please NO ONE buy this bed it is a safety hazard."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweet and cute","review":"We got this bed to transition our 2 year old out of his crib. It's easy to put together, well made, nice finish. It fit his crib mattress perfectly. It's only about 12\\" off of the floor, so even if he wriggled around so much that he fell out (past the side bars, not likely), he wouldn't fall very far (and it's never happened). It's great that it's so low, because he can get into bed by himself. The only caveat is that it has a 70 lb. weight limit, so don't kneel on it when you are tucking in, and our 5 year old boy can't play with his little brother on it. No great loss. Definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bed. My daughter loves it.","review":"So my daughter loves her new bed. It's her own little big girl bed. It's actually quite sturdy. When we received the box in the mail my husband looked at me like what the heck is this. Her bed fit it that, but it turned out great. Perfect size for a toddler and sturdy enough for me to sit on and read to her. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice bed","review":"Nice bed. My wife was looking for something like this, but the prices were high... this bed is at good price and is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I have had this for about 5 months now and so far it has held up well. I would have made it 5 stars but it was scratched (small) in a few places from shipping. I didn't think it was worth the shipping to send it back and get a placement. My son loves his big boy bed. Only fell out a few times at night for about a week and then he had it figured out. I recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good","review":"This toddler bed looks nice and seems to be working. It was an adjustment going from crib to the bed, but that would be the case for any toddler bed. Light weight, but I feel comfortable draping my upper body across it to give my toddler a snuggle before bed. Color is accurate to picture shown."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK, So I'm a dolphin!","review":"This is great! I took the test in the book and I turned out to be my favorite animal -- a dolphin! (I surf and ski, but I don't have sex quite THAT often!) My boyfriend is a sea-lion, so I guess we're quite compatible. What a cool book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction","review":"Most of this book aims to 'teach as you play', with eight original (but not too bad) ragtime guitar solos, ranging in difficulty from fairly easy to moderately difficult, presented alongside performance tips and lots of photos of hand positions. It won't teach you much about the theory behind ragtime guitar, but it does a good job of pointing out the relevant parts in the solos so that, hopefully, you'll absorb it by osmosis. And it works! Well, sort of. Whether you end up able to improvise ragtime guitar or not, you'll certainly know a hell of a lot of licks to amaze any old folks who may happen to remember one of the ragtime revivals. (Plus, you'll be prepared for the next one). Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clowns on the Midway","review":"This CD is right on for working the Crowd.

I won't be doing this. The Calliope sound was clear and great, but the quality of the bass instrument (Tuba?) was fuzzy sounding, not clear. It was annoying to me. Not being a musician, I don't know how to best describe it, but it was not good. There was a great selection of Carousel Music on this CD.Good Old USA Carousel Music Vol. 1"},{"rating":"2","title":"grinning from ear to ear","review":"I started to smile as soon as I saw the photo on the cover.

The music is captivating, and you just can't help but smile as you listen.I bought the CD for use at a church Halloween \\"Carnival\\" that is meant to be more fun than scary. I think this will definitely set the mood. This old fashioned sound and style cannot be duplicated or replicated with todays modern keyboards.

Almost like there was some kind of a frequency clipper on the microphone(s) or maybe they were in the wrong place and were overloaded. Whatever the reason I think this CD needs to be remastered (or something) to fix this problem before it can be truly enjoyable. I note also a similar comment about the Volume II CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't poke the bear at the zoo","review":"This is a great movie, start to finish. Famke Janssen (X-Men, Goldeneye, etc.), Jon Favreau (who also wrote this movie) are the stars. This movie covers all facets of the relationship and is a great movie. Cheri O'Teri, who I couldn't stand in SNL, does a serviceable job here. This movie has great dialogue and acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this movie","review":"This movie is one of the best movies I've seen in years. I loved the story. The cast was great. The dialogue was without a doubt funny. You've got to see this movie.

This one is definitely on my list of favorite movies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love movies with great dialogue!","review":"As a fan of movies that have good dialogue, this one is on my list, along with When Harry Met Sally and Before Sunrise. It's a simple movie about finding the right person in life. Isn't that what so many people spend years of dating trying to determine? This movie approaches relationships in a very honest, funny, and refreshing way. The chemistry between Femke Jaansen and John Favreau is great as they go through the ups and downs of being in a relationship. This movie is for anyone in a relationship...or just wondering when they will ever find their special someone."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENTERTAINING LOOK AT RELATIONSHIPS","review":"You wouldn't think so, but Jon Favreau and Famke Janssen have a great deal of on-screen chemistry. I also would not guess that Janssen had the comedic abilities that she displays in this film. The film chronicles a relationship between Favreau and Janssen in its various stages from meeting to the first parts of the relationship to the tough times the break-up, the post break-up trying to make each other jealous, and if I am not mistaken, they do reconcile in the end? It has been about a year since I saw this film, so forgive me if I am wrong. I do know they at least end up as friends. While the concept of the film is nothing new, there is something fresh and charming about the way their relationship develops and how the characters perceive their lives and themselves within and outside of their relationship. Both characters are endearing in their own ways, and you genuinely feel what each is going through. (Also this film boasts a good soundtrack)."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and charming","review":"Found this simple movie refreshing, humorous, and charming. Leading actors compliment eachother very well without being over the top. definitely more of a realistic love comedy than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"I saw this movie on TV and fell in love with it.

This movie is appropriate for guys and girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny & honest!","review":"Great movie, writing is great. Love Famke & Jon, they make a great on-screen couple. Made me re-live parts of my own past!Man will love this movie also, even if they watch it when nobody else is home...:-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"Considering the movie's somewhat low profile, this came as a pleasant surprise to me. In this romantic comedy, both Famke Janssen and Jon Favreau absolutely shine. their on-screen chemistry is superb, and seems amazingly natural. Favourite scenes of mine, include the first date (where Jon comments on Famke's history of men with the line \\"you're...like a whore!\\"), the farting in bed scene (- hilarious, and Famke's reaction to Jon looks so natural it's hard to believe she was acting!), and an excellent cameo from David Schwimmer towards the end of the film. Also worth pointing out is the Robert De Niro wannabe, who just loves to impersonate his favourite actor. I haven't seem many films starring either of the two leads featured here, but both Jon and Famke give top-notch performances. My only criticism of the film - and this is nit-picking really - is that it's too short. Otherwise, hugely enjoyable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This is a great movie. I bought it at Hollywood Video when they were closing here in Albuquerque N.m. It was close to closing day, so there weren't many movies to chose from. I think I bought four or five movies that day.

The closest equivalent is Kraftwerk's \\"Man-Machine\\" album. I really don't know whether or not \\"Trans\\" is a nod to the early techno style or a parody of it--not even the K-bots themselves overdid the machine aspect that much (\\"Man-Machine\\" with its vocoder vocals was the most extreme). I only know that versatility can be overdone--if Young had less stature than he has, \\"inconsistency\\" might instead be the word. Maybe it's because of his contract with Geffen at the time--he commented when he got back with Warner that they had a bias towards techno-pop. Myself, I expect Neil to be Neil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Techno Trash Trans","review":"4 stars? 5 stars? Come on now! \\"Transformer Man\\" ONLY works as an acoustic track on \\"UNPLUGGED\\".

But in the 80's, a Golden Era for Rock Giants like Yes, Genesis and Rush, he decided to explore new sounds and therefore expand himself as an artist. I am one of the few lucky persons who owns this LP on vynil, bought in Italy the very same year it was released, and I hope things like this would come back soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Underrated Album","review":"I'm not sure why so many people don't like Trans, but I love it. I am a Neil Young fan, and I understand why Trans is sort of a shock to a lot of people, because it's incredibly different from a lot of his other work. However, the songwriting is as strong as ever, and I personally love the music too (yes including the heavy vocoder use!). Besides the vocoder songs, there are 3 songs which feature Neil's regular voice. To me, Transformer Man is a wonderful song, especially when viewed in the context that it's about Neil's son Ben. Sample And Hold and Like an Inca are my other two favorite tracks from this album, but all nine tracks are good. Don't judge this album before you hear it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of it's time","review":"Really, in 1982 this album was far ahead of its time lyrically. Take a listen to \\"Computer Age\\" and \\"We R In Control\\" with a lyric sheet in hand and you'll know why. Today, computers have an impact on virtually everything we do in life. Musically, this was a hard left turn into oncoming traffic for Neil as this was very different from anything that he had previously recorded. Now that we know Neil's reasons for recording this as he did (the inability to communicate with his son), the album has a dual meaning. It is time that Neil or Geffen/Universal re-release this album stateside as it's time has come.PS-In my opinion, Re-ac-tor was the first hint of this inability to communicate. Notice how everything is spelled out in syllables on the album cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I was the only one who wanted this!","review":"I used to have this tape but it was stolen some 10 years ago. I've been searching for it ever since so I'm glad to finally have it back. The only reason I bought this was back in the 80's I saw a Neil Young concert on HBO that was recorded in Germany. Back then Young was lost in the US but the Germans loved him because of the crazy synth voice he uses in this album. I immediately liked the song \\"Sample and Hold\\" along with the old songs like \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" so I was an instant fan from that day on. I have an LP of Neil Young's greatest hits that I have never seen on CD. I think they stopped production because it contains the best of the best on one album, such as \\"Hey,Hey,My My\\" and \\"Like a Hurricane\\" so it probably hurt sales for his Crazy Horse and solo albums. Any way, this is one thing I get to check off my wanted list."},{"rating":"1","title":"neil young trans","review":"Bought it onlyto replace my vinyl.

When it was time to go she cried all the way home untill we put her back in it!! She would have slept in it it we would have let her. Now she's 10 months - and still loves it the same!

At first, this volume was a little intimidating because it is organized by the scientic names of all the plants. Once I got the hang of looking up the common name in the back, then finding the cross-referenced scientific name, it's wonderful! My friend, a much more accomplished gardener than I, used the book to help with our plant sale and the questions customers had about the perenials we had for sale. The pictures are amazing. I have identified in my back yard many of the plants I'd been previously pulling as weeds...I'm also looking up how to separate and move these wonderful newfound treasures, so the book can pay for itself -- all in all, a great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AHS Encyclopedia of Perennials","review":"This is a great reference book that is also fun to just page through.

During some very hot days a few weeks ago, I was told that hanging these blankets in my south- and west-facing windows would make my it feel \\"like having air conditioning\\" in my house. At such a low price, I couldn't pass up the chance to try this. The 4 pack was actually perfect for fitting in my four windows, without any need to cut the blankets down. I didn't actually attach them to my windows either. I stapled them to the inside of the curtain and that allows me to open the curtains if I choose.The thermal blankets really reflect a lot of sunlight, which keeps it much cooler in my house. They do make it slightly darker, but they are not anywhere close to blacking out all the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Space Blankets","review":"For the price and quantity I'm not going to complain. They are compact enough for the glove box, a small pocket in the BOB and in my motorcycle tool bag. I'm not going to count on them in my long term camping gear to be of the quality of the space blankets I'm familiar with. The last ones I opened and used had an OD green outside, a mesh thread pattern for strength, and grommeted corners, and once I open them they kicked around for years, just never fold up as compact as originally. Those are Space Blankets, these are a cheaper alternative for short term emergency use. I opened one of these up, they are the advertised size and weight and work as advertised, I wouldn't count on it lasting more than a few days to a couple of weeks of use, in other words, an emergency only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Recommended not to purchase.

It's a fine example of wisdom and compassion, of tolerance and discipline, of shared joy and personal responsibility. It is an inspiration. It is good to encounter an author filled with Buddhism's optimism and realism.--This book, and its outlook, is also an excellent antidote for times when one just feels kind of briefly overwhelmed by the negative craziness in the world (in other words, dukkha).

As we become more aware of our awareness, we begin to identify with our soul's guidance in the world over our personality's need to be in control. In this surrendered state of being, we become our authentic self. We become more soul than body living in the world, and yet, not fully of it. Thanks, Jack Kornfield, for this blueprint into the nature of soul. -- Samuel Oliver, author of, What the Dying Teach Us: Lessons on Living."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great experience","review":"My first Amazon transaction.

You have to poke holes in it yourself so that the water can get in and the chlorine tablet can activate. This was no small task because there are about 30 holes that I had to poke and the plastic is pretty thick. The instructions tell you how many holes to poke according to the size of your pool. The other chlorinator that I had came with the holes already in it and it also unscrewed so that you could put in the tablets. This one is a little awkward because you have to pull off the bottom part then force it back on.

The film was a fictious account of how congressman John Raymond's involvement in the criminal underworld leads to corruption in the highest places. He is later exposed by Cloe and Nicole in a threesome 'sting'. The sountrack ( and a handful of video tapes) is all that is left of the film. The score was composed and produced by the SPANK duo TC and Randy Winklemann (Dj stubble is on hand for scratching duties). The music is a variety of styles with heavy funk and early hip-hop influences and captures the sleazy atmosphere of the film perfectly - enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and poignant","review":"This is the most inspiring leadership book I've read in 2 or 3 years. It deserves a place along side the very best leadership books of today, even Douglas McGregor's The Human Side of Enterprise or John Gardner's On Leadership. In short, Tead finds the words to describe the very highest aspirations of leaders. Tead is a true believer that leadership (to paraphrase FDR) is a moral cause. To summarize the book, Tead argues that character and values do matter in leadership. As far as the book's age (it was published in 1935), I would say that the last third of the book (where Tead deals with sexual politics in the workplace) shows the greatest signs of being outdated. But the rest of this book is terrific and deserves a place in anyone's leadership library.

When we took it to watch repair they said they'd never seen such a bad case of rust and it couldn't be repaired. We were able to return it and get our money back. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water Resistant?! Nice joke.","review":"Within the first month I had to replace this product because it had condensation on the inside. The customer service told me that it is not water resistant despite the logo of a guy swimming on the back of the watch and \\"30 feet water resistant\\". Just this week, after having been very careful not to get it wet, and taking it off before jumping in the shower, the new watch got more condensation in it and stopped working. It must have been the steam in the shower!! Terrible buy. I wish they would reimburse the purchase or issue a recall. This is not something an American company should be producing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair to Midland","review":"Found this watch to have cool features and easy to setup. Easy to use.Only problem is the information it gives was not always right! Altitude was close but varied from 30' to 170' OFF. Barometer was never right and calibrated correctly. maybe works better staying outside. Commercial buildings are pressurized, could be the issue??? Temp was as instructed, must be removed from wrist for several minutes to get ambient temperature; that was accurate. Compass was jerky and hard to settle down, not fluid-like movement but accurate outside. Compass was also too sensitive, would not work near metal i.e. in the vehicle or aircraft, near other electronics.

It has great features and design. The price is very good also. So what's wrong? Wear it in the shower once and it's ruined despite being marked water resistant to 100ATM. LaCrosse says their warranty does not cover damage from water leaking in because they say it is not waterproof and should not get wet. Duh? Then why do they advertise \\"water resistant\\" as a feature? Lacrosse customer service told me not to believe what it says on the watch or the specs. The reality is the watch can't get wet. And I can't recommend it. At least it has a weather indicator so I know when it's gonna rain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metallic Look but case made of plastic and breaks easily","review":"I had this watch for a few months, and feature wise it meets all my expectations, but I snagged it in my backpack the other day and the strap with the pins came off. No big deal I thought, I'll just snap it back in - that's when I noticed that the strap holder had ripped through the PLASTIC casing and was thus unrepairable. Over the few months I have had it, it has also discolored badly on the fake metal casing. Great features, poor build quality. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"This watch is a pretty good deal for the price. It is a little complicated to figure out, but after playing with it for awhile you'll get the hang of it.It's not the best construction, but it's not that expensive either. It was pretty helpful on my recent trip up Mt. Kilimanjaro. I did need to recalibrate the elevation pretty frequently though. Ascending from 3000m to 5895m it drifted about 200m. When calibrating at elevation, sometimes it doesn't believe you so you might have to put the elevation in a few times.I noticed that some complain about the water resistant-ness. The documentation says that it is water resistant to 100 ft, but cautions not to use it (push buttons) underwater. It's done fine for me with splashing, showers, dishwashing, river/lake bathing, etc. I haven't tried diving with it since it wouldn't be accurate anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Crosse XG55 Altimeter Watch","review":"Owned this watch only briefly, had no problems in that short time, but did not get the reason for the backward compass (you could set it so it says west when you're really facing east. Once I figured that out, I changed it back and all was right with the world.) One thing to note, though: the rubber watch bands on two other watches broke after less than 18 months, the second in several places. This has the same rubber as the other two. And the battery in the K2-100 (predecessor to the XG55) had to be replaced after only 9 months. Also, the ability to enter the known sea-level pressure to determine your altitude is a feature included in the XG55 that was sorely missing on the K2-100. Bottom line: they fixed a couple of deficiencies since the K2-100, and it costs half the price of the nearly identical Suunto Vector (their cheapest watch with a compass AND an altimeter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair","review":"I received this watch as a gift after reviewing several others.

Cashelmara is on that list, along with Howatch's other \\"family sagas''. She brings the reader into each narrator's mind, allowing the reader to find things about each one to identify with. Cashelmara tells the story of two generations of English lords who own an estate in Ireland during the turbulent years of the potato famine and Parnell. Each marries an American bride which brings another dimension to the story. While this book has adult themes, it doesn't dwell on the act so much as the aftermath. This is powerful novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cashelmara","review":"Unlike some of the reviewers, I read this book because I liked the Church of England series. This \\"family\\" history was captivating and unusual because each section was told through the eyes of different family members. It was somewhat like looking at the family through a prism. Ms. Howatch writes delicately and well and manages to adjust her style to the different characters' styles and personalities.Although the book is long, it is not a difficult book to read.

Oh well, I thought I was supposed to say something nice. The acting is terrible, the plot ridiculous, in fact this movie is so bad it is almost funny, I say almost or I might have given it two stars. Keanu Reeves really embarrasses himself with this one. He should stick to movies like Speed or Matrix, where all he has to do is look cool and pretty. This one needed some acting and he wasn't really there for most of it. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Walk in the Clouds","review":"When I saw the 4.5 stars average for this title, I felt I couldn't pass it by. Folks, this high rating is not indicative of the qulity of this show. I admonish anyone contemplating buying it to rent it first. You just might save yourself some money!I rented this with the intention to watch it with my wife. The result was a movie that set the standard for terrible \\"chick-flick\\" trash. My wife, a romance movie fan, still chides me about picking this one out.

Unfortunately, it is not available in the US even on VHS.As with all other Hollywood remakes of classic Italian films, this one fails miserably. The original ends making you realize that one has to make sacrifices in life and keep ones promises, and the Hollywood ending.. of course a cheesy happy go lucky one. As for Keanu Reeves, the casting of him in any movie where he has to speak more than five sentences is futile.I wish Hollywood would stop remaking and ruining classic films, especially Italian films e.g Lina Wertmuller's Swept Away v.s. Six Days Seven Nights.. which of recent Madonna wants to take a second crack at it.That is Hollywood for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"When I received the package I realized that I had been sent the wrong movie.

Believe me, I gave it a chance, thinking I was too tired, or too awake, or too stupid to understand what other people find in this film.Sure, the acting was awful. A good actor would improvise and *never* deliver the dreary lines they were dished out with this screenplay. I feel pretty sorry for them, since their careers were set back quite a bit with this junk.Anyone that considers this film a great romance has a lot of film viewing yet to do. Anyone that considers the screenplay well written is probably illiterate. My copy of the DVD is now sitting out on the front curb with my trash, so if anyone wants it they can take it away with the rest of the garbage. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Minus 1","review":"This is one of my classic stand-bys for when I want an escape. I love the lush scenery, the realistic plot, and the integrity of the script. The only real detraction for me in this is (obviously) Mono-Keanu. The guy can't act his way out of a wet paper bag but, luckily, his acting isn't bad enough to sink the ship. One note to the \\"Official\\" Amazon reviewer: It's very well demonstrated (both visually and audibly) that the reason the family and farm hands are using the silk-like wings in the vineyard is to try to distribute the heat from the fires burning in the cans down to the grape vines (not to chase away insects, as you wrote). There is a frost warning for that night, and that's why everyone scrambles to get the heat down to the grapes. Frost + grapes = bad wine, I guess.

Paul suggests that he be her husband for a day to ease her back into the household, and then he'd take off to finish his trip. Her family has other ideas. And these you have to see for yourself. There are many comedic spots, a lot of romance, sexual inuendo, but no out-right nudity. We do see Paul's chest once or twice. I don't mind watching this one with my kids in the room. The scenery is fabulous. Napa Valley, California. Grape vineyards from one end of the screen to the other.

Ah, such disappointments are not rare enough, sorry to say.This was my first Keanu, and I believe it shall be my last. I think he might make a very good Curious George, but he's not a good leading man at all. Anthony Quinn at 80 is more attractive than this whippersnapper will ever be.Other parts of the movie are not so bad, so if you want to go for a stroll, take \\"A Walk in the Clouds\\", but you won't bump into anything like an excellent movie while you're up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GREAT OLD FASHION FILM BUT WHO NEEDS BLU RAY?","review":"I would love to hear on all movies that are also on blu ray a seperate review and whythat movie should be bought on \\"BLU RAY\\"I give ONE star to the film being a wonderful, beautiful, old fashion movie that I loved.But zero to \\"Blu Ray.\\" Why pay for what seems like mostly new packaging, based onproduct information. \\"Blu Ray\\" didn't seem to take the time to restore the picturebut this disk offers NO OTHER FEATURES.

However, this movie did have an overall good theme about family and love.All in all, I don't recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good romance.

The film captures the wine region very well, and it is just a nice love story that isn't too corny ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give It a Chance","review":"I'm not a Keanu Fan and did not want to see this movie, but my girlfriend finally won out. I watched this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Think \\"Fools Rush In\\" but on a more serious note. The movie takes place on a winery (which is probably why I liked it) with knowledge grandparents and a likable character played by Keanu this movie may be better then you expect it to be. It at least deserves a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Here's a good example of why Tom Keough writes about movies instead of making them.A Walk In The Clouds is a beautiful film that harkens back to the Golden Age of movies. The cinematography is stunning, the visual effects (especially those of the vineyards) are gorgeous and the script is simple, precise and elegant. It's fashionable these days to slam Keanu Reeves. But if you'd like to see another example of spares, controlled acting that conveys a remarkably strong screen presence you need look no further than Gregory Peck.Reeves is perfect in the role of the war weary soldier, returning from war, who is unsure about his place in the world as he tries to reaclimate to society. He rediscovers his life by helping a beautiful woman and in the vineyards of California. You'll love this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie is wonderful. It is great to see a movie that isn't loaded with violence.( There are a couple of very brief scenes of the war, but nothing shoot 'em up wise.) It is romantic, and yes maybe it is predictable, but it is still a wonderful movie that leaves you feeling warm and fuzzy. This is a movie that I actually let my children watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly good movie","review":"I liked this movie well enough. It isn't action packed but its interesting enough to hold your interest throughout. The acting is fairly good and the plot is interesting and well told. Its a good movie for a date as there is no nudity (and it doesn't totally suck like allot of date movies do).I think you should save yourself some money though and just get the dvd as bluray is a bit dissapointing to me. Unless you have a huge screen telivision with a tremendously nice sound system, the quality of bluray won't be worth the extra price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk in the Clouds","review":"Didn't know about this movie until a friend told me about it.If you and your lady are fighting, nothing we'll say your sorry better then watching this movie with her.P.S. don't forget the popcorn and box of 2-ply tissues."},{"rating":"2","title":"TAKE THIS WALK AND BE SWEPT AWAY.....","review":"Sure it's somewhat obvious. Sure Keanu Reeves isn't about to bowl over the Oscar people. Sure the whole film is a chick flick done up to the ninth degree. But... with all that, some spectacular photography of the Napa valley (which should be seen in widescreen on DVD! if and when they see fit to release it in the format)and a haunting Maurice Jarre score, it's very effecting and undeniably romantic. Curl up with your best love and watch the movie (this means you guys!) and you might be surprised to find that you don't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great scenery, if nothing else","review":"Predictable and shallow plot, some good acting by Anthony Quinn, but not much else. I'm glad I rented this and didn't buy it. Kenau Reeves isn't much of an actor anyway and the script of this picture didn't help him out much.

Unless your a fan of wine country flicks, give this one a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine movie, not so good acting","review":"Great scenery in the movie. The acting is not great, but the story flows, so you end up rooting for love and happiness after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"DECREASING CLOUDINESS AND WARMER","review":"Long before Keanu Reeves became involved in incomprehensibile \\"Matrix\\" movies, he was perfeectly cast in this romantic tale that even \\"Scrooge\\" might have liked. In fact, the entire cast seems to be acting properly, a rarity these days. Keanu returns home from war to a wife now alien to him. He rides toward Sacramento on business and is accidentally attracted to a pregnant girl returning home from college to her strict Spanish family. He agrees to act as her husband for one, then two days to ensure the girl's physical well being. The couple quickly becomes emotionally attached, but Reeves remains true to his wife. Upon his return home, Keanu is served annulment papers from his wife, and he bolts like a thoroughbred back to his new wife to be. However, this cursory review hardly begins to describe a beautifully photographed, mature,romantic film that seems to have been forgotten in recent years.Don't you forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"While Keanu Reeves belongs to what I call the \\"Paper Bag\\" school of acting (namely, that is, what he couldn't act his way out of) this movie manages a sweet charm all of its own. I believe that many people have discounted this film mainly because of its star (who before recently was known more for playing Ted \\"Theodore\\" Logan than Mr. Neo \\"The One\\" Anderson). While the film may follow the traditional story of two people pretending to be in love and then actually falling in love, it is told in such a sweet manner that it's hard to find fault with it. Even I find myself getting caught up in the emotions of the film. This movie is filled with humor, drama and in the end makes a nice romantic film. However, if you're looking for hard hitting drama, or extremely though provoking dialogue and plot, this movie isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flip Flops","review":"This video tape flip flops all the way through.

Happy for men is classified as a refreshing, citrus fragrance. This scent possesses a blend of citrus lemons, mandarins, oranges and grapefruit. Happy for men aftershave balm adds a light refreshing fragrance when worn with Happy cologne. This fragrance is packaged in a masculine bright orange bottle with a silver cap and comes in an orange box to match. Also by Clinique is Chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but..","review":"This cologne is just ok because the smell is very generic. There are at least 25 colognes with a similar clean scent. The problem with this product also lies with it's price. This cologne is way overpriced for what it is. There are far better scents available for the same price, or up to $5 more. Even Cool Water which is far above this product, costs less. The people at Clinique are known for their skin products which are top-notch. But in the cologne market, they are not competitively priced to sell a lot of this scent. They probably don't care because their meat and potatoes are the skin products they sell. But if you're going to spend this much on a clean scent, you'd be better off trying R DeCappucci, Vetiver, Aqua Di Silva, Gendarme, or Terre D'Hermes.

The action is horrid- very slow and choppy- not the typical action you'd expect from Jackie. Clearly, the American director and stunt choreographers were not familiar with Jackie's abilities and style, and the film suffers because of it. Well, that and the fact that the plot is really flat and stupid.

The big difference? Bruce Lee had control over his movie and no qualms about voicing his opinion. Jackie on the other hand, had no control or influence over this film. The result is a convoluted mess with the worst Jackie Chan fight scenes you will ever see, but what can you expect when he is fighting untrained actors instead of martial artists? My recommendation would be to avoid this movie unless you want to see what happens when the 1930s meet roller derbies, mid-century automobiles and really bad professional wrestling."},{"rating":"2","title":"jackie chan movie","review":"my husband cant say nothing bad about his movies he just loves jackie chan movies ALL of them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not new as promised, 35 days for delivery and then not operational!","review":"I did not know until after I ordered this item that it would take 30+ days to get to me.

Unless a person learns to be less selfish, I am quite sure a man will discover that the perfect girl friend, who has now become the perfect wife, will in no time turn into what the author calls Wife One, Wife Two or Wife Three, which are three stereotypical kinds of problem wives.

Though it's steeped in 80s pop culture, and is sure to be dismissed by Interpol-fawning goth kids, it's an intensely focused work for such a young band. And though their influences are there on the surface -- Joy Division, The Cure, Nick Cave, and many more -- their songs are sharp, their lyrics meaningful, the production crisp without overwhelming the passion. The music might be depressive -- or, at the very least, minor chord -- but the lyrics have an outreach beyond the navel-gazing of most of what passes for \\"goth\\"; and those are certainly pop hooks I hear on the 11 tracks of the formal CD. And, for good measure, there's a bonus CD called Cuttings with six tracks of thrash and drone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new discovery","review":"Didn't know them until I heard them on the radio.

Tom Smith has a voice reminiscent of Paul Banks and even Eddie Vedder at times, however he makes it his own. My favorite songs are \\"Lights\\", \\"Munich\\", \\"Fall\\", \\"All Sparks\\", \\"Fingers in the Factories\\", and \\"Open Your Arms\\". I'm going to San Francisco to see them at the end of April. I've heard they're amazing live and I don't doubt it one bit. I've heard San Diego radio stations playing \\"Munich\\" already and Rodney on the Roq in L.A plays it on his show sunday nights. The comparison will always exist, but any music lover should appreciate Editors! Oh, and by the way, it's Editors. Not THE Editors. Just Editors. I wonder why they didn't add THE.

Echo, Joy Division...both British...Perhaps you are a bit biased because Interpol are from NY also?

Low, down grade lyricist, overlayed with stinging guitar riffs, easy base numbers and drums that bang. I am listening to the band for the first time. I can definately put comparisons with Interpol, early Joy Division, Echo and others, but Editors are definately none of the mentioned before. They have a keen sense of what they like, want and where they are going. Any time you can listen to the first 5 songs and not remember the last 14 and 1/2 minutes, you are in musical paradise.

The song Munich (one which I'd associate the most with Interpol) does have a catchy hook, but the rest of the album fails to capture the same magic. I hope they continue exploring their sound and I wish them well, but as things stand, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it. It's just not one of those albums that you can play all the way through and without skipping over some songs (like you can 'Turn on the Bright Lights' or 'Hot Fuss').Ultimately, one gets the feeling that they are just trying to cash in on the current trend in music and creating forgettable material in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Idlewild?","review":"Excellent.. but it is not Joy Division (apart from the Peter Hook bass) it is Idlewild.

In twenty years when you see Interpol tribute bands playing your local saloon, they'll only wish they sounded as much like Interpol as the Editors.Personally, I wouldn't listen to this CD twice.

Quite possibly the single most gifted artist the world will ever know, the public can gain an insight into his style and technique of first sculpting in clay before moving on to more costly slabs of marble or even bronze. Well worth the read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the series","review":"This is the worst (and final) book of Lewis' space trilogy. Here, his apparent lack of forethought and organization culminate in \\"That Hideous Strength\\" where Lewis seems to drift aimlessly among topics of space travel and other worlds, to British monarchistic nationalism, Arthurian legends, angelology, human psychology, reincarnation, mad scientists, and marriage life.In short, while I enjoyed \\"Out of the Silent Planet\\" and gained some pleasure from Perelandra, this final book was a horrible amalgamation of aimless themes, lacked a concise plot, and left the reader (at least this reader) disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Read Only","review":"It's an old book as the cover and the pages are quite brittle. The book is already falling apart and I've only had it 2 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkien well described it as \\"That Hideous Book,\\"","review":"The literary disaster that ends Lewis' 'Space Trilogy'.Unlikeable or unconvincing good guys, cardboard villains, and a wandering plot could not be spruced up into anything interesting, either by a surprise visit from an historical Merlin, reanimated human body parts, or even a grown bear thrown in as a full-fleged party member.Lewis over-reached himself in this one. Be a big Lewis fan and brew a big pot of coffee if you plan on finishing it.Better to read Til We Have Faces, if you're looking for some readable and thoughtful adult fiction by Lewis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete drek","review":"Don't waste your time on this unmittigatedly boring tripe. If you truly want to have your mind and soul stimulated, read something more challenging, like Glenn Kleier's THE LAST DAY. Now that novel will keep you up biting your nails and hanging on for the stunning conclusion. LAST DAY has substance where STRENGTH has none."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd best fiction ever written!","review":"This is my 2nd favorite fiction ever, right after Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand. \\"Hideous\\" is brilliant because it combines a pragmatic look at evil people and diabolical conspiracies with a wit and humor that keeps me laughing on almost every page.And in classic Lewis style, interwoven everywhere are religious allegories and symbolism. This book is a treat, like a creamsicle on a summer afternoon.I was confused at the beginning since the story seems to suddenly break from the 1st two in the trilogy, both in storyline, and in the fact that there seems to be no science fiction in Hideous. But everything becomes clear later on, and the trilogy is truly continued.This may become known as the most undiscovered book of the 20th century, but it's a classic and a literary jewel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Space trilogy concludes","review":"The final book in Lewis's Space Trilogy finds Dr. Ransom confronting a huge international organization bent on the submission of the human race and given to all kinds of strange scientific experiments and with one supreme goal--to eliminate all free thinking and emotion. This organization, the N.I.C.E., uses the press, government reform programs, and all kinds of propaganda to make them seem like the new heroes in England, while slowly they subdue the government and begin a takeover of the world. It's Ransom's job to stop them, though this time he has some followers and aid from a recently awakened power that has long slept.True to his style, Lewis makes this a very entertaining novel with a great underlying message. It is very well-written and teeming with symbolism that ultimately denounces the love of science over the love of God.This book is a great read--highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fo My Friend Brian.","review":"I bought this book for my friend Brian as he is a fan of C.S. Lewis and he's very happy with the book. :^)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong writing","review":"Perhaps not the BEST of C. S. Lewis' works, but a good one nonetheless. I was introduced to the 'space trilogy' as a teenager by my father, a minister. He thought I would enjoy the SciFi aspect and maybe glean some ethical education in the meantime. He was correct. This was not the most fun of the trilogy to read, but a good ending to the trilogy. If you are looking for classic SciFi with good moral values, the 'space trilogy' is definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I adore C.S. Lewis so much... so it pains me to say that I really, really disliked this book. The first time I attempted reading it, I got 90-something pages in, and then stopped. On my second attempt, I made it all the way through the 382 pages in about three weeks' time (that is a LONG time for me). For one, it was just boring. All of the fantastic imagination and vivid imagery from the first two books was non-existent in That Hideous Strength. It was like watching black-and-white TV. Secondly, I cared nothing for any of the characters. Not even Ransom. They were all dull and very wordy without saying much of anything at all. It was also quite a bit darker than the other two books, and many of the antagonists met gruesome ends. The allegory/theology/philosophy was also very difficult to follow. Of course I got the picture of the battle of good and evil, but as to the specifics, I don't have a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"I am a huge fan of most of C.S. Lewis' work. I had to force myself to finish this one. His view of life (esp in regard to the main female character) was SO offensive and sexist, I threw the book across the room several times. I wish I had never read it so I did not know how far his views on women and there place went. I guess according to him the largest sin of a women is to be independent and get a job. Give me a break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move Over, Huxley and Orwell.","review":"Lewis' apocolyptic vision of where mankind is headed hits far closer to the mark than the more widely read visions such as Brave New World and 1984. This is because Lewis recognizes that the evil lies not in technology or even politics but in the human heart.Lewis also shows a deeper understanding of how society functions -- as an investigative researcher I can vouch for the accuracy of his portrayal of how nefarious organizations manipulate the press, for example. He grasps what other writers never even seem to comprehend -- that it is the small choices made daily that lead down the path to Hell.As philosophy, as social commentary, or as a rolicking good story, That Hideous Strength is a compelling read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Very good ending to the space trilogy by c.s.

Love It"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite of the series","review":"This was my favorite of the three books in the sci-fi series by CS Lewis. I think it was my favorite because it was the one of the three I felt was most applicable to my walk as a Christian. It is very different from the previous two as it takes place on earth and sometime in the distant future. The atmosphere reminded me a lot of \\"1984,\\" but with an ending I felt was more consistent with my beliefs as a Christian and a bit more uplifting. There are a few lines and the stories of the main characters that have stuck with me for a long time. I strongly recommend this book to Christians or non-Christians - whether you are seeking something a bit deeper your walk with the Lord or simply an everlasting peace in this life filled with fear and uncertainty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely difficult to read","review":"This trilogy may have been good if I read and spoke the King's English. I don't and it made for a very difficult read. I didn't make it through the first book. For me, it was a waste of my money. I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Printing","review":"It seems publishers are getting very sloppy with book printing. I purchased this book, along with the other two books in C.S. Lewis' Space Trilogy and only one was printed without slanted text. I know it is only a paperback, and a $9.00 one at that, but money is being spent. I would recommend purchasing these Scribner books at a store (new or used) where you can purchase a copy that is not a defect. It defeats the purpose of a discount if the book is a defect. I believe the work of C.S. Lewis deserves better treatment. On a positive note, the cover design for this book, as well as for Perelandra and Out Of The Silent Planet, are very well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Uninteresting","review":"After reading the first five chapters I was simply too bored to continue. IMHO, a terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Try and do a Jules Verne type story. Take the fun and adventure out. Make it boring and unappealing. Voila. You have C.S.

So if this information was what you were looking for, you've found the only review that specifically tells you that all the episodes are pixel edited just as on television, so no, you're not gonna see any boobs, dicks, ass or snatch. If that's what you were wondering, wonder no more. Does this mean in a few years we might see ANOTHER full set of discs unedited? I suppose it's possible that at some point in the future, they'll offer the full, un-pixilated versions, but this fact should NOT stop you from buying this set. It's great if you can live with the pixel editing. It's the same on all Season releases.

Like watching a typical sitcom, not an Office episode at all. Full of slapstack masquerading as humor. Unrecognizable as an Office episode, since the series - indeed even the previous episode, Season 5's finale - was known for understated humor. I do not understand how the \\"parkour\\" introduction could have made it onto the screen, it's the most ham-handed, unfunny, puerile introduction in any Office episode.The writers seem to have lost the thread, here. They don't seem interested in the characters or in trying to find humor in daily activities. Presumably, this signals the end of the series as containing anything worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly below average episode","review":"I've watched this episode a couple of times and there a few truly funny scenes.

As others have noted, the Blu-ray edition has issues (in all 4 of my players) which cause the disc(s) to hiccup and freeze (my problems started with Disc 1, Episode 4, at which point I swapped them for the DVD edition).

We had an excellent season 2 and 3 to build on and some moments in the hour-long eps of season 4. But since then, you can sense a dramatic loss in the writing direction of this show. They seem to be headed towards the \\"Fonzi-jumps-the-shark\\" moment within the next three seasons (current one included). Seeing it that Carrell has next season under contract, I can imagine next season being their last or second to last unless things change. \\"Murder She Wrote\\" was yet another ep that had some entertaining moments but there were also way too many others that simply didn't hold up against the original DNA of this show. The characters are ALL a former shell of themselves - the early seasons held so much meat to each person."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is when it went down hill?","review":"I can't believe all the reviews that say this is when the show went down hill. Let's face it, the show has been going down since season 3. Season 2 was outstanding - some of the best writing episodes of any TV series. Season 3 built on the stories and added one great new character (Ed Helms is about the only person people don't complain about in their reviews)...but then season 4 and 5 is where the series started to get weaker. For those giving this season 2 stars (which is also what I gave it), I can't imagine you thinking season 5 was a \\"5 star\\" year - maybe 3 stars? My wife loved the show - that was the only reason we purchased the last two seasons, but I have convinced her to give up on The Office and save our money for something funny (Modern Family?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The show went way downhill.

I would not recommend buying this unless you truly love the show, which I do. I own all 6 seasons. It is simply my favorite show on TV.

For me this was definitely a good purchase overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, as always","review":"Great picture quality for an HD TV.

BRING BACK HOLLY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Lame","review":"The Office seasons one through five are very good. Season six was awful and even painful to watch at times. The actors are still fine, but the writing stinks. Evidently they've run out of ideas. It's no wonder Steve Carell has left the show. In season 6 Ryan (an interesting character) was used very little and they've got him back in a relationship with Kelly (doesn't work and isn't funny). Instead, they used Oscar quite a lot -- he's one dimensional and it adds nothing to the show. The idea for The Office was great (buy the original BBC version -- it's the best). For anyone who's worked in an office setting you know there are an unlimited \\"strange but true\\" situations that could be explored in the show and would be hilarious. Unfortunately, the writers of The Office must have run out of steam. I paid $14.99 on Amazon for season 6 and it was $14 too much. Tip: End your collection at season 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Program was great--packaging was awful","review":"This program was hilarious and I highly recommend it.The packaging was awful.

The writers just didn't know what to do with these characters. They would start a large story and completely forget about it an episode later. The comedy (if you want to call it that) is so in-your-face, it's pathetic. Here's an example of the kind of jokes that's littered throughout the season. You see Kevin cry like a baby into Pam's chest, and then cut to Kevin's talking head explaining that whenever a woman hears a baby's cry, their boobs get bigger.I do not suggest this season to anyone, for me, the show jumped the shark with Stress Releif. THe only reason why I gave this 2 stars, is because of the fantastic christmas episode. Strangely enough, it's one of the only shining stars in this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still better than most TV out there.","review":"While the 6th season of The Office isn't its best by any means, i'm still hard pressed to give it a bad rating. There are definitely some lackluster episodes, the season finale, by far, was a big disappointment (however i'll still take a poor Office episode over some crappy reality show, any day). Yet there are still some gems sprinkled throughout, and that's why i keep watching. Because it's safe to say that when The Office is good, absolutely nothing else compares.Standouts include:NiagaraMurderThe PromotionThe DeliveryThe LoverSecret SantaThe poorest episodes mainly include all those that focus on the ridiculous Sabre plot line.

This season was the beginning of the end. The Office (I don't even know if it's still on anymore) is a shell of what it once was and thankfully is being put to bed, albeit too late.After one of the GREATEST seasons ever in Season 5, the show takes a serious nose dive. Pam is more annoying than ever as snarky salesperson Mom Pam. Andy has too big of a role, and Aaron (though a cute character) has a poor dynamic with the forced Andy wannabe Jim-Pam type romance. Dwight is under used. Creed and Ryan have all but disappeared. Gabe is AWFUL as is the entire Sabre deal. The unnecessary focus on Oscar with the non gay warehouse guy is reaching and also done poorly.There were some great episodes here, \\"Scott's Tots\\", \\"Murder\\" and a few other moments.

Trying to get the discs out to play is very very difficult, not impossinle, but do it enough times your going to scratch the discs.

Shame on Amazon and the BBC. $94 is too much to pay for lousy video quality. The sound is intelligible but suffers from bursts of noise at times.

He admits in the book's introduction that the title should have been \\"Western European Civilization from the Fall of Rome to Present\\" not generic \\"Civilization\\". Chinese, Spanish, Indian, et al. contributions are missing as well as e.g. the impact of Palladian architecture. That was beyond budget, time and politics.

You really have to pay attention while you read the book because they give clues all the way through it. There is a twist at the end that is totally unexpected. I had to re-read the last few chapters to make sure I read it right.The story is told from Jack Trainor's point of view. Jack is a psychiatrist, and has a younger sister Kate. Kate is a writer, but she seems extremely unstable. The focus of the story is Jack's differing relationships with women. By the end of the story, there is a resolution in both Kate's relationships with men through the resolution of Jack's relationship with women. All this resolution comes because Jack faces the truth of the horrible event that framed their youth.I would highly recommend this book.

The biggest problem I had is that after an hour, only ONE appearance by the gigantic king-size snake occurs! The rest of that time is occupied with crappy and irrelevant dialogue mainly involving pointless chit chat between members of the police department. When I say pointless I really mean it- you won't care about anything they have to say at *all*, I promise. At least the last 30 minutes are saved thanks to the killer snake slithering through an underground facility, chasing teens and killing them one by one. This is the reason the movie gets 2 stars out of me. Everything else about the movie is forgettable, boring and excessively dialogue-heavy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Snake. Actors With a Name.

The special effects in some scenes were decent, but they didn't mesh so well spliced next to the old-school special effects. The opening scene is promising, and the first twenty minutes of the film isn't all that bad either. However, after that the film quickly falls apart.

Mindless entertainment with just a few glimmers of originality, but no taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why do movie companies waste their time and mine making movies this dumb? A snake with ears? Snakes can't hear sounds in the air. They have to have their head pressed against the ground to \\"hear,\\" and this only allows them to pick up ground vibrations. The python in this movie hears the characters when they are running around. The story is dumb (the author obviously doesn't know as much as he thinks he does about snakes.

First, the supposed lead actor is only in the film for about 20 mins and is killed. He is supposedly a top agent but fails in combat skills. Second, all the actors were misplaced and horrible. Third, I didn't get one thrill or even a scare from the site of this fake CGI snake. Fourth, the cliche of the monster vs. man reminded one of a failure 50's film that flunked on all scales.

I have to know, just to restore some of McCarthy's character's well-earned dignity.But wait... here comes Robert Englund of \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" fame! Surely HE will make this movie worth watching! Unfortunately, after countless scenes of stroking the python's fragile ego, he wanders off to get killed somehow. (A disappointment, really.

The special effects ain't that bad for a direct-to-video but the bad acting and some events that make little or no sense makes it hard to enjoy for me. EX: The python was able to chase down a motor vehicle but for some reason it could not catch up with two bikes or simply chose to give up the chase its beyond my understanding. Maybe my expectations for this movie were to high after having watched the sequel wich was not a masterpiece but I personally liked better due to the fact that the snakes look slightly more real and the military had a bigger role in it in a better setting in my opinion. I just tought it was going to be more similar to its sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is a true B movie","review":"Yes, some of the acting is bad. Yes, the story isn't that plausible. Yes, the special effects should have been better. But, hey this is a B movie. I gave it 4 stars because of Casper Van Dien being in the movie. I do like to see him in movies but I was a little disappointed because he didn't even have his shirt off.

Casper van Dien continues to prove he's the worst actor in some time; Robert Englund looks embarrassed; and only Jenny McCarthy adds some zest with her sexual manuevering as a potential house buyer.

There are words that perectly describe this movie but they don't exist yet unfortunately. The plot is stupid and doesn't really revolve much around the snake. The snake itself is a ripoff and doesn't provide a an uplift to this sad sacked movie. The python's size is constantly misjudged and shown on the screen. Did anybody read the script before signing on to this one. The gore has edgey attitude but turns out to be mostly average.

What is most interesting is the way in which Auchincloss builds his main character through the words of others. This technique, surprisingly, gives us a full portrait of the man and his times.

It is a wonderful collection, and also important, because it really questions that stubborn myth known as \\"the American dream\\", and it does so without putting down the people who still believe in that myth, against all possible odds. The Fortlowe stories are far richer than the Rawlins books, especially because the main character is so complicated, and because Mosley never lets him take the obvious way out of any situation. Highly recommended to anyone not afraid of books with attitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"Before I read this book, I would never have known that I could fall in love with a character who is a violent ex-convict. Socrates Fortlow, two-time murderer and one-time rapist (at least the crimes of which he has been convicted) has spent most of his life learning to survive behind bars.However, eight years after his release from the Indiana State Penitentiary, and his relocation to South Central L.A., he has become much more like his namesake. This collection of interrelated short stories together form a remarkable tale of subtle, and perhaps even unconscious, redemption. Socrates becomes a mentor, best friend, and invaluable member of society. In addition, he learns that not all is black and white, whether it be with regard to morality, or as between the races.The stories and their moral teachings are subtle, like well-crafted fables. I read this in one evening, unable to put down this wonderfully written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Didn't know of Walter Mosely until I read this book that was required by one of my English instructors.

When we reviewed Walter Mosley's book \\"A Little Yellow Dog\\", we complained that it was miscaninthropic. In Mosley's latest book, \\"Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned\\", a collection of generally quite good short stories about an ex-con named Socrates Fortlow, Mosley displays an improved attitude towards canines. In a story entitled \\"Black Dog\\", Fortlow rescues a large black dog who was run over by a car. Fortlow also punches out the driver who committed the atrocious act. Now that dogs have moved from the status of evil nemesis to victims in need of rescue from benevolent humans in Mosley's writing, perhaps in the future Mosley will portray us in a positive light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book...4 1/2 stars..Mosley is great.","review":"Walter Mosley goes beyond Easy Rawlins with Socrates Fortlow an ex-offender, almost streetperson trying to make it in Watts. You can see and feel the anger of Socrates when people sometimes carelessly, sometimes callously disregard and disrespect him because he's old, poor, Black and sometimes just a little crazy. This series of stories made me rethink my own responses to the so called streetpeople I've worked with in a professional capacity with care and understanding of their feelings but calculatingly avoided otherwise. Socrates had his own moral code, his own sense of justice and though he didn't see himself as such, he was a good man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Projects Fighters","review":"An excellent in depth review of the British Aviation industry from 1950 to 1990.

Luke is a perfect for Annie, they go together like two doves. When they're forced to be seperated by the car crash that takes Annie off to Farthingagle Manor, you feel them longing for eachother.

The highlight of the disc for me was Night Ride and Sunrise, given a emotionally powerful and communicative performance that leaves one wondering why it is not better known.

It works fine in all of my cameras - Canon S45, Olympus 5060, and my Nikon 4500. I've only had it for a month, but I haven't had any issues. I've taken approx 300+ pics on it. Note - I only see the speed difference in the Canon and the Oly when I use RAW or have the camera set on high-speed continuous shooting mode (It actually saves me 9 seconds vs a regular Sandisk card on my Canon).

Also, this is the worst Bellman interpretation I have ever heard. Although Martin Best sings in English, it is hard to understand what he is singing and the style he choose to use was baroque or borderline opera. Too bad Martin didn't do more research, he might have found out that Bellman wrote and sang for the lesser fortunate. Tavern goers, alcoholics, prostitutes etc. a more vulgar, raw and direct style, in complete contrast to Martin's own style which if you ask me, sounds more like an Germanic English blend. I would have given this a zero star rating if it would have been possible.I am waiting for Caiman (seller) to respond. I do not hold them responsible for the fact that the album reeks though I must say that I never would have ordered the album knowing it to be sung in English."},{"rating":"2","title":"richard review","review":"this vhs tape was very good i bout it for my dad who is 82 now and he loves the voice of charlotte church iwould advise any body who likes this music to buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great talent, great music and a huge disappointment","review":"This is a benchmark for how NOT to record sound tracks.You buy Charlotte's recordings to hear her truely amazing voice and you have such high hopes that her voice will be recorded in a way that shows some respect for her incredible talent.Then you play her latest DVD and your heart sinks.Charlotte's previous Voice of An Angel DVD (not the CD) is recorded so well that you can't turn it off. On the other hand, this DVD's voice track is recorded so poorly that it just makes you sick. I'll put mine in the stack of stuff to trade.Her singing sounds as if she's in an other room. Her speaking voice during the narrations however, sounds crystal clear so you know that the recording technicians are robbing you of the chance to hear this truely great singing talent.

She provides no more than sterile renditions of religious favorites, while going from place to place with her as the focal point of attention. I would have been much more pleased with her providing a narration of a video of these lands; while being out of sight and refraining from singing.

Church's carreer in awe ever since it began with her talent show appearence when she was twelve. She was a pretty good singer then--not the best--but--pretty good! Now, with every new CD and DVD Miss. Church's wobble, voice control and breath support have really gone downhill. I noticed the wobble on the \\"Voice of an Angel\\" DVD but let it slide--knowing she had just turned thirteen, so I said to myself \\"Okay, so she's got a wobble but I am sure she will fix it\\" and gosh, was I wrong! On each new DVD she brings out her technique and tone all get a little worse. However, if you are not disturbed by a voice being pushed and do not care about technique and are a fan of Charlotte Church then you should buy this. If you can't stand hearing a young, pushed voice then I would not say that you get this DVD and thats just the bitter truth."},{"rating":"2","title":"complete?","review":"How can Chandos clain this to be a complete orchestral collection when they leave out his ballet, <Le Loup>.

She deals with racism in the small town that she lives in, majority of which who are Caucasian. From her feelings of not belonging, she goes on a journey to learn more about her Vietnamese roots. Throughout the book, the main character, Mai, is trying to learn about her past involving the mother she never knew. The book is written in a simple and personal way to where you feel close to the characters. With the author's simplistic style of writing, I believe that many young people can easily understand and get enjoyment out of it. I like the way that the author slowly revealed the secrets of Mai's past because it made me want to keep reading to find out the whole story.

He is noticed by an older convict, Earl Copen, who decides to protect him. Good prison movie with excellent actors: Willem Dafoe, Edward Furlong and an hardly recognizable Mickey Rourke as Jan the transvestite. The most interesting theme of the film is the strange friendship growing between Dafoe and Furlong, not sexual but rather paternal and protective. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality prison movie...","review":"A compelling film simply because in essence it is the love story of two convicts...Willem Dafoe is both brutal and gentle as a prison lord who befriends the young and naive Ed Furlong. Throughout the movie, I was silent with fear...Bravo Buscemi for creating such a raw and human prison film without gratuitous violence and sex. In fact, more violence would've ruined the intensity of the film as a whole. And thank god for the few moments of comic relief&#65533;some of the only chances a viewer gets to release some of the pent up tension carried throughout the film.

The cans need to have a few more degrees of movement for them to fit properly, as it is the tops of the pads pinch the tops of my ears, and the bottom edges don't even come into contact.Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend these to anyone else without at least test fitting a pair, and even then I'd have reservations because other headphones don't have this kind of fitment issue.

Screen reflects too much outside light obfuscating the LED numbers. The numbers have low contrast and their improvement is not achieved by the technique suggested to where they can be easily seen.

Unfortunately, this game is very poorly designed and manages to ruin the fun of Sodoku. The game has several problems:1. The screen is the worst ever! You can't see the numbers except at a certain angle, and the back lighting doesn't really work. This game will strain your eyes and give you a massive head ache.2. The stylus that comes with the game doesn't seem to work that well. I used a pen and that worked better.3. The game offers no way to check a certain square. The only error check offered is for the entire board, meaning if you make a mistake but don't want to reveal all the squares, you are out of luck.4. No way to notate squares. You cannot put a note for possible remaining numbers for any square. This makes solving tougher puzzles really frustrating.Don't buy this game. It is worthless.

Yes, it has the classic hit, headhunter on it; if you like the song, download it because buying the album wasnt worth one song. I tried and tried to enjoy the cd through and through but it was lacking and I am let down. For BPM music, its real good but is nothing more than late 80's synth music. It may have been revolutionay, it may have been ground breaking, it may have been influential-- but it is a \\"has been\\" and will stay that way in my eyes. Save your money, buying this is like buying a Lords of Acid cd; its just dated aerobic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Perspectives!!!!!!!!","review":"The best part of \\"This Present Darkness\\" is the fact that Peretti puts 3 Perspectives on it. One from humans, one from angels, and one from the demonic forces. Then, just to put you in awe, he writes a story in the middle that overshadows some of the best secular writers in the entire world. Frank's the man, and he's being used of God. -Gregory"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have any spare time, read This Present Darkness.","review":"This Present Darkness was very good book. The story was so welll written that I could not put it down. Every free second I got I would use it to read this book. This book was put together very well. It wasn't one those books that every other word you word come to one would have to look it up. It was very easy to follow. He was so descriptive of some of the characters in this book (angels and evil spirits) that I could literally picture the characters in my head. I would recommend thid book to many."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting \\"can't wait to turn the page\\" kind of book.","review":"How anybody finishes this book and can still follow the occult is beyond me. Christians know the value of prayer but this book will only enhance that in your mind. Great reading....."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that truly changed my life.","review":"I have met people who read only non-fiction and can't understand how a fictitious book could make a lasting impression on one's life. If you want to know, just read the book. It will change the way you see things, and will start a growth process in your spirit that you may not recognize at first. And, let me add that this book is so entertaining that I couldn't put it down. It really is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Battle belongs to the Lord!!!","review":"Awesome reading. The author's graphic depiction of spiritual warfare is wonderful. The description really helps one visualize the struggle. Whether this is how it is or not, spiritual warfare is real, I've seen it and fought it. Ephesians 6:12 is how it is. Since the battle has been won, it's simply a matter of choosing sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad source to develop theology on spiritual warfare.","review":"Very entertaining writing. Very bad source for determining a biblical understanding of spiritual warfare. Case in point, the role of the Holy Spirit is non-existant in the book and yet without the Holy Spirit in our lives we have no \\"teacher, comforter, counsellor or guide\\". The gifts of the Holy Spirit are absent as well, which requires the ability of the believer or assistance of ministering spirits to accomplish God's work. Stick to scripture for proper understanding of how God works and the Christian response to Him"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!!!!!","review":"Very well written. The characters are vivid and thought provoking. The storyline is fast paced, action packed and based on truths that anyone can read in ANY bible. Must have stuck a nerve with someone out there to obtain a response from an educator or educator's?? Interesting how the hit dog hollers the loudest. Great book would like a third one with the same characters. Should be a movie I'd pay good money to see this on the silver screen. Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous example of the need for passionate prayer","review":"Like so many other reviewers, I found this book hard to put down. The concept of spritual warfare is a difficult one for most of us, and this work provides a unique perspective, a story about 'real-life' in middle-America, and how Satan works to destroy all things good. I found it a real encouragement to my prayer life. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Present Darkness","review":"The book was incredible. It really puts things in perspective. So often we lose sight of the little things in life that can lead us astray. This book helps to remind us all of how we should act and how others should preceive us as Christians. Thank you for selling this book and at a reasonable price. I borrowed this book from my boyfriends mother and had to buy a copy for myself to share with others. I hope many more people will find this book as inspiring as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Original","review":"With this book, Peretti has shown himself to be one of the very few authors able to write a satisfying Christian thriller. Breaking into the fascinating realm of the supernatural, Peretti gives us a breathless view of the daily war waged between angels and demons.Where this novel fails is in its stereotypical view of angels and demons. While most Christians believe demons are fallen angels who have teamed up with Satan, Peretti makes the angels seem almost human while the demons seem more like dark, dirty renditions of the slimy green ghost in the hotel in \\"GhostBusters\\". And the demons seem woefully inferior to the angels.Still, those moments are few, and Peretti's deft writing (which does get a little bogged down in the middle) keeps the action moving and doesn't allow such low-points to have much affect on the flow of the story. Highly recommended if for no other reason than as a prelude for the second book which is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening! ! ! !","review":"I was given this book by someone who knew of my search for spiritual answers to the mysteries of the world in which I live. . . This book is awesome! ! ! It started me on a quest for identifying and utilizing God-given powers to make changes in situations that appear to be untenable. That's just what I got out of it. Buy the book - read it - then find your own truth. . . The book is a fun ride - from start to finish. . . I found myself caring about the characters, liking some, loving some, disliking others and having a personal preference for what needed to happen to others. Read the book - you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting.....but","review":"After reading the book and reading the other reviews, I found it quit commical that people take reading so seriously. Yes, it was trilling, Yes, it isn't writing on the same plane as Charles Dickens, and Yes, it falls short of conforming to exact biblical specifications that everyone thinks it should have. So what. The book was obviuosly written to entertain not to alter the state of the universe. So just relax,enjoy, and you'll make it through......and maybe even learn something."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book for anyone with ?'s about spiritual warfare","review":"This book lays out the facts about spiritual warfare. The first chapter or two is a little slow, but after that get ready for your socks to get blown off! Peretti gives vivid details of how real live angels and demons use their spiritual forces against each other. This book will definitely bring you closer to God and will make you more aware of the battles of spiritual warfare. A great book for missionaries and ministry students!!! Get it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL !!!!","review":"This book was really great. The battle between good and evil and the power of prayer were really brought out. It pointed out the evil subtlety of Satan and his demons. I encourage everyone to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Present Darkness","review":"\\"This Present Darkness\\" gives a vital \\"where the rubber meets the road\\" grip of the reality of spiritual warfare and the incredible power of prayer. A \\"must read\\" for pre-teens and teens getting slammed with the pressures to compromise moral standards and pressures to embrace the New Age philosophies. Not only does it expose the deceit of evil, but lays out an example of how it can be combated through prayer - yes, even at age 12! I first read this book about 20 years ago, and it seems more relevant today (after re-reading it with my son), than it did the first time I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":":(","review":"I didn't like the sound effects. It took away from the the story. I've read This Present Darkness and Loved It...but not the audiobook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intriguing content, crummy fiction","review":"Some have described Peretti's writing as a cross between C.S. Lewis and Stephen King. Maybe so, but he's not nearly as good a writer as either of them. I can't recommend wasting time with this as the fiction was poor quality. Instead, read Lewis's \\"Screwtape Letters\\"The Screwtape Letters: How a Senior Devil Instructs a Junior Devil in the Art of Temptationfor a much better-written story detailing below-the-surface spiritual warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"On","review":"One of the finest books I have ever read, a must read for anyone who wants to know more about the \\"Real World\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This present darkness","review":"I ran into this book many years ago and being a very Holy GHost, spiritual person it would seem to me to be the type of book that a Christian person like me; you would turn tale and run. Quite the contraree! We live in the Spirit world today and I say that in all sincerety. This book lets you feel like you are into this world, because it is a fiction trying to break the news of the things that will truly be happening."},{"rating":"2","title":"In awe","review":"I have read this book several times. I can't get enough. Great job Peretti! I have read all of Peretti\`s books and they are all powerful however, This Present Darkness and Piercing The Darkness are my favorites. Definitely worth five stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"I read the Book","review":"Now I want to here it on tape in full. I loved the book and am looking forward to its dramatic reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Congratulations Mr. Peretti!!","review":"I am Ivete of Brasil, I don't speak English. I love your 2 books, fantastic!! Excuse me the English, i know very few, but i say you is wanderful, great, very, very inteligent, Happy new year!!! To you end your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"The power of prayer revealed at last!","review":"Ashton could be any town, anywhere, but this is where angels and demons battle for the destiny of men. The story is so well written, with twists and turns that things are not always as they seem. A fictional account of spiritual warfare that I would like to believe is true. This book will change your view on prayer forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly metaphorical and slurs non-Christian religions","review":"Hypes Christianity with an overly-metaphorical 'spiritual' war that can only be resolved through intense prayer. Characters were stereotypical (the good priest; the 'ignores his family' working man; the 'young, good-looking' female reporter; etc.), and women earned their existence by being attractive, good wives, or witches. Treated all non-Christian religions (e.g., Muslim faith; anything new-age; etc.) as demonic. Writing was cliche-ish with overly dramatic swirls. I was hoping for a religious allegory or critique a la C.S. Lewis or James Morrow, but Peretti falls short."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fast read, fortunately.","review":"This book is to literature what McDonald's is to haute cuisine; it goes a long way in showing how fundamentalists are blazing new paths in the 'dumbing-down' phenomena so prevalent in our culture. Was it written for 6th graders? Its cream-puff triteness and juvenile character development makes one wonder how it could have come from the same planet once graced by Sophocles and Dostoevsky. Even its theology is questionable. For Peretti, human evil seems not to be something inherent in human nature but rather a residual product of some cosmic spiritual struggle looming invisibly over everyone's heads. It amazes me how fundamentalists are so ignorant of the theological and cosmological implications of the biblical narratives they so militantly claim to be taken literally (e.g., the fall of man into sin.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It scares me to think that there is such lack of tolerance!","review":"First let me tell you that I would not even give this book a one star but it is required so I gave the lowest rating allowed. Each person is out looking for what will lead them to a better life. While looking over the book I found a message of hate and lack of tolerance. This book is a book written from the heart of one who seems to have the very termoil in his heart and wants to have the rest of the world pulled in. New Age religion is not so new, being as they clump Druids and Wiccans and the like into one group. When we go on the defensive then we teach hate which is not a value I wish to instill in my children. Each to their own and share what you like, listen if you will. But this is more of a fire and brimstone kind of approach and nothing I want anything to do with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Ignorance and scare mongering at it's worst","review":"This book shows a complete and utter ignorance of the spiritual realm. Worse still, it targets another religon, and makes it out to be evil, and the cause of all the said towns problems. Religious intolerance is the ONLY evil in this book! And I am so grateful to God that the spirit realm is none of the tripe, that this book purports. Nothing is more harmful than ignorance, except for the fear it creates. Surely the burning of innocent people at the stake, in the dark ages, by the church, should have taught us all, that religious ignorance, superstition and fear of the spiritual, only causes pain, suffering, religious wars and death! And then tell me where the real evil lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of my time","review":"I enjoied the Christian Theme of this book but it was a waste of my time. I did not appreciate the length of this book. The author spent most of his time adding MORE Characters rather than leading to the climax. I do not feel that this book streinghtened my beliefs. I am afraid that i now will judge this author's book negatively just beacuse this book was so poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the WORST i've ever read!!","review":"This book is soooo terrible! not worth reading AT all! First off, you have this image in your head of this guy and a girl... but Frank gets these people in HIS very own sdtory mixed up.... the genders you never are quite sure of since one is suppose to be a girl, but suddenly changes to \\"he says\\" \\"she says\\" crap! Frank get your chacacters sexes' straight before right a book. This was the biggest waist of time in my life to even read a sentance of any of his books! Just absolutely terrible!!!!!!!!!! Read it and waist time and money on something as pathetic as this book, you'll see what i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angelic Forces at Work","review":"An interesting concept, of which until Peretti has never been written of, to my knowledge. Many a Christian has wondered of the spiritual activity that takes place daily in heaven and earth, and whether this is a true interpretation of the events taking place in the spirit world or not, it does present itself to be very entertaining reading. Peretti's first novel, if I'm not mistaken, and by my judgement, his finest. I have read this book several times, and after each time I walk away with something I never received from it before, while still maintaining a degree of freshness, so as not to become a stale story. More than anything, I must confess that this novel makes the reader think - and I understand that that is a tired cliche at best, but I must strongly contest that it is in fact the case here. Prepare to be stimulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite novel of all time","review":"This book is captivating, brilliant, and memorable. Peretti is a master at his craft. You're not a whole person until you've read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great transaction and great book!","review":"This is a great seller; fast shipping and book in great shape. The book is awesome! This is the third book we've purchased as we've loaned out the first ones and never get them back. Everyone loves the book when they read it. It really helps you look at your everyday decisions in a new light by looking at it from a supernatural angle. Buy the book I think you'll really like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT book for Christians to read for their own enjoyment!","review":"Geewiz...it's a book to read for those who LIKE to read. I highly doubt if it's meant to \\"change the world\\" or cause an \\"apocalypic frenzy\\" (as another reader wrote). I believe it's intention is to entertain but also make one think about the depth of their OWN spiritual life. Definitely a book to make you think. It's refreshing! Read it and enjoy it for what it's worth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Bible school only","review":"Ok first before any one gets upset I am a not an atheist, attend church, and respect evalgelicals and other faiths. I give this such a low rating because I thought I was getting a novel that was fiction in the realm of the Calling or the Book Of Joby. yes, I liked these two novels I enjoy a well written good vs evil novel. This book was written with not the general audience in line but the bible thumping reader in mind. In the first chapters alone you could tell this. I bought these by quiclky skimming a review of the The Calling by David Mack {Big mistake not to happen again} where a particular reviewer said this book was much better. Luckliy I bought this and another FP novel used. When I recived them they both had bible study group info stamped in them. I still tried them anyway. I belive these are good for the bible study group but not for those looking for a wellw ritten fiction book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have not finished reading this book yet, but from what I have read so far it is an outstanding book. A friend recommended it to me after reading it and I have not been dissapointed yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story not to be taken %100 seriously","review":"What Frank set out to do, and what he occomplished is treuly wonderful. He brought the christian unseen world into a context that is understandable and enjoyable. As one other reviewer sia,d most xian literature is dreadfully dull and unredable. This, and Jim Walker's books are very readable. Some of the pheology is stretched, but I think it's done so to give the story life. I do wish some angels had been killed, and are demons ugly? Also, some of the demons asked who Tal was. They all knew each other! That whole temper tamtrem that was put in there could have been eliminated. I don't believe that newagers are trying to take over the world like he says, but it does make for a good read. If you haven't read the book do so! I think it can be appriciated by both christian and onchristian alike. Just don't think it's a perfect reflection of reality as some people appear to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"A valiant attempt at writing, but...","review":"I have a great deal of respect for Mr. Peretti's faith, and I admire what he sought to accomplish with the novel. The plot is certainly relevant. However, the characters are as thin as the paper the book is printed on, and the story is told rather clumsily. I understand that he's written much else since this novel first saw publication, so perhaps he's improved. I recommend the novel on content, but not on quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even God wouldn't like this book.","review":"The premise of this book was ridiculous, even if you're religious. I know this book was supposed to make the readers feel reverent and all that, but all I felt like doing after reading it was going to the nearest religious paraphenelia store and berating the owners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amani","review":"Happy with my buy and it was on time.I have been looking for this book for years and so happy Amazon made it easy.Great read, Thank you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of evil spirits","review":"This author takes one into the mindset of evil demons and their hidden activities.

This book is SWEEEEEET!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a classic and a great revelation.","review":"This Present Darkness is a clasic. But most important, is an important revelation of the forces that are behind the struggles of all mankind. As the author says, is not necesarilly the way it is on the book; but the evil is everywhere and the help of God is there if you just pray for it. Reading this book is one of the best time investments you can make in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Present Darkness....feel the power!","review":"This Present Darkness is the best book I have ever read having to do with realistic spiritual warfare. The vivid descriptions it presents of the angelic and demonic forces it breathtaking. I could not put it down, even after my 3d time reading it. If you have never read this book, I highly encourge you to find a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate speech disguised as a suspense novel.","review":"This is a great book if you believe that Buddhists, holistic healers and pretty much anyone other than fundamentalist Christians are in fact Satan and are trying to take over the world. I won't deny Peretti's ability to write and develop page turning suspense, but this is a book you might want to just skip over if you have an IQ of over 70. Books like this are pretty much the most acceptable form of hate speech. So keep that in mind if you find yourself intrigued by the interesting title are dark cover art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember . . . it's fiction","review":"I actually found this to be a nice entertaining book. However, in the years following my first reading of it, I have been surprised how many Christians don't seem to realize that it's fantasy, not reality.It's a cool story, on the level with Star Wars, but it's far from a \\"Christian\\" book. There is no Biblical basis for much of anything in the book--no reason to believe that demons cause our emotions, or that demons specialize in certain emotions (eg, demons of fear, depression, etc), or that our prayers give angels strength, or much of anything else in the realm that Peretti has created.So while Peretti writes some pretty good sci-fi, I give only one star because his books seem to have the effect (whether intentional or not) of turning people away from real scriptural study and making them think they have experienced a revolutionary spiritual experience by reading a fictional book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here they go again...","review":"Apparently, conservatives bash Hollywood because it doesn't make the RIGHT KIND of simple-minded junk. And guys, please tone down the \\"spiritual war\\" talk. After centuries of questionable behavior by folks marching in the name of Jesus, the rest of the world gets a little nervous when phrases like that are thrown around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful book, worse theology","review":"I am not sure if the author of this book has ever read the Bible.

She can't stand it. It's scary and very disturbing. I'm so disappointed. Next time I will definitely look deeper at the description of what I'm buying. I read the book and really liked it. She listens to books on cd as she drives. We were both very disappointed at my mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Angels and demons - closer to reality than you could believe.","review":"I read this book when Peretti first wrote it many years ago.

However, l believe this one is his best work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christian fiction!","review":"I used to love to read mystery novels, stories full of suspence and intrigue. As a Christian I wondered if there was something out there I could feel comfortable reading, when I came across this novel in my church library.It deals with the struggle between good and evil. I saw where someone lessened this struggle by insisting what was portrayed as evil simply is not, but as a Christian familiar with God's Word I assure you it is forbidden in the Bible and is in fact evil. The story may take a bit to get into, but once you do it is action packed, full of suspense! I simply did not want the story to end! This story also is carried on in Piercing The Darkness, which I highly recommend! I actually enjoyed the second novel the most.Anyway, if you are looking for Christianity's answer to Stephen King, look no more! Good writing, good story, all from the view of a Christian writer. And I would recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book!","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. It so deserves to be a movie, it's not even funny.

Those that bash this book should be scared of the demonic influences that may exist in their own lives!"},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll want everyone you know to read this book","review":"This is a great book...I read it years ago and loaned it to lots of people. The last friend I loaned it to forgot to return it...perhaps they loaned it to someone else. It's that kind of book...you'll want everyone you know to read it.

This is a reccomended book for any church library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!!!","review":"This Present Darkness is one of the best books I've ever read. As a Christian I thought I'd really never find anything interesting to read. Most fictional books are just not for me. When I started reading this I had the hardest time putting it down.

Please Mr. Peretti write more!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK EVER READ!!!","review":"I just wanted to encourage all Christians to read this book!! It is very good, and the parrelell to Christians praying and angels fighting was AWESOME!God Bless.<I>Mike Wodke</I"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary because it's real","review":"I've read a lot of Frank Peretti's books. They have all healped me to believe in God more and more. A lot of devosions seem to go right into my ear and out the other, but Peretti's books set up a thrilling, fiction setting dealing with spiritual warfare.This Present Darkness, even though one of his oldest, is his best. It kept my attention the whole time. I felt like I was watching a movie. It doesn't matter where you are in life, if you're a strong christian who shows up to church every Sunday or a lukewarm christian. This book will effect anyone. My prayers have really increased ever since I finished reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, heartwarming story! A true classic.....","review":"We purchased this book when our son (now 4 years old) was an infant. It was a big hit with him right from the beginning. Now his 18 month old sister is in love with this book. It's the first book she picks at naptime and bedtime, and she even talks about \\"Polo\\" and \\"Pinpin\\". This is a wonderful story to share with your children! I like how the author describes the different ways each of the mother animals love their children (much like humans of different religions or different ethnic backgrounds). This is definitely a book that I will keep around in hopes of sharing it with our grandchildren someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting art and warm characters spellbind young readers","review":"Althought the strength of motherlove is a common theme today in children's books, this work stands out in the hearts of children thanks to the lovable characters and warm,color-rich art.

Readers are sure to feel the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but WRONG","review":"This is a nice, cute story with one glaring problem. Penguins live in Antarctica near the South Pole...polar bears live in the Arctic near the North Pole!! This book adds to the incorrect assumption that many children AND adults have that polar bears and penguins live in the same area. The writer REALLY should have done a little research before putting this book in print. For that matter, the publisher of this book should be even more embarrassed. I understand that this is not meant to be a non-fiction, educational text. However, it would be nice to not perpetuate incorrect thinking in the readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is not just one more goopy mother-love book.","review":"By telling about love from the points of view of different animals, this book manages to be warm and comforting and at the same time stretches the imaginations of young children. The pictures are beautiful enough for a child to look at alone, but the book begs to be read aloud. It is a great bedtime book, especially when a toddler's life has been just a bit too hectic or challeging that day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog gives it 5 stars, I give it 4...","review":"This product is very handy, I can get 3 servings from a large pouch, adding it to dry kibble for my Shih Tzu.

It's very convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Goddess women","review":"Though the author tries to draw women in with references to Goddess religion and women's ways of knowing, it is truly written for the woman who hasn't yet begun her \\"Goddess journey\\" on any level in her life. As a priestess, I was very disappointed in the many references to \\"God\\" and the negation of Goddess wisdom. The author should have stuck to writing for a patriarchial audience, as matri-focal women will find little value in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is more like Menopause for 4th graders!!!!!","review":"I was so disappointed in this book.

A quarter of the way into the novel, most readers will have already guessed Lady Audley's Secret, nevertheless, the characters have to go through the process of discovering and proving the secret.There are a few things that I thought were interesting, though some might think they were dated, such as the \\"denouncement\\" scene or the \\"attempted murder\\" scene or the \\"clean-up the mess\\" sequence of events. These scenes are classic sensational Victorian episodes that you don't see anymore in today's novels. On the other hand, there are some unexpected turns that will surprise the modern readerWhen the story comes to its happy conclusion, I can't help but feel sorry for Lady Audley. Her fate just seemed a bit extreme for my taste. This is a great novel you can toss off in a couple of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodrama to the Max","review":"It's easy to see why this tale was such a page-turner when originally written, especially since - like \\"Les Miserables\\" - it was serialized in the newspapers to hook its readership. Had this been a \\"blind\\" reading in which neither the author nor the year of publication were revealed, it could likely pass as the product of Mary Higgins Clark or other modern writers of suspense. The characters are each compelling and plausible in their own way; it's unfortunate that the made-for-TV film in 2000 couldn't do such an enjoyable story justice. The only twist I would like to have seen might have been a wicked streak on the part of George to frame his duplicitous wife for his alleged murder, then reappear in an amnesiac state shortly after her hanging. As written, the ending wrapped up a tad too neatly after such a pulse-pounding ride.Christina HamlettAuthor of Eire Apparent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden Gem!","review":"I was very happy with the purchase of this book as I could not find it in stock at the two major bookstores in my area.

It's the first book I have struggled with in a while. And it's not because it's hard to read; far from it. The characters are, simply put, not interesting. I didn't care for a single one of them, not even the \\"detective\\" of the story, Robert Audley, or the \\"enchanting\\" and \\"mysterious\\" heroine herself, Lady Audley. There was some good bits of suspense, and a few bits of mystery, but because of the flat characters this really did little to compensate."},{"rating":"2","title":"an unexpected treat","review":"As an avid reader of 19th century lit, I am always on the lookout for new (and good) authors of this time period.

When I first sat down to read it, the typeface was so big I wondered if it had been written for 4th-graders. That, the skimpy length, and the worst ending of about any book I've ever read easily make this King's worst, as well as that of Hard Case Crime.King thinks he is being clever, but really he could have just put THE END on page 78 instead of page 186 and saved us all a bunch of trouble. It certainly would not have affected the story any."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was the Point?","review":"I read this long story/book in about two days, upon completion of which, I said to myself, \\"What was the point of that?\\"Not only was it not really a crime story, but it seemed more like a writing exercise for King and not a complete work. At the end [*SPOILER*], you still don't know if the dead man was murdered, what he was doing in Maine or how he got there in the first place.For all of King's explanations in the afterword, that lack of a conclusion really irks me. And apparently a lot of other readers as well by the looks of the previous reviews.

The end.\\" Gee, a mystery story with no solution! That probably isn't tried more than a hundred times a year by unpublished authors, to be met with form letter rejection every time (wouldn't Form Letter Rejects be a great name for a band?).Written so quickly that King places a Starbucks in 1980 Denver, and since publishers have been too embarassed to edit Mr. King for well over a decade, it stayed in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Time","review":"King wrote this story as a vehicle to say that some mysteries have no conclusion. Fine, but those are the ones that don't become novels. The result is simply the impression that King copped out and just rambled on without knowing how to end this thing.The three characters are ok but can't contend with the pointless ending.Be warned, read the description and understand that the question asked on the cover does have an answer and that answer is NO."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 180 page conversation about a mystery with no solution","review":"First of all, I've read 10 books in the Hard Case Crime series and loved all of them except this one. I have also read all of Stephen King's novels up through \\"Misery\\". This is by far his worst book, judging by the ones I've read, and the worst entry in this series. If you're reading the Hard Case Crime series you might want to read this one to complete it, but it's a disappointment. Hope I'm not giving too much away, but the entire book is one conversation between three people about a mystery - if there had at least been a solution to the mystery at the end that would have been something. The mystery is uninteresting as it is - even more so without an answer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Colorado Kid","review":"This charming short story by Stephen King is slowly revealed by two old and seasoned reporters to their young, new partner.

I guess that King was trying to experiment with this book, so I will give him 2 stars for effort. However, the experiment didn't work.

I'm not sure how--the series isn't over yet, so I'm assuming that the case that somehow involves Audrey's mom is the Colorado Kid story, but that's the only connection I've found between the book and the television show.The book comes across as amateurish--definitely not the style readers have come to expect from Stephen King. I was hooked through most of it too, because it is quite interesting and kept me guessing as to what had happened. But then...no delivery. The reader is never given the conclusion and wrap-up. I know that is how the author wanted it, but I am all about closure and can't stand open-ended interpretation.

At the end of the mystery, the detectives are still as baffled as when they started. There are enough unsolved mysteries in real life, we don't need fictional ones.

Stephen King is a very talented writer and that talent is minimally displayed in this book, although I have given it only 2 stars.King fails in his most important job of character development. All three of the main characters are immediately forgettable. I think King could have done better with developing his characters. Also, the trivial twists and turns are painfully dull.Reading the book is like listening to a long joke where at the end, it is not even funny and you feel as if you had been cheated out of the time you spent listening.However, if you are looking for 2 hours to kill (yes, I am a slow reader, so you can easily complete this book in two hours), the book maybe better than watching TV.Plot:Two Veteran Newspaper publishers in a sleepy town on the Maine coast tell a story of the most baffling death they had every investigated to one of their new promising reporters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Yawn--Is King Even Trying Here?","review":"No Grit...No Teeth...No Real Mystery...

It wasn't \\"Hard\\" when stereotypical New England duffers recount quaint and whimsically in their safe little newspaper offices the tale. And a \\"Crime\\" was never established. No danger... No peril...It was long on characterization, short on plot. And gripping plot and action is what sparks life in good mysteries--not King's folksiness. This isn't a new genre, or something ground-breaking, it seems to be exploring a self-indulgent fancy.I count The Green Mile as one of my all-time favorites, but this was a real disappointment. Hope his career doesn't end on this sad note"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're interested because of \\"Haven\\", forget it.","review":"I bought this book because the television program \\"Haven\\" is based upon it. The word \\"based\\" should be preceded by the words \\"Incredibly vaguely\\". Two characters names and occupations are about the only things in common.Then, the book itself doesn't tell a story.
