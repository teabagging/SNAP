Deleuze has brilliantly reconceived philosophy as the production of concepts and has attempted to reintroduce metaphysics back into the project of creative thinking. If accepted, this is a radical and crucial turning point in the development of contemporary philosophy-Heidegger may not have the final word on metaphysics after all. This difficult text is composed of three essential parts, concepts, science, and art. There are mordantly brilliant critiques of logic and positivism here, as well as crucial articulations of Deleuze's commitment to artistic expression. In the final analysis, it is the \`plane of immanence' that grips me most completely. The power and radicality of Deleuzian metaphysics will be felt for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"This is one of those books that everyone should own and read.

It seems that music-making became, in that phase of his career, too easy for this highly musical talented artist: the positive tension and originality faded away, in the same way as my concentration and fascination while listening.May be there exists another compilation of Hendersons work that included his finest recordings as mentioned: in that case I must recall this review and refer to the alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff to be sure, but large chunks left out","review":"I couldn't more agree with OUR THING and IN'N'OUT being glaring omissions; and then there's the chunk of material he did for Milestone Records, of which I love THE ELEMENTS (with Alice Coltrane).

I bought the Hitachi router to replaced my craftsman. I like the feel and performance of the Hitachi, however there is some drawbacks with it. First, there's no light within the bit area to help you see the work the bits doing while you are using it by hand vs mounted to a table. I had to ensure I had a lot of light while working indoors. Second, the on/off switch isn't on the handle for ease of use. The on/off switch is located at the top of the router. This makes it awkward when using this router by hand.

And I wish the speed control would have been more prominent. With all the stylin' contours on this thing its hard for your fingers to figure out where it it when its running on a router table.To any router noobs out there - buy this model - not the single speed.

This CD came out at a very formitive point in my life and has helped me recover from a surgury or two. The music contained herein is magical. Gary's not preoccupied by beating you over the head with riff after riff. He's able to convey real emotion and pathos out of each song. There are quite a few homages to other guitar players works on this disk. But, Gary is able to maintain his style throught each song. Other players like Vai and Satch seem to favor more of a style over substance approach. Don't get me wrong, they are both great players. Gary's work seems less like a guitar playing exercise and more like a spiritual convergence. Brilliant album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who needs words?!","review":"This is an epic movie for those of you who have not seen it. If you have, then you know the soundtrack is top of the line. Gary Hoey does a fantastic job of mixing and mashing his guitar to fit the mood for the scenary in the movie. There aren't any lyrics but there doesn't have to be. The best tracks on the album are probably The Deep, Blast and Pipe.This is one soundtrack you will not regret buying, what are you waiting for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gary Hoey- Endless Summer II","review":"Can't miss with Hoey.

It's a great CD and I have played it many times over. You have to ignore the reviews that bash it because they are trying to compare the music to Led Zeppelin. Of course it sounds like Led Zeppelin. That's where the influence comes from. Is the music as good as Led Zeppelin? Of course not. But it is awesome music from a band that rocked. My big hang up with this new remastered release is the poor packaging. They didn't only screw up the track order but they were sloppy about sticking with all capital letters versus mixed case track titles. The rest of the packaging is about as bland as can be. There are no album credits or liner notes anywhere. Doesn't even list the members of the band anywhere or say who produced it. Looks like I will be keeping my original copy and trading in this new unprofessionally packaged remaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Disc","review":"Great disc.Love the lead singer.He sounds like a cross of Robert Plant and Billy Squire !

Her words feel like they are reaching down inside of you and bringing out all of the emotions you have. Listening to her CD has been very theraputic for me at times.

I have many Lodge pieces including two dutch ovens, BBQ, many pans, grills. But this item, was so poorly made the screen even wobbles where the handle is attached. Washing is not joy either because the water gets inside the tubes holding the mesh just from running hot water over the screen to brush off oil. The glue attaching the screen is messy and is well outside where it should be. Overall, the cheap products I have seen in the grocery store for $6 are better quality than this. I guess this is what happens when a great company like Lodge decides to start making their products in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"This thing is very flimsy at the point where the handle connects to the circle containing the screen.

Turns out, she loves it. It is one of her very favorites and we read it regularly. (She now points out in the kitchen which fruit has a \\"hard wrinkled PIT.\\") I think the wording and crystal clear pictures on a white background grab her attention, and she really loves the plastic see-through pages that you flip over to show the inside of the fruit. Plus, she has actually learned a lot about a healthy food group, understands to avoid eating fruit seeds, and is branching out her vocabulary at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Sample","review":"Many people, myself included, like Joe Sample's output with the Jazz Crusaders and the Crusaders. A lot of this music could be described as soul jazz. Much of his other work seems to be more in the genre of smooth jazz. On this release, Sample seems to be returning to the soul jazz fold although it could be better described as funk. So much for definitions. The title of this release is apt, as much of the music on this CD is drenched in a soulful feeling.Like some of the other reviewers, I can't say that all of the tracks hold up equally. Nevertheless, tracks such as Brother Can You Spare Your Car, Did You Feel That? and Viva de Funk are really moving and played exceptionally well by some fine musicians. You can't go wrong when Steve Gadd plays drums. As funk goes, this is superior music because the musicians make the difference. For those interested in this type of music, this CD is worth investigating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Developing .NET Custom Controls","review":"This book is full of typos and is not well structured. In the few chapters which were well written, I usually found that the material in the chapter merely whetted my appetite for more actual details (as opposed to more enumeration of properties and methods).On the other hand, I haven't seen _any_ other book attempt to tackle advanced design-time issues like this book does, and it's nice to see the similarities between Windows Forms and Web Forms designers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good subject, very bad book.","review":"This has to be the worst book I have ever bought.

It sounds like the soundtrack to some cool car chase film, and a convertible or a speed boat must be the most appropiate place for its listening. Its funky consistency will put anybody in a good mood. The organ, drums and guitar are outstanding throughout, these guys really dominate their instruments. The only bad thing (if it can be considered a bad thing) is that the wah-wah is used the whole time, and this may lead some people to find the songs a bit repetitive. However, I believe JTQ have a really cool and funky sound, and in my opinion this album is their best together with Money Spider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading for US Citizens","review":"Mr. Chomsky, the writer of our times, takes foreign policy and interprets it into something that is understandable.

Whenever I want to read something that makes me dislike America, I can count on Noam. His failure to be honest in this book is apparent from about page 5 onward. His positive reviews are pretty much canned and produced by the Jim Jones style followers he courts on college campuses. I give this book only 2 stars. One star because he uses a few big words and another star because in actually writing a book and marketing it, he is contributing to capitalism. Other than that, his rhetoric is tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chomsky -- remixed!!!","review":"It must be a source of constant frustration to Noam Chomsky that he must reside and eke out a living in an undemocratic \\"failed\\" state. Perhaps this is his rejoinder to those who would accuse him of voting with his feet.Appeals to the U.N. Charter, international law, and the sanctity of sovereign states make their appearance -- again. With the possible exception of Margret and H.A. Rey, nobody is better at repackaging the same themes over and over again with only new cover art and title.Chomsky is correct, in that the strict respect for the sovereignty of states provides the best path to ending international war. Yes, we get it. As for the wars sovereign states wage internally on their own citizens (e.g., Sudan, North Korea, Rwanda, Burma, Nazi Germany), Chomsky's solution is to change the subject. A wagging finger pointed back at the U.S. is the universal gesture for doing nothing, when real suffering is at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"A must read for those interested in survival: for themselves, their families and the brotherhood of man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who tells the truth?","review":"Noam Chomsky describes two diagramtically opposed faces of his own country; one relating to what its government does and another relating to what his fellow citizens know. In between there is a compliant press that is not good at being impartial. The government of the USA seems to be an oligarchy that leans to the far right and less far right alternately, and the press seems to be its propaganda machine. I am not a communist, not even a socialist. I merely belive in an intrinsic dignity of humanity that needs to be more assertive. While he may not have all the answers, Noam Chomsky helps us ask more questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent analysis on the current events involving United States","review":"Another great book written by the Professor Chomsky.

The author's fiction and poetry, which he quotes from ad nauseum, is mediocre, his prose turgid. The concept of this book, a book that discusses dialogue through dialogue is annoying and rambling. I read half-way through and gave up. The book imparted absolutely no practical advice and its theory was mere horse-sense, banal beyond belief. Why this book has gone through a re-release is beyond me. It should perish among remainders. See Sol Stein, who in a single chapter does more than Turco could dream of, or see the excellent \\"Writing Dialogue for Scripts\\" by Rib Davis for a real book on dialogue. This book is a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled - SAME book as \\"Dialogue\\"","review":"This is the SAME book titled \\"Dialogue\\" that was published by Writers Digest Books. Read the reviews for \\"Dialogue\\" (ASN 0898793491) if you want to know more about THIS book, because the content and approach are the same.Although he's added longer examples than in the previous book, he insists on using the same self-consciously unfunny, unhelpful and even confusing \\"Socratic dialogue\\" between himself and a fictional \\"student\\" character.He's also added a 4-page introduction defending this choice and bragging about the original book's reprints and translations. (So I suspect he's seen the reviews at Amazon. You'd think he'd learn something from that.) Repackaging alone does not improve this book one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Near 100% Copy of His Earlier Book on Dialogue, and Still Bad !","review":"* This is a rip-off if you already have the previous version.* Still uses the same useless, and poorly done, 'Socratic' conversation method.* You will spend more time trying to figure out what the heck he is trying to put across than you will actualy learning about Dialogue.* You will go crazy trying to find the actual examples of the concepts that are mixed in with dialogue that does NOT relate to the topic.I would not recommend this book to *anybody* that is trying to learn about the forms of Dialogue or the usage of those forms.

Although I would agree that it is probably to basic science oriented for a medical school neuroscience course, it was enjoyable, thorough, and inspirational.

Given Kandel's outstanding contributions to our understanding of learning, I hoped his book would have similar standards. Most notable of several flaws is that the individual chapters, each being individually authored, were poorly edited and did not provide an integrated picture of the field. Further, some graphs were mislabeled, and in several chapters, this text engaged in the annoying practice of introducing and using new terminology early on and then defining this jargon at the end of the chapter. The material on vision was thorough but audition and the vestibulochlear systems were very skimpy. If you are interested in learning anything about motor systems, I'd recommend you pass this book up for Michael Zigmond's Fundamentals of Neuroscience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a wonderful text!

Some of the research details are outdated, such as the genetics information, but even that is well rounded in what was understood ten years ago.The authors have put together a very clearly written and clean presentation of what is a very difficult subject matter. This is not for the faint of determination or for the lay person without any biology or anatomy background, however. The subjects range throughout history of brain science to functional assessments of neurological and psychological disorders. Anatomy of the nervous system is detailed and thorough as is the physiology.

She writes in the first person which allows the reader to completeley get into the character she is writing about, to understand and feel what this character is feeling. Her new 'Hudson' series is excellent and I am eargerly awaiting the rest of the series. If you haven't read any of her books yet I would recommend that you start with 'Rain' as it keeps the reader occupied with all the different events of 'Rain's' hard life. If you are prepared for the ups and downs of the emotinal roller coaster of this poor families lives, then I would recommend the 'Dollanganger' series, the first series she wrote. I laughed and cried at these great books and I hope you will enjoy them as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY GOOD BOOK!","review":"This is my second review of Rain, and as I stated before, I thought this was a very good book. The fact that rain was bi racial, made me love it even more. I am a Black Woman who has been reading V.C. Andrews books since the tender age of 10 (Heaven was my first). Although the Orphans, and Wildflowers series wasn't as good as her other books. I am happy to see that Black people, or people of color, are no longer reduced to the roles of Maids, Drivers, and Friends often ingnored.

All Rain is Dawn via an African-American girl. As a African-American I found this book(and broken wings) highly insulting. What is V.C. Andrews ghost writer trying to say? Perhaps he should find Mr.Peabody and his wayback machine and go back to 1950 where he belongs. Do all African-Americans live in the \\"hood\\"? Do they all read on a third grade level? C'mon do some research think of something new. Don't insult us we'd like a little change up. You can't just take V.C. Andrews novels and rewrite them into every other book you've made. The only V.C. like novel was Melody and that's still not saying much. How long are they going to keep this writer? At least take him to writing class so he can get some new ideals.

I hope there is a little more originality; that is I hope Rain will have a love interest besides the man she thought was her brother.Very good plot, however.

The characters were pretty run of the mill V.C. Andrews, but I liked the message it sent out at the beginning of the book, when Rain wasn't afraid to be different even though everyone thought she was stuck up and she didn't fit in. I also liked how she didn't come across as bratty and spoiled like the wildflowers. But then the second part got boring and even though Rain was in a better environment, she still seemed stuck up to me, so I really didn't like her character that much, and the plot seemed to borrow from every other V.C. novel that's been written."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a great book","review":"I really enjoyed reading \\"Rain.\\" To many people complain that it is always the same plot. I personally don't think that's true.

I will continue to read these books because of the VC Andrews name but I think the author should make some changes"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL BLACK GIRLS BEWARE","review":"V.C. Andrews should never write a book coming from a black persons view ever again. I was insulted by the way she depicts black people. First of all, Rain is sooooo special and beautiful because she is half white. Her mother was a rich white woman who couldn't keep her half black baby. (Why did she have to mess w/ a black man anyways?)Rain's new parents have been paid to keep her. (Are all black people so low?) Rain's other brother and sister are just so messed up in thier lives, but Rain- who came up in the same envirorment- is near perfect and not like anbody else. If you can get passed this horrible description of the black race then read the book.V.C. Andrews completly ignored the fact that thier is soooo much culture and pride in the black community. The 'hood' isn't just crazy black people running the streets and working hard for nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"After experiencing a moment of nostalgia for the days of Flowers in the Attic and Petals on the Wind, I impulsively purchased a copy of Rain. Big mistake. Apologies to all of the VC Andrews fans out there, but I must say that the majority of the books released via the ghostwriter have been mediocre. The author never expanded beyond a plot outline and Rain, Roy, et. al. came out as caricatures rather than characters. Also, as someone who used to live in DC, I must say that the depiction of the Georgetown area was completely off. It was as if no background was done on location at all. I would be quick to forgive these details if the story had delivered...but it simply didn't. As much as I would like to...I'm not even able to vote this as a favorable \\"guilty pleasure\\" read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cliche Andrews/Ghostwriter Soap Opera","review":"I admit the V.C. Andrews/Ghostwriter series do hold one's interest. The books are like cotton candy -- appealing to look at, but leaving little of substance. The formulaic Andrews is as follows: 1) Shadowy, sinister adult females 2) Protagonist is always a young female with an artistic talent (in Rain's case, acting) 3) Sooner or later the protagonist has sexual relationships prior to reaching adulthood 4) a plethora of nature related metaphors 5) a stupid expression in the books that has come to irk me personally -- \\"putaway heart\\" 6) Twins appear in most of the Andrews/GW books 7) Incestuous relationships between brother & sister, or people raised as brother and sister -- (Cathy & Chis), (Dawn & Jimmy), (Heaven & Tom -- luckily they didn't take their relationship to a sexual level), (Ruby & Paul) and now Rain and Roy. Cliche. I agree with a previous reviewer who expressed disappointment in this book. Add mine as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Blacks or Teens....","review":"This book is alright. The plot seems a little too familiar, though. Yet,first, I like Rain cuz she's a strong and nice person, but she's kinda vain cuz she's half-white (cuz ur half-white, ur all that?). Also, she's a little ho! Look: in \\"Rain,\\" she gets drunk & drops her [...] for some lame guy she barely even knows; in the second book, she has a quickie with a guy who likes her; in the third book, she has premarital sex with her hubby-to-be, Austin. Also in \\"Rain\\" she lets Roy feel her up, even though she dislikes it. And her half-brother Brody likes her. Gross. Next, I hate that blacks are misrepresented/misjudged in the series and some of the characters are racist! Last, whites are shown in this series to be black people's \\"Great White Hope!\\" Thus, this book neeeds a lot of fine-tuning and it could be better. Much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Shower\\" of Praise","review":"This book was enthraling from the beginning. I and a huge fan of V.C. Andrews anyway, I've read every single book by her, and I found that this one was an incredibly written book.

Andrews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle?","review":"I have been reading V.C. Andrews' books every since I was in junior high. I would invade the bookstores to see if her new releases came out. The people in the bookstore know me by name. When I read Rain I was deeply disappointed. There were some good parts of the book. I did like the fact that the grandmother wasn't a cynical old witch and that she admired Rain's mother for bringing her up with morals. But it was the same plot used over and over and over again. I agree with most of the reviewers that gave a poor rating on this book. V.C. Andrews must be rolling in her grave to see her pride and joy decline in such a droll fashion. What happen to the thrilling writing and the edge of your seat suspence. Books like Flowers in the Attic and My Sweet Audrina. If you are a novice to V.C. Andrews books I suggest you start with Flowers in the Attic and work your way down. You'll see how her writing style was fresh and full of wonder and not where it is: Reduced, Reused and Recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"VCA Must Be Rolling Over in her grave....","review":"Dawn, I mean Ruby, i mean Rain, yeah, Rain was just the same old thing only repackaged in a different form. It gets very tiresome that the ghostwriter doesn't use his own material when he writes these novels then they would be very exciting and might actually be good. Not really looking forward to Secrets of the Morning, oops, i mean Lighting Strikes. With the mini-series, I lost all faith in the VCA francise for it seem to degrade VCA's memory and writing talent. His excuse for writing the crappy mini-series is that he felt that VCA would have moved onto today's problems. If she didnt write about today's problems when she was alive, why would she write about them now if she was still living? It's just an excuse to churn out these sappy TEEN oriented novels and kick us older readers to the side. So, mr author of the DEvil's Advocate, i read your the novels that you wrote under your real name why cant you add some of your writing to VCA?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"I ordered this book on my daughter's rating of this book.

It was some what realistic compared to some books that have been wriiten by V.C. Andrews. I have to also say that one character in the book did drag on and he really could have been left out. But all in all it kept my attention and it had a fairly descent plot. I guess the book could of used more of a suspense, vigance and mystery. What most of the readers are use to. I think they are just giving the ghost writter a hard time. I think it would be a great movie and it might draw attention considering Rain is bi-racial. I cant wait till the next book comes out I'm definetly going to buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rain","review":"I really liked this book. I have been reading her books for a really long time. When I found out that she had died and someone else was going to be writing them i was a little up set. Anyhow this book was good if you have read her others and like VC Andrews. But a lot of her books are the same. They almost all include some sort of insest and are all kind of the same. This book reminded me of Dawn. The way her parents were poor and not really her parents. I mean they didn't do a good job describing DC at all. I live there and it is not at all the way it was discribed. But like i said, if you like her books then you will like it. My personal favorite book was Ruby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but...","review":"I love this organizer.

MY only complain is that it does not sit the way the picture shows. I put it together and somehow the bins do not sit the way they do in the picture.

Records, but I can tell that his relationship with them went sour. They were supportive during his Purple Rain era, but later disintegrated long after that. Fortunately, Musicology is selling like crazy now, which makes this 1994 album completely forgettable. Save your money and get his latest one, Purple Rain or 1999 instead.

I suggest you listen to the entire cd from start to finish without stopping. The theme (if there is one) is to give you a taste of what he can do. You can't compare \\"Solo\\" to \\"Loose\\". You can try but you'll only frustrated yourself. Get the cd, give yourself some time, and be prepared for an emotional ride. You'll be happy and sad, feel sexy and want to rock, from one song to the next. Listen to the entire cd and you won't get stuck on what you think Prince music should be and just enjoy what you hear.

When was Prince ever \\"standard\\"?Favorite track on this CD? I dunno. That's why this CD is so good. This is a Prince fan's album, because only a Prince fan will be able to dig it. It's a shame that it has to be that way, but I think only intellect of a Prince fan would allow them to enjoy this album. And if you can find it, get the \\"Space\\" maxi-single.

Jill Jepsen (editor) looks not at a \\"deaf culture\\" but at many experiences with deafness, a generous decision. Some deaf people live with signing, others with hearing aids and other mechanical devices, some with tinnitus and some without. Jepsen knows there is no ONE deaf culture, but many individuals who experience their handicap by fight or flight.

I didn't like all that other realm crap and couldnt be more disappointed that I ended up paying full price for it. A great author isnt going to get it right everytime so I dont fault her at all I just really HATED this book.Pia Thomason's tale on the other hand was absolutely hillarious.

The main character, Portia is not likeable. In fact, if I were her friend I would have told her to find someone else to vacation with instead of making my vacation a pedant rave fest. I find that if I can't enjoy the main character within the first few pages of the book, I have a very hard time continuing reading the book. I got as far as page 75 and still couldn't find a reason anyone would like this woman. My feeling is that this is what my highschool teacher labeled as a \\"potboiler\\" which the author churned out in order to make a deadline while working on a better book.

After 135 pages I simply gave up, luckily I had a Keri Arthur for back up! The Portia character over analyzes everything to the point of boredom and then does it all over again a few chapters later. I got it the first time, you do not believe in the paranormal. Didn't some one write that a reader reads once and retains so you do not need to belabor a point over and over again? Portia is a pain pain and in my opinion the romance never really took off.

Even when she has a rain cloud following her around, she still refuses to believe and insults everyone around her who does. I found it incredibly hard to finish this novel because of her character.

Then you overshoot your target (Icon, text, hyperlink...you name it).The designers may in fact be genius. At $10 it's not worth a return trip to the store to get your money back and they probably make them for a buck. Sound business plan. I wish I had purchased a 10 dollar pet rock.

I taped mine down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great surface, a little thin though","review":"I'm quite happy with this pad. It has a huge working area, and the surface is very good for my optical mouse. My only complaint would be that it's a bit flimsy, and it slides a bit on my glass desk. Nothing that a little strip of rubber on the bottom corners won't fix, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"nope","review":"they say this thing sticks to your desk but i guess no one has ever used it on a wooden desktop. still slides around like crazy. also, understand this is not like a typical mousepad. it's not thick and cushy. it's basically a thin sheet of hard plastic. might as well just call it a desk protector, not a mousepad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surface is ok, backing is poor","review":"The pad is large and the response with the laser mouse seems ok (at least better than my desk but nowhere as good as a Razer mouse pad I had tried previously).

This is what I considered part of the thesis of the book as well. However, as I read this book it seemed to me that very little of the book concentrated on the struggles women made during the Civil Right Movement of the 1960's. The book focused mostly on the race issue of the movement only sporadically mentioning the struggles women faced. I feel that she could have asserted her personal experiences in a more profound manner by keeping foucus on her thesis \\"The Roots of Women's Liberation in the Civil Rights Movement & the New Left\\". This book is a valuable read from the historic perspective, but I do not consider it to be an easy read fucused on its main subject matter.

Nothing drags-a major asset and not as pro forma as one might expect. The ECO is excellent throughout. For example, the third movement winds ripieno in #1 and the trumpet led second and fifth movements of #4 are ideal. Soloists are distinguished. Tempi are also appropriately lively throughout #3, in which some conductors are too leaden. My lone caveat concerns fairlyintrusive ornamentation in the Air. Leppard employs little of it elsewhere in this program, but this is a forwarning in case such practices are annoying. Since it is the only problematic movement in the three Suites, I think, the disc still deserves five stars.Peers: Van Beinum; Richter (especially #s 1 and 4); Marriner; Rilling; Szell (in #3)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Storyline ....","review":"Since Amazon didn't post an editorial review, here's a quote from the back of the book to help to you decide if this book is for you: \\"This is the compelling saga of men and women torn between family and tradition, ambition and fame, passion and need ... a story of the troubled and talented Daniel Kirshbaum, whose struggle to rise above his poor immigrant heritage becomes the driving force in his life. It is a tapestry of lives interwoven and intermingled, a world of glamor and ghettos, crime and passion, love and hate, war and peace, triumphs and tears -- and above all, of one man's unrelenting determination to survive ... an all-consuming saga that spans four generations in the life of a fascinating, gifted man, and the remarkable women who enriched his world.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!

It is dark and deep and not very lovely. But it is also unforgetable. It lodges there in the mind with the great horror stories, like Shirley Jackson's THE HAUNTING OF HILL HOUSE and Henry James's TURN OF THE SCREW.The subject matter is simple enough:an urban neighborhood, a dysfunctional family functional enough to fool most of those neighbors, an innocent but unfortunately chunky child, and a father who seems normal on the surface, but underneath makes Hannibal Lector look like Mr. Rogers.This book takes chances and this writer isn't afraid to lift up rocks and look under them, then unblinking describe what she sees.This book may be a neglected masterpiece of suspense.

This is not James Sallis' style in this book, and is why I do not recommend it. His main character, Turner, waxes philosophical about the gray areas of life, and comes off annoying rather than sympathetic or interesting. The plot holds great promise, but in the end also comes across as weak and as unsatisfying as a bag of Cheetohs on an empty stomach. I was disappointed. If you like detective fiction or are an afficionado of noir, I would suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"be warned..kindle version unreadable","review":"All:The kindle version of this book is almost completely unreadable.The paragraph spacing in the first five pages makes no sense...simple paragraphs are broken to four and five.Though I really liked the little writing that I read: I returned it right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"He writes well, but...","review":"Sorry to wreck this little lauditory parade, but the attempts by Sallis to describe Southerners are Walt Disney phony.

I guess you have to be a real Southerner to see it, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost me for sure!","review":"I am very disappointed with Cypress Grove and myself for reading it through to the end. What punishment. The story line wobbles all over the place with flashbacks to Turner's previous various life experiences and then, repeatedly, runs right into disjointed dialogue giving no indication of which characters are conversing. Not much of a storyline, but painfully drawn out to a fairly predictable ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid for this ?","review":"Not well written. disjointed and hard to read.

There is a lot of action in the story... well the second story... the one that is all memories and has nothing to do with the story taking place in the present. Sallis has an amazing gift of description but when I am plodding through a book trying to understand what is supposed to be happening the last thing I want is 3 pages of description of one character.If Sallis were to put more time into just one story instead of about 20 pages of a murder mystery followed by a whole bunch of filler words and confusing flashbacks then I am sure it would be an astounding book. As for Cypress Grove, unless you are studying up on flashy descriptive writing, I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disorganized, poor writing","review":"Every other chapter is about the past of the protagonist, but not especially in an ordered way.

In Practically Perfect the heroine's little quirk is that she is not only a liar and a thief, but a whinging selfish little beast - ultimately unlikeable. This wouldn't break the novel, but something goes wrong with the plot and from about halfway it's pretty much a hasty gallop to a cliched ending.Although the novel's intended to be humourous, I don't remember smiling at the laboured antics.

Once I put the thing together, the plastic casing was splitting and bulging. Does not feel safe to use, at all.The thing is so short and small. It's the perfect size if I wanted my dog to trim the yard. I stand at 5'10, I had to bend down to reach the ground with this garbage. Used it for a few minutes before I started feeling it in my back.

I also read that the line is available at local stores so you won't have to order it online, which is another reason why I purchased this item.

Honestly I think you could stop it with your hand and not get hurt. It just will not cut the grass without holding the unit over the blades for several passes. Also the way it is built (so the blade on the safety guard cuts the line if it gets too long) slows down the line even more.

However the line began to feed backwards while I was using it, I think because of the guard design, which became inconvenient. Apart from that, after about 1 1/2 years of owning it, the electric motor burned out on me, for no apparent reason, with standard use in a small front yard. I'm quite disappointed with the outcome. It may have been in part due to the 1.8 amp power rating. I will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"The weeds are laughing their grasses off.","review":"I own a powerful Ryobi dual string trimmer that can bring down a small jungle, but maintaining the spool and the string is a nightmare, so I bought this simple little trimmer thinking I could use it for a quick trim around my grass.It's not quick! It's underpowered and the cutting swath is about two inches less than I really need. It got the job done, but I didn't save any time, and in the long run that means I didn't save any money. The only thing saves were the lives of weeds.This is great if you've got a little postage stamp lawn with wimply little grass that just gets out of line on occasion and you have to trim it back. If you have any serious crabgrass you need to get under control, forget it and buy a real weed whacker."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small size product with lots of BIG power","review":"The perfect size trimmer for both tough trimming and delicate yard manicuring.

But, after using it several times I got to like it. It is not heavy to hold, and once I learned the know-how in trimming grass it was easy to use. The only problem is that I get grass clippings stuck all over my legs because of the protective shield being so small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Duty","review":"What I love about this is that it is very light and easy to work with. I'm not especially strong in my arms and I was so happy to see how lightweight this is. The downside is that it'll only trim grass and nothing too thick.

I definitely expect at such a price I can at least have everything I need to use it for a while, but it hasn't a cable in the box! It has only a polarized plug, and the plug is built into a socket-like indentation so that you will need a kind of dedicated extension cable to use it. Dubiously, a cable at price $[...] appeared in the recommendation list the the bottom of the product page. Nobody wants to spend $40+ dollars on this thing!This is a creepy way of doing business, much like the Canon printers which don't include usb cables. So creative...

It does a great job trimming around a brick wall and the sides of our home. This is perfect for what I wanted in a trimmer. The spool works great when I needed extra line.

I'm thinking about purchasing another for this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this trimmer to work on a small front yard, thinking it would save me time and hassle. Well, it worked the opposite way. The trimmer is very noisy, I don't think my neighbors appreciate it even though I avoid the early morning hours. The thing is just plain noisy. Another issue is the power cable hook up. I plug my extension cord into the slot, which is located near the handle. Well, if I move the trimmer from side to side repeatedly as if cutting the grass the cord will come off. I have to plug it in several times while working and this is annoying. Third issue is the mess. By the time I am done there are grass clippings all over my shoes, legs and pants (even though I try to be careful and keep it away from me while cutting).This product is affordable but not worth it. I ended up buying a gas-powered trimmer and got better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"pile of junk for my needs, but that is understandable for the price I paid for it. but string trimmers are junk anyway because the string always breaks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty small, but it works","review":"This product is definitely not for heavy-duty jobs, but it works for simple stuff around the house. It is a pretty small model, and the cutting diameter isn't very big, but it's easy to use - you can even use it with one hand, which is nice when you need to hold up branches to cut underneath. Can't beat it for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I just needed something to cut grass around the edge of the lawn. I figured anything should work on grass, so I went for the cheapest. It works fine, but to my surprise it actually works better on slightly thicker stock, like stiff weeds. It tends to push the grass abit rather than cut it sometimes, but if you hold it at a slight angle it works fine.I decided to test its limits and was able to cut through about 5 heavy sprouts from my tree roots before the line snapped. I just pulled out a little more length and kept going. Its not designed for use on heavy vegetation, so I don't recommend that, but its nice to know it is capable on occasion.More expensive models probably use higher speed and smaller,stronger line able to cut more efficiently, but if your needs are simple, Theres no reason to pay more.I would have rated this 3.5 of 5 if possible, but the price kicks it up to a 4-star product in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"withstands my teenager","review":"Bought at the same time as our Black & Decker LM175 18-inch 6-1/2 amp electric mower this little grass trimmer has held up very well.

Even worse, after 2 days use, yes, 48 hrs use, something burned at the head, no fire, but I smoke burned fume, and it never will start again. I called black & Decker for info and was not able to get in contact with a live operator. End of story, dont buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy this trimmer","review":"I bought this mini and weak trimmer just because it's cheap. But I would like to remind you not to buy this. I only used twice and returned for the refund in 30 days. The second time I used it only took less than 10 minutes, then the electric motor blew off smelly smoke, burned I thought.This trimmer is not powerful enough. It's too weak to handle even a small garden. Use your hands and manual trimmer for your small garden is even better and quick than using this short arm trimmer. This is a bad product no matter how cheap it is.Amazon won't let me post the review if I refuse to rate it (zero star). So I rated it one star instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for edging lawns","review":"I purchase this to edge a fairly small yard and for light weeding. Pros - The string does seem to feed well, it's light and it's cheap. The Cons - Not recommended for edging as the unit is too short and requires you to bend over in an awkward position. The 9\\" also is not large enough for my use as it is difficult to reach the ground other than in a very small area. The power is adequate for my needs - barely. I suspect I will go back to a 14\\" model. My old Weeder Eater worked reasonable well for my needs and to rotating head work like a charm when moving from weeding to edging. I should have tried this out at the hardware store first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headed for recycling","review":"It would have been easier and quicker to use a nail scissors to do the job. I found I had to get very close to the area being trimmed, and despite the line being at full length, only got about a 4 inch area. To edge, the trimmer needed to be turned on its side and actually held against the grass.The advantage is its light weight, but this is offset by the marked vibration, which makes it difficult to hold for any length of time. And although the cord is secured to the handle, that doesn't stop it from popping out of the electrical connection frequently.I had a previous Black and Decker trimmer, which lasted 20 years. Unfortunately, the trend is for bigger and more cumbersome trimmers. I'm glad to read the review of this one which says it's \\"disposable\\". It's headed for recycling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts well","review":"The other reviews told me what I needed to buy this. It's light, not too unwieldy, easy to use. My hands were tired the first couple of times I used it trying to reach too far. Now I just balance it & swing it lightly back & forth. Cuts fast, cuts well. Doesn't tear up other things closeby.Only downsides are that you can't see exactly where you are cutting and long extension cords need to be re-wrapped when done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy even you had $.","review":"The 1.8 amp motor ran but less or no power to cut grass. I am afraid the motor will burn out after 15 minute. I did a no load run free test with a good amp meter. Oh no, the motor draw 1.2 amp not 1.8 amp(I posted one photo you can view it). So do not buy I rate it from 2 star to 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"works ok if your 5 foot","review":"Im 6'2\\" and this thing is tiny. I always have to hunch over.

It does a very great job in trimming around my yard. If you have a small yard as I do,this is a great deal in owning this product for the great job it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow cutting path","review":"I read the other reviews about this before buying, but figured that a 9-inch cut path would be fine. I haven't measured the cutter, but it seems like the stated diameter includes the string spool as well. In this way, you only get a string length of about 2.5 to 3 inches. Worse yet, the cutting end includes a small blade in the guard to ensure that the string gets cut off at that length. Meanwhile the \\"guard\\" itself is only wide enough to hold that blade, so it doesn't protect against any flying debris. For me, this is the most useless tool I could ever imagine using. Technically, it works (in that it spins a plastic string around in circles), but it doesn't have the power or cutting path to be useful for anything. I'm very disappointed that I purchased this trimmer; if only Amazon allowed zero-star ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on power.","review":"Did not like this product at all. I was in all honesty, trying to save a dollar or two... but I do not have a large piece of property and only needed it to trim my lawn at the sidewalks and around some rocks... just regular lawn. Anyway, I had to make 2 or 3 passes to get the lawn to edge to the sidewalk. My previous trimmer was just an inexpensive toro that I bought at Home Depot about 10 years ago. The housing finally broke. Even though that was a cheap trimmer, it worked well and took only 1 pass to edge. This Black and Decker Model really added about an extra 15 minutes to trim my lawn. I will upgrade to a heavier duty model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even strong enough to cut through grass","review":"Cheap price and product. This trimmer certainly falls under the you get what you pay for department. The motor is so weak that the trimmer barely cuts through the grass in my yard.

Joined by an all star cast, Ben soothes and slides his way through some traditional Christmas favorites. Personally, I could do without the vocals (not that I don't appreciate Neil Young, Johnny Cash, etc.) it's just that I think Ben could have pulled off releasing an all instrumental recording. His pedal steel guitar playing is excellent (as always) and is a beautiful instrument to interpret these Christmas songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Splendid","review":"You will look a long time to find better performances of these symphonic standards.

We adore the three originals, the Curse of the Were-Rabbit, and the Cracking Contraptions shorts collected onWallace and Gromit: Three Amazing Adventures. We were already huge fans before we became parents, and have loved watching them over and over with our now four-year-old. But this is a huge let-down for us as adult fans, and a betrayal for us as parents: mostly because of the violence, which is far darker and crueler than anything in the earlier films, but also because of the contemptuous treatment of the villainess, essentially an evil fat woman who is evil because she is fat. Our child was puzzled and confused by the film, and we are deeply disappointed. Don't assume that you'll like it, or want to show it to your kids, because of the superlative quality of the other, earlier films in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the quality of Wallace and Gromit?!?!","review":"Being a big fan of anything Wallace and Gromit, I was really excited when I heard about A Matter of Loaf or Death. After reading the reviews on Amazon... I wasn't so sure. I am so happy I got it through Netflix instead of buying it!!! What a disappointment! While the animation was fabulous, the story line was weak and not thought out. I was surprised by the violence towards the poodle by Piella. I wouldn't recommend this for children. Again, very~very disappointing. I won't be wasting my money on this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Wallace & Grommet original humor?","review":"Disappointing. Not the original ideas or humor as the previous animations. More like a rehash of old stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half baked","review":"This is about a half-hour feature, and in my opinion is not classic as the first three Wallace and Gromit shorts were from the 1990's.First of all, one of the wonderful things about W and G is that it's fun for the grown-ups and the kiddies, but starting off with someone being murdered wasn't so fun and wasn't something I wanted to be part of \\"family movie night\\".And, they give away the murderer right off the bat so it's really not a mystery at all, just something to sit through. What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add Loaf and Death to your W&G collection","review":"As said in the special features, this is a half-hour Wallace and Gromit movie done on a TV budget. Maybe not as amazing as Were Rabbit, but still an essential for any W&G fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Quality Wallace and Gromit","review":"I am a huge Wallace and Gromit fan so it is almost painful for me to rate this one so low. All other Wallace and Gromit material I rate with five stars. However, this one gets only two stars from me because it is a bit violent for young children and I was disturbed by the scenes with animal abuse. The entire DVD lacks the wholesome fun that is associated with Wallace and Gromit and make it a must miss for all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dark, Violent Film, Unlike Other W&G Films","review":"My kids love the Wallace & Gromit movies, all of them. So naturally, we bought this one based solely on the trailers. The movie is short but the animation is excellent like other W&G; movies.The problem is that this is a very dark, violent film when compared to other Aardman/Nick Park movies. Although no graphic scenes are shown obviously, the story indicates that actual murders happen, dogs are hit, and a person is eaten by a crocodile. Yes, of course it's not a horror movie, but those expecting a typical child-friendly movie should reconsider.Why did the producers go so dark with this one? My 5 year-old kept saying, \\"That was the meanest film I've seen!\\" A letdown. Hopefully future W&G; movies will not go this route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Wallace and Gromit standards","review":"The story was straightforward and not funny. It was exceptionally violent for a Wallace and Gomit feature. It wasn't 87 minutes long either, it was much shorter.

It takes a lot of effort to do this type of clay stop-motion animation, especially with the huge amount of loving detail the creators put into each scene. That means that the output is limited and a fan is always left wanting more.This is the latest W&G; short film, and worth owning. It has the same basic themes as other W&G; films: Wallace is foolish; underappreciated Gromit must defeat the villain and save the day; there are lots of ingenious mechanical devices.If you've seen any of the other W&G; films: The Wrong Trousers, The Curse of the Wererabbit, etc., and were left wanting more, this will live up to your expectations. If you haven't, this is as good a choice as any to get to know them."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHO wrote this!?","review":"I've seen and enjoyed all the Wallace & Gromit films UNTIL NOW.\\"Loaf or Death\\" was a severe departure from the charm of this series.

You might have heard some of their stuff as background music on MTV (Date My Mom plays \\"Coda\\" every other episode). They seem to me a kind of culmination of other pop punk bands (i.e. SoCo, TSL) but still manage to have a signature sound. There are some flat spots on the CD, but the sheer number of tracks helps compensate for this. Tracks 2-6 (too lazy to name) are awesome, then it gets a little lame, but by track 12 its good times again.

Things that could optimize your experience would be to make sure the songs you have in file form run above 320kbps. Because even 2,000 dollar headphones will sound like crap if your songs run at 24kbps. Still these headphones sound great and the songs ive listened to are running at 128kbps which surprised me.

The headset doesn't really close right over my ears so it feels akward, and the sound quality is mediocre at best.Oh, and the responding frequency reported on this site is false. It is not 18-22khz.

But, if you are looking for something with decent sound quality (keep the sound simple, in other words), light, not pressuring your head, and having closed features (meaning passively reducing the outside noise), then you won't go wrong with this one.

The balance is perfect. I would have liked them to be a bit tighter over my head, but I'll get used to them. Some may want louder, but I find them to be plenty loud enough. Any louder and I'd have a perpetual headache! They are definitely noise canceling because they do a wonderful job of drowning out my noisy cube neighbors. I certainly could not be happier with the price!The one thing I miss from my old headphones is the volume control on the cord.

I just returned it","review":"I just bought this headphones based on the big amount of positive reviews. As soon as I plug it to my laptop and my ipod, I realized the lack of bass and a medium level sound they produce. I just returned it to the store and exchanged by a Pioneer SE-MJ721-K, and let me tell you... WHAT A DIFFERENCE !!!! This ones ROCKS !!! as the package printing says: BASS HEAD.

Comfortable. OK sound. TV volume turns off when plugged in. Long enough cord. Bought to listen to TV and for that purpose works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous cord","review":"The headphones themselves are great. Sound quality is excellent and they are very comfortable. My main problem is that it that the cord attached is 10 feet long... way longer than needed for walking around listening to your music in the street. Unless you like carrying a huge bundle of extra cord in your pockets, this isn't very practical. I'm sure it would be convenient if you wanted to connect it to your TV and watch from your couch or something like that. But then why not keep the cord at a sensible length and sell a separate extension for times you need more cord. It may seem silly to quibble over that, but to me it's really annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK!","review":"I am really disappointed! I realize that these headphones are not intended to be audiophile quality being in the $20-30 range, but even at that price they disappoint: cheap construction materials, not loud AT ALL, 9-ft of thin cord (way too long) and absolutely NO BASS - my $7 Altec-Lansing earbuds have twice the range and volume of these over-ear headphones...save your money and spend a little extra on a better quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long cord, decent sound","review":"The length of the cord seems just right. It's not too long or too short.The sound produced is probably average quality; it's probably not for crazy audiophiles but they are good work headphones.There isn't a ludicrous amount of cushioning on the inside, so your ears may hurt after several hours. Still, it's above average and definitely better than earbuds.The headset is light and relatively sturdy. It doesn't kill all outside noise but it does the right amount for a work environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very breakable","review":"I got three of these headphones and they all broken, my Sennheiser HD 280 PRO is still alive but I had to change the ear pads and head pad foams, this replacement makes my Sennheiser HD 280 PRO feel like NEW after 3 years of use. I think cheap Sennheiser products are nonsense. This one is very bad. very very bad.

I compared these headphones side-by-side with a few other headphones I own, (using the same segments of the same songs). These HD201's sounded so \\"muffled\\", and had such limited-range, that I thought I must've gotten a defective pair. So I contacted Sennheiser to ask them to look into this problem. They had me ship the headphones to them, and sent me a replacement pair, ... and the replacement has the same sub-standard sound as the one I returned! The other 3 headphones that I compared these headphones to were similarly-priced as the Sennheiser 201's, but all of them sounded far superior to the 201's, (one was manufactured by Steel-Series, another [bluetooth] was by \\"GoGroove\\", and the third was by JBL). I do not recommend these HD201 headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might as well not even wear them","review":"I read all of the great reviews so I bought the HD 201 headphones.

I was surprised that the headset does nothing to keep the music your listening quiet for those around you.

The bass was okay, treble was good, but the midrange vocals sounded very nasal and tinny. I think this is due to the completely closed design of the ear cups, which make it sound like a tin can. The Panasonic has some holes to allow some natural resonation. If you want good-sounding closed design, you will have to spend much more money.Although this was not in the specs, I estimate the driver to be 30mm upon visual inspection.Pros:Ear cups have 2 axis of freedomFoam padding on headbandCons:Sound is nasally and tinny. Can get better sound at same price.Ear cups are too shallow, ears will touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for the money","review":"These are no where near higher end headphones, but for the price I can't complain too much.

I was impressed. They have very good quality and can pickup distinct notes on each tune.I currently use an old, but still great Nomad Jukebox 3, with 98db noise sensitivity, higher than most mp3 players on the market. There is a noticeable difference than other headphones I've tried before. I would not call them excellent since they do lack the bass that Koss' KTXPRO1's have (similiar price range,) but they are very good for the price. I'm just wondering if the lack of bass is do to underpowering of the phones; maybe an amp is needed.Overall, they have a crisp sound, med/low bass, are very comfortable, and have a very long cable cord, roughly 6ft (which gets kind of cumbersome holding all that slack.)Don't expect them to be hifi in a lowfi package, but they will do very well replacing your OEM headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"buying second pair","review":"There are other great reviews here detailing all the things that are great about these headphones, and not just \\"for the price\\". I do have a portable headphone amplifier, but i rarely even use it with these, the sound is very good. I have an admittedly wide head, and these fit very well and comfortably, I wear them for up to and sometimes over 4 hours at a time with no issues. Where other sets can be too tight, too hard, or made from material that wont let your skin breath, these have none of those issues. Be aware that while very comfortable, they are not silencing or anything of the sort, outside noise is not dampened much at all. This works for me though as i need to be able to hear the phone ring or someone call from across the house. I use them on a few laptops and now my girlfriend uses them on her laptop as well to watch TV shows and movies...hence the order for my second pair ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the HD 202","review":"I have the HD 202s which I have enjoyed but found the ear pieces to be slightly too narrow so when I needed a new pair to keep at home (202s are work headphones) I picked up a pair of 201s.I work in pro audio so I felt the need to compare the 201s to the 202s.202 wins by a mile.The HD 201s are comfortable and sound clean enough but they have no bottom end. The HD202 have a much fuller sound with clear highs and rich deep notes. The 201s sound flat. I am going to send them back and order 202s.

Also, you have to turn the volume up very high on your device to get a reasonable volume through the headphones.

I'm no audiophile but these meet and exceed and satisfy my aural needs. Note that I got the HD201S (has an 'S' on the end) so maybe some updates to the product since some of the reviews I read on Amazon, one I noticed is that the cans swivel slightly now so that they contour to the ear better.

I got no cable wrap in the box like some other guy on here. They are big and stretch over my big melon head to completely cover my ears.

They have good quality- while they last. This was actually the second pair that I bought. The first pair broke after a few months- something inside the wiring in the jack meant that I got the sound in one ear at a time, if that. (which ear was working varied, and sometimes I could get both ears working) I thought I would try my luck with a second pair- they ARE cheap, and like clockwork, three months and the exact same problem. This time it's even worse, though- I can only get sound in my left ear if I'm actively applying pressure to the jack and twisting it.A number of replies to the other one-star reviews provide contact information to the company with a claim that there's a two-year warranty.

The pads are passably comfortable, and of course, they're composed of an inexpensive leatherette.Most listeners seem to prefer the Koss KSC35 or 75, but many headphone designers have products that surpass these.

Zero bass response. So don't get them if you are expecting to hear low end. I compared them to my cheap radio shack phones I got a few years ago for around 26 bucks.

The leatherette is stiff, not comfortable at all. The plastic is cheap I don't know how long would it last. They are too big so they didn't fit me and the noise reduction is null since they don't make any pressure over my ears, and they keep falling backwards from my head.

At a higher volume, the music is slightly more quality, but the music still lacked substance to me.There was this, and there was the fact that the leatherette around the edge of each of the earpieces gave me discomfort because the phones concealed my ears completely but not my lobes, and it felt almost like blood got cut off at that part.

I have to say, I'm very impressed. The headphones are lightweight, the sound is very clear and the bass is decent, although not as deep as would be expected from heavier headphones. The one drawback I found with these phones is the relatively thin cord, which looks like it may be prone to pulls/fraying/snagging [which for me is a problem as I have two young kids who are rough on such things.]Over all, a great option for the price [which is less than half the price of the popular designer phones such as Beats audio, etc.] I will do an long-term update after a while to let you know if it can stand the test of time [and kids.]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, not good","review":"Headphones advertised as \\"noise canceling\\".

I've had to return or give away 3 headphones already because my ears or head hurting after several hours (or even 1 hour) of use due to pressure or the weight of the headphone on my ears and head.

Comfortable enough I can wear them all day at work over my glasses without problem. They don't isolate sound as much as I'd really like, but I suppose that I'd need sound-cancelling for that.

The Cord is long but can be folded up neatly if you don't want to move around or risk tripping on it.I primarily use it for late night gaming and it does the job.The only improvement I would suggest is to add a little bit more bass.

Maybe they look better and feel more comfortable, but the drivers are lower quality, and they are much higher impedance than most headphones are, resulting at much lower sound levels. What I find, I have to crank the computer volume to 100% and sometimes it is still not loud enough, especially for some youtube video clips where a person speaks softly.Buy HD 202, a far better option for about the same price. See my review on it as well.If Sennheiser would take 201 frame and put 202 drivers in it, that would be a far better option, and might be worth extra 10 bucks, but as is, 201 is considered junk in my opinion, having used several Sennheiser models including their true professional level units.Avoid this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Comfortable","review":"The ear cup is shallow.

And being I'm a rather large person...6'6\\" with a head to fit, there is actually room from adjustment. By that I mean I expected to just pull them out as far as they would go...the ear pieces.. and hoped they fit. I had to tighten them up some. And comfortable too.The sound from them is incredible.

But, I have to tell you these are not their best. In fact, they must be their worst! They have no sensativity at all! To drive the speakers in these earphones you have to crank up the volume to near max before you can hear anything.

The main character, Jessica, pushes the limits. She explores erotic spanking, outdoor sex, and finds herself in a decadent threesome with a co-worker and male roommate. Other characters in the book are even more wild-- one male actor engages in a s/m relationship with an older, wiser woman who knows how to wield a belt.

Pretty 20-year-olds are boring. There's a reason why the character Avalon (gossip columnist for the newspaper) stole every scene she was in; she was experienced enough to have some depth, which made the sex charge that much hotter.2. While I don't demand too much of a plot from erotic novels, having some storyline makes me anticipate reading on, not just a disconnected series of sex scenes.3. This one is purely personal: I live in LA. I love LA. This, Madam, is not LA -- it's the Los Angeles of cliche and clique.

The video quality itself is not so great but more disappointing was the content.Tegtmeier is very articulate about reining, but you quickly get the opinion that he is an \\"old school\\" training who believes in some very \\"physical\\"/bullying tactics.The horses in the video do not seem very disciplined or well-trained. Part of that is Tegtmeier obviously trying to explain the training and being somewhat distracted. Still, you would expect the best mounts he had available to be showcased in the video.Not impressed with the strategies, training techniques, or \\"drills\\" discussed in this video. I will probably not watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very passionate and sensual","review":"I loved it. I especially loved the connection with the Witches. After I read the book I did some more research on the Wicas. Even though it didn't have too many sex scenes, there was a lot of sensuality and desire that really made the story vivid for me. The only part of the story that was not realized to its potential was the threat of evil from the past. I thought it would incarnate into something physical but it never really amassed to much. Fortunately, the rest of the story line was strong enough without it and very powerful indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheap design","review":"I've had a number of these by other manufacturers, this is by far the worst design and quality I've ever had.

Afterwards, Stevie Nicks called it quits, and was replaced on \\"Time\\" with newcomer Bekka Bramlett. And '70s veteran Dave Mason was thrown in for good measure. The result barely rises above awful. Even the otherwise reliable Christine McVie - the only remaining songwriter from Fleetwood Mac's glory years - turns in mediocre efforts (perhaps in an attempt to match the boring efforts of the rest of this thrown-together group).In short, \\"Time\\" is for fanatical Fleetwood Mac completists only.

You can read long books, philosophical books and books filled with examples and inspiration. The rules are virtually the same. There are no secrets in Barry J.

You learn what you ought to do and then you get a check list that you can use to monitor your progress. This is a simple, short and fairly complete presentation for any new salesperson. It lacks a treatment of the preliminary closing techniques that are important in discretionary buys, but that is all that is missing.

The 8 inch is perfect for a college student who wants to cook up quick small snacks like eggs. I bought this because I wanted a pan I could flip around, and this pan is so light compared to my 10 1/4 inch skillet.The only reason why I gave it four stars is because I had the impression that it had an 8 inch cooking surface. Instead, it was 8 inches across from lip to lip but the actual cooking surface is only 6 inches across. I felt a little deceived, but the pan is satisfactory, so I'm not complaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Pan","review":"This pan is excellent once you properly season it.

It was a bit smaller than I thought it would be, but I use it all the time: grilled cheese sandwich, omelette, melt butter, small quesedilla, etc. I really do wish Lodge made one between the 12 inch and 8 inch skillets, maybe 10 inch? Anyway, this size is great if you have small children or cook only for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, preseasoned cast iron!","review":"Boy am I glad that I found these here on Amazon. I just love the taste of food cooked in cast iron but absolutely hate taking care of it. My first set rusted on me since I was clueless and now, well, I don't have to worry as much! The preseasoning is just wonderful and cleanup is just a snap. You can't use soap on these pans, just hot water and a soft brush. You can even spray with Pam instead of rubbing on oil if you'd like. What a great idea - now I just wish they'd compete with Le Creuset and make the porcelain-covered cast iron. That would just be perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps a recent decline in manufacturing quality?","review":"I bought both the 6.5\\" and the 8\\" pans this week.

Returned item.The 8\\" pan arrived looking OK, but when put to first use (with eggs), not only did everything stick immediately, but it was impossible to clean--the egg seems to have permanently permeated the patina. So much so, that I'm not going to deal with it; it's also going back. Perhaps I should have seasoned the pan further before first use--but because it's advertised as \\"pre-seasoned\\" and there were no recommendations to do so, I felt comfortable cooking with it out of the box. It was a mistake, and now I have a ruined pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot and Heavy","review":"It's a good sized skillet for a party of 2-3. Keeps food hot longer.

I was drawn to it because it's the same interface as the Nike running watches, but you can replace your own battery which is a huge plus. During the time that it worked, it was a perfect watch. Good chronograph features, 2 time zones, stored runs... it was everything I needed. Then, after about 15 months, the beeper on mine stopped working, which was sad because I tend to use the alarms a lot during my day. Fancy it breaking after a 1 year warranty from High Gear. This would have been fine but when I returned home for the summer, my brother told me his stop watch was no longer working. It still displayed the time, but wouldn't start counting in the chronograph mode. One out of two can be bad luck, but having two out of two fail is strong evidence of very poor quality control. For me I guess it's back to the Nike, and just not being able to replace the battery myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educative doco","review":"It's a very rare topic doco of US soldiers having excaped to enemy and living there happily.Informative, providing info about North Korea I have never seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Rap DVD i seen","review":"It Was the best and kept real DVD i have seen.

THEY WARN YOU ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE DISC 'this is not like our last cd', so why would you be so stupid as to compare them? And though they're awesome Chillout producers, they're wonderful House/Dance producers as well.

All the songs seem drawn out and like they got lost halfway through and just don't reach any conclusion. Go with Lost Horizions instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaving the Living Room for the Clubs","review":"This album defintely marks a new direction for Lemon Jelly. Those expecting an extension/continuation of their last two albums are probably going to be slightly disappointed, as the band has traded in the stoned and spacy headphone grooviness of those albums for a more club-oriented \\"House\\" sound, as if they wanted to be Groove Armada. This works for the most part, though on some songs they lose the uniqueness of sound that made it usually very easy to identify a Lemon Jelly song for a sound that's too generic and repetitive (\\"Don't Stop Now\\" is an example of this). Other songs however, such as \\"Come Down On Me\\" with its sample of a Masters of Reality song (that one was a blast from the past, Chris Goss, hope you're recovering well), do signify an interesting new direction for the band. The ending track with Shatner seems a continuation of the collaboration \\"Together\\" (also recommended) from Shatner's new solo album and is also quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album of filler to accompany \\"Go\\"","review":"This album was thoroughly disappointing for me, with the sole exception of \\"Go\\". As other reviewers have noted, this album feels utterly uninspired and mechanical, as though Lemon Jelly really wanted to release \\"Go\\" as something other than a single and thus cobbled together a bunch of random dreck they could pass off as songs. Although the hallmark of Lemon Jelly's pieces is repetition, this is the first album that actually sounds repetitive. Looped samples are laid over one another in ways that, rather than complimenting each other, clash in disturbingly arhythmic fashions. There is no hint of the building harmonies and complicated syncopations present in their earlier works.All in all, I hope Lemon Jelly decide to return to their former, quirky selves in the future. This album is not representative of their talent or creativity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, Better..","review":"Quit complaining about their new style on this album!

It is a comedy & to my mind better written that a lot of them. A good cast plus a good plot equals a better than you think movie.Dennis Hopper is the low man in his family & why not. He's stuck in the past with his clothes, his music, and his ideals (there you go ideals from a gangster). Of course his ideals include Darryl Hannah who is his heart throb besides being the local porn actress. Hey honey nice dress! They even wrote the script so her Swedish co-star gets the laughs. Any how Frankie is serious about moving up in the world if only his boss would notice. His Boss (Michael Madsen) notices all right & prepares Frankie's daily meals of s**t.This isn't the Godfather or Thief. It is the Godfather on gas. A funny quirky story, with a bit of heart in it.

The premise does not hold water - the plot is based on the formulaic opening scene where the protagonist's perhaps-lover crashes his plane in a dogfight and with his last breath binds our heroine to search for his long-lost brother. As the trail leads to Kenya we are introduced to many two-dimensional characters who speak in unnatural and stereotyped dialogue and confront tribal mysteries that unlike in Alexander McCall Smith, for example, do not bring us even an enlightened white person's understanding of the complex sociology of African cultures. I would give this book a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"The African Savannah and the supernatural","review":"I expected \\"Out of Africa\\" with a bit of mystery thrown in but I was surprised. I appreciated the period setting. I genuinely felt like I was a British ex-partiot after WWI, although the characters, including the heroine, are somewhat broadly drawn. The supernatural touches of the shape-shifters are what surprised me. I like mysteries with a touch of SF but it seemed out of place here. But most of all, the actual solving of the mystery was not that difficult - I knew half the answer a third of the way into the book. And I rarely guess \\"whodunnit\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expect a light-hearted romantic mystery and you won't be disappointed.","review":"I laughed when I read a few of the other reviews of this book.

I enjoyed Nancy Drew when I was a girl and I'm enjoying Jade Del Cameron as an adult. When I'm traveling or really busy and just need a fun, light book to get lost in for 30 minutes at a time, this is perfect. This is the first in the series, but the fourth one I've read. It was good to finally find out just how Jade ended up in Nairobi and who some of the long-term bad guys are. The book starts with Jade just finishing her term as an ambulance driver in France in WWI. Her almost fiance is killed when his fighter plane crashes. She's there when he takes his last breath and asks her to find his mysterious step brother.

I bought this pan and have stuck it in the back of the closet, never to be used. Lodge makes their products with a gritty, rough surface. This causes foods like eggs and anything with a sauce to get stuck in the muck. There is no reason for this. I grew up with a father who collected old Griswald cast iron pans. They are the ideal pan. They are super smooth on the interior. Several friends who have seen or used my pans have commented how they think it is coated with teflon, but it's not. Buy yourself a good Griswald pan on eBay. After each use, wipe it out with a paper towel and leave it alone. Nothing will ever stick to the Griswald unless you REALLY try. Trust me, you will be much happier than you will be with this pan. I now have a nice collection of Griswald pans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light Weight, Perfect for Two","review":"This is a wonderful skillet from Lodge that is perfect for two people. It will accommodate a couple of small steaks or a couple of hamburgers or a few eggs, etc. I noticed the difference in the weight, immediately. It is lighter in weight than Lodge's average skillets of same size. Yes, it still has some heaviness to it but much lighter by far. This is going to be the skillet that stays on my stove because I know already I will be using it most every day. It's especially great when cooking for one or two people. By the way, I read here so often about not using soap to wash your cast iron. You absolutely can use dish soap to wash your cast iron and it really will not hurt it at all. I grew up with cast iron and I use it myself all my life. I do use dish soap on my cast iron from time to time.

I use it every single day to cook for my large family.Can't believe I 'fell' for the teflon-type or anodized skillets; I was purchasing a new one every 2 or 3 years as they do not stand up to daily use. The one improvement we made to both our 15-1/4 and 10-1/4 inch Cast-iron Skillets was to subject them to some serious sanding with our orbital sander.

The cooking surface was rougher than most cast iron utensils are on the outside. Even their website had the following:\\"My new Lodge Cast Iron pan feels rough in some areas, is this normal?\\"\\"Yes. With use and replenishment of the seasoning, the pan will become smoother. Unlike other types of cookware, Lodge Cast Iron only gets better with use. For concerns about roughness, it is OK to use a fine grade of sandpaper to smooth out the rough areas.

I tried an omelet for the first time the other day and had excellent results. No problem folding it in half or releasing it from the pan.

Leonardo Cook is a good soul-a warmly drawn character who is every bit as endearing as Michael Malone's Raleigh Whittier Hayes or John Kennedy's Ignatius J.

The trailer for it seemed promising.Making light of manic depression to me is not funny and you end up feeling bad for the main character because of his illness. There are very few laughs to be had. He suffers from delusions of grandeur and thinks get worse once he stops taking his medication.The ending of the movie is questionable bad taste with a mentally ill man shooting a flasher and being hailed as a hero.I would recommend Knocked Up, Super Bad, Pineapple Express but I would not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"This is a really, really bad movie.

Quite possibly the worst I've every seen. The only other movie that was equally as painful was \\"The Mexican.\\" The \\"humor\\" in this movie was very dark.

Seth Rogen was just plain annoying throughout the whole movie. Im starting to notice that he is annoying in all of his movies. I see why this movie bombed in theaters.

Save your money and watch Mall Cop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mall Cop was better...","review":"Seth Rogan is hit or miss with me. This movie just seems like another typical exploitive ripoff. Any humor is borrowed at best. Just watch Paul Blart instead. It's a better movie and more original.Also, it should be mentioned this movie must have been literally going for the record on the F bomb. The word is used twice in every other sentence, and I am not exaggerating. This is typical of the whole movie. If you like your humor at its cheapest then perhaps this is for you. For me, it was just a distraction and worst of all, not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing to observe here, people","review":"Once Seth Rogen opened his mouth I started fast-forwarding this.

Not sure if I was even halfway through at that point.Swearing is ok by me, but when you use it in every other word without trying to make a point. It's just plain annoying.This movie is also one of those \\"volume\\" movies that exercises your entertainment surround sound. Where you need to turn up the volume to hear them talk, but all of a sudden some loud music or noise out of nowhere will make you reach for your remote to turn it down. It seemed to be a constant during the first half of the movie. That is probably more annoying than the swearing.The script also didn't help any. Unless you are a true Seth Rogen fan. I would skip. Even he can't save this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange, Dark but Just Ok","review":"This movie has its moments. It is very dark and kind of disturbing.

I havent gotten to the end yet but Im pretty sure he ends up with the coffee girl (ugly duckling). The downhill montage was kinda funny. I laughed a little bit a couple times.

It started out quite funny, and then towards the middle and end of the movie it turned into nonsense; a rubbish-written script that leaves you feeling depressed and confused at the end, nothing like Pineapple Express or Knocked Up, or any other. Not recommended at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lunacy on an idiotic level","review":"If that's possible in this Seth Rogen film. A truly stupid movie. A security guard cop wanna-be. Just plain idiotic and not funny at all. Okay. maybe three minutes of funny- With the mall cops kicking the cr*p out of skate boarders in the parking lot (something we'd all like to do).

My apologies to others that like the CD! :-(Why I bought this in the first place: My daughter loved Enya's \\"May It Be\\" song from LOTR - so I set about to find similar music in a genre that I am unfamiliar with. The Mirror Pool came up as \\"similar\\" to Enya music (which I am also unfamiliar with), and the price was right, so I ordered it.Obviously, there are people that love this - but I felt like I should post just in case there are others out there, like me, that are unfamiliar with this music."},{"rating":"2","title":"peaceful and contemplative","review":"lisa gerrard continues to be one of my favorite female voices and The Mirror Pool ranges from peaceful to comtemplative. its richness is layered and i highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty...but pretty worthless","review":"These books were originally written for a French audience, and so unless your climate matches that of France, the statements about the weather that accompanies each season will be inaccurate! \\"Spring is the season of mild, showery weather\\"...summer is a time of brief thunderstorms...beaches aren't cloudy for long...autumn is \\"cool\\" and \\"damp\\"...and it snows in the winter. In addition, like virtually all the books in this series, it contains factual errors--\\"no two snowflakes are alike.\\" That's substituting folklore for fact, which is common with these books.The good points:-The illustrations are lovely-There is a brief, accurate (as far as it goes) description of fog, rainbows, and snow (\\"ice crystals\\")-There is a discussion of the seasons, even if all the details are unlikely to match your climate.This saves it--barely--from one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite..but you might like it","review":"I love many of the other books in the discovery series...I just thought this one wasn't quite as concise and didn't keep it in our little ones' library.

The music was fun and for a flutist that I am, I did appreciate the use of a brass band in a major film.

Thoroughly great flick and a keeper in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Time Favorite","review":"To read the synopsis on the back of the box, you'd assume this is just another fluffy romantic comedy. Did the writer even watch the movie? While it does have its comic and romantic moments it's basically a serious look at the residents of a British mining community and the stress and despair faced by families and community as their source of livelihood, the mine, faces closure. The story follows the one remaining ray of community pride as the miner's Colliery band competes for a shot at the championship in London. It also follows the political and management process of choosing efficiency and profit over the welfare of the miners.The entire film is well acted, the music is outstanding and the story is at once heart-breaking and heart-warming. A wonderful movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music, great actors, right message...","review":"Don't see it for Ewan and Tara, though there's nothing wrong with their performances.This is the kind of movie that most Americans probably would never see without the big names. But, the big names aren't what carry the film. The ensemble, which comprises the Grimley Colliery Band, is filled with very real types of people. You come to appreciate them, and fear for their well-being, as the British government seeks to close their mine.If you love music, you'll like it. If you're an anti-Tory, anti-Republican liberal, you'll like it. If you've ever been mercilessly laid off, you'll be able to relate.

There are many great songs on this album that I heard over my satellite feed at my workplace. Hits include the title track,IT KEEPS YOU RUNNIN' and WHEELS OF FORTUNE. I also heard FOR SOMEONE SPECIAL and LOSIN' END. Following this album is THE BEST OF THE DOOBIES,which is a compilation containing IT KEEPS YOU RUNNIN' and TAKIN' IT TO THE STREETS. McDonald would later re-record LOSIN' END,but in a jazz style,for his 1982 solo debut album IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES. I like the style of CARRY ME AWAY. It has that Motown sound like the Toys' Lovers' Concerto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I like the song Changing Wheels of Fortune so much that I got the CD even though I knew from previous listens that none of the other songs were as strong. But I was pleasantly surprised at what a good overall listen this album turned out to be. I like the old Doobies but I like this album. But the song I mentioned is so strong (to me) that I'd pay the same price for just that song on a single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful sound","review":"This sacd sounds just dreadful. How can MOFI release such crap? I'm really angry that they boast about fantasic soung, etc, when the sound is just muddy, no high, no low end, no nothing.MOFI really has lost the plot. Nor just this release but all the latest releases. They most use the wrong equipment or something. The records they release sounds dull with no snap and no dynamics. I sugest that we as consumeres tell them and protest by sending them e mails telling them this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine music seriously marred by poor sonics","review":"Michael McDonald and Patrick Simmons have outstanding vocal talents and gave us compositions that, even after 30 years, still sound fresh. But you won't get to that conclusion by listening to this CD. While the vocal efforts here are strong, the rythms driving, and the tunes catchy, this CD sounds as if a sonic veil has been thrown over the music. Think of what you hear when listening to a recording that is being played back on speakers in another room, or the sound you would hear using the tiny speakers on, say, a 13\\" TV set, and you will get an idea of how badly this CD captures the band's perfomance. If you enjoy the Doobie Brothers, avoid this recording: it will only cause disappointment over a lost opportunity to appreciate some great tunes played by fine musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite from the Michael McDonald era","review":"Takin' It To The Streets is Michael McDonald's debut with the Doobie Brothers. It is with this album that the band moved away from the party-hard rockin' sound of their previous albums to a more R&B soul type of sound.But as another reviewer pointed out, it is a combination of both styles that is incorporated in this album. Tom Johnston's final effort with the band shows the old style perfectly (Turn It Loose), while the rest of the record tends to lean toward the R&B sound that Michael McDonald brought to the band on tracks like the title track and It Keeps You Runnin'.Other Highlights include Wheels of Fortune, Rio, and Carry me Away. I also dig Tiran Porter's For Someone Special.Bottom Line: A great album to get into."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Song","review":"How many bands over the years have started out with great material only to have another singer come on board and everything changes. Sometimes change is good but when it isnt needed it isnt welcomed. Journey had to get a new singer and in comes Steve Perry and the sappy ballads. The Tom Johnston era Doobie Brothers is a lot better on so many levels wether you agree or not. I dont really need to explain that do i everyone who reads this review has already heard The Doobie Brothers before and if you were blessed enough to have good taste in music having Michael Mcdonald take over the lead vocals wasnt gonna work. Now for me this is a rare case where my favorite song on the album was the big hit. It Keeps You Runnin (Great Hook) is the catchiest song on the album and the only song i like and never tire of. Here is an example of where the keyboard is the hook (im not sure what Michael used for a keyboard here). His vocals are fine on that song but like i said the catchy part is the keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mud","review":"My stereo catches every trebley tinkley note on a recording.

Each track melds into the next, creating a journey into your own mind that is not complete until the faint strains of the final song have finally drifted away. With a deep alto voice that could be favorably compared to the 15-minutes-ago Marc Anthony or the more popular Rufus Wainwright set to gentle drum loops, and an intense trip through several genres that will astound even those with no musical knowledge, this album is a vital addition to any collection, and especially for a quiet afternoon / evening at home. Tikaram manages to be deeply inrtospective without becoming depressing or pretentious, a rare trend in music of the last fifteen years, when depression seems to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"World-Class Warehousing and Material Handling","review":"Interesting overall view for beginners in warehousing.

Since then I learned to appreciate his way of phrasing, as unique in the musiccal world. As time passed and the voice faded gradually, he compensated that with a more dramatic, full of feeling manner of saying every word.As a paradox, one of the more interesting things about this video, at least for me, was the story that HRH Grace Kelly told at the beginning, that shows what kind of human being Sinatra was. You can also find stories like this in the book that his daughter wrote some 3 or 4 years ago.So, if you are a Sinatra fan, don\`t miss this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"The All Time True Singing Champion","review":"In my lifetime, no one, not one, could do all the things Frank Sinatra could. He was the ultimate craftsman. Ballad, swing, blues, big band up-tempo, look out, Frank would sew it together to anyone's satisfaction.This concert with intro by his friend Grace Kelly, shown in color and very good sound, illustrates exactly what this writer said in sentence one. What command! Great pizazz! He's locked in, his leader and the band too. What a collective effort. Know what? Nearly every available concert you see by Sinatra is one of a kind.

As has been said, the best feature is the raised edge; it doesn't interfere with cutting and chopping but it does prevent juices from meats or fruit from running off the sides.My only disappointment is that the surface is not impervious to knife marks. Minor detail as I wouldn't use them as serving platters anyway but they are invaluable for prep work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent me wrong item","review":"I ordered 2 round ones and 2 square ones and they sent me 3 square and one round.

Moved the old boards to the workshop where they are given another life.These prepboards are lightweight, raised on the outer edges to catch juices and prevent rollers from escaping. The clean up well (especially in the dishwasher)and can be used as casual servers.The square boards are perfect for most applications but the longer rectangular board is good for long goods and roasts, turkeys, etc.We have tried prettier and heavier boards. They are long gone! The Cusinart PrepBoards rule in our kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential","review":"This is an absolute essential for my kitchen. I have about 8 of them. I use them as prep boards, cutting boards, and small sandwich trays and breakfast trays, etc....Can't have too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"I really like the raised edges of these boards when working with wet ingredients, like cutting tomatoes. However, the thin material of the boards warps/cups, making the board rock on its center on the counter. This combined with the slippery nature of the material itself makes for a very frustrating if not dangerous situation while chopping. The only solution I have found is to put a folded damp kitchen towel under the board to stabilize it. Frankly, that's more trouble than it's worth. For now, I am just using them for holding ingredients after I have prepped them on a better cutting board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I have two of these and we love them. I have not had any warping, slipping when cutting or chopping. I chop herbs on them and I have no problem what so ever. My life is cooking and I will not buy any other boards except these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"These little cutting boards are excellent. Ordered 2 more after finding the first one so useful. We love the fact that they solve the dripping issue and make excellent casual serving trays. Not bulky, easy cleaning and storage, what more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisinart cutting board","review":"Hey, it's just a cutting board. We've used these for years; these are replacements for some that have gotten pretty carved up. Last a L O O N G time, though. They're easy on knife edges and go through the dishwasher. They are NOT non-slip; I use a piece of shelf liner to hold them still.Very satisfactory when you need a rim around the board.

Over the last few years I've bought several copies for friends and family for various reasons.The Jemma Wakeman vocal interpratation of \\"Amazing Grace\\" is simply amazing all alone. I've learned since its release is she was sick with the flu and sang it in the low key manner because her voice wasn't at full strength. It caused her to make a piece that is one I listen to quite often.Wakeman has released many, many pieces over the years and this one is among his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute musical with unlikely singers","review":"I found this film witty and entertaining. It initially caught me off guard to hear Edward Norton and Julia Roberts singing. There are some really great sequences like the tap number in the jewelry store.It's typical cynical Woody Allen humor and if you like that and/or you like musicals, check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Woody movie & Swedish BluRay plays fine","review":"As for the movie itself it's becoming one of my favorite Woody movies (which is saying something, I'm a huge fan). The cast is great, and the movie is charming, warm and has several laugh out loud moments. But it's hard to get in the US. We already own the DVD but wanted to upgrade to Blu-Ray, but it was not available in the US. So we took a chance with this Swedish release. The Blu-Ray quality was worth the upgrade. The picture is incredible and even though this is a light musical comedy it really does add to the viewing experience. One caveat: there's no way to set subtitle preference to OFF before the movie starts (the menu options are different Scandinavian subtitles) so it will begin with Swedish subtitles. However, once the movie starts you can pause it and a menu appears which does allow you to set the subtitles to off. It's a small inconvenience for this lovely Woody movie on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Above Par","review":"All in all a brave concept, Allen manaages to pull it off somewhat. Unfortunately, the song and dance numbers seemed too numerous to allow the plot to move efficiently. Whenever the film needed to get on with the story, it would pause for a song break. Adding to the problems, Allen's screen partner Natasha Lyonne, who plays DJ, is not quite up to the challenge. I constantly found myself watching Natasha instead of DJ, and that spells trouble. Without plausible surroundings, one ends up realizing that they're watching Woody Allen instead of Joe, and that spells disaster. Still, the supporting performances were fine for the most part (especially Tim Roth and Alan Alda), and one must admire Allen for reaching back for a slice of a simpler, happier time. All in all, recommmendable, but certainly not among Allen's finer works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FINE FILM","review":"A really fine film, touching and with good performances by the actors; but at least they do their own singing, except for Drew Barrymore who apparently was not up to the task.I think this was Edward Norton's first film.I recommend it highly.By the way, how can anyone say they are reviewing a film when all the say is badaaaaahhhhh"},{"rating":"1","title":"unfinished film","review":"Although I enjoyed watching this film, it was disappointing when it abruptly stopped towards the end, the scene of the New Year's party with the \\"Groucho Marx\\" dancers.

Usually I don't mind them, but this movie grated on my nerve. I didn't even watch the movie all the way through, which is HIGHLY unlike me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woody in over his head","review":"Awkward mix of New York neuroticism and bad production numbers. Allen's propensity for making these characters such cardboard figures makes you wonder whether he truly LIKES the musical genre. Add to that the sheer chutzpah of teaming himself up romantically with Julia Roberts (AS IF!), and you've got one half-baked pastry. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone says find actors who can sing!","review":"As a film musical fan, nothing would be please me more than to bring this genre back. But when Broadway is jammed packed with killer singer dancers, why star people who can't sing or dance in a musical? This just puts more nails in the musical's coffin.This musical isn't charming, witty and represents Woody at his worst. Watch his brilliant Bullets Over Broadway instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh no times 2","review":"I had the misfortune of accidentally renting this movie twice over the space of a couple of years, not realizing it was the same one I'd seen before. I know they are saying it is a Woody Allen triumph, but I spent the whole time going \\"are you KIDDING?\\" and waiting for the good part. Both times I turned the darn thing off after about 40 minutes, so the end could be brilliant, but I would doubt it. Really hate this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and airy fun, if not deep","review":"A cute, inventive film with a couple of great musical numbers, and somefun characters (Tim Roth in particular is terrific), but lacking anysense of depth.For me, this doesn't hold up on repeated viewings nearly as well asmost Allen films. It feels more one joke on returning to it. Almostevery Allen film I've seen has only grown on me with time, withadditional layers and themes becoming evident. This was a rareexception.Still Allen's overall playful use of musical techniques makes thisworth at least one viewing. I'd still rather see a flawed work by amaster, than most of what's available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Says i Love you","review":"Love the movie.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Entertainment!","review":"Woody Allen delivers one of his finest films ever. Even though the man as an actor gets annoying after a while, I still have to give him credit where its due. The cast was incredible, even Goldie Hawn, whom I normally can't stand, was likable. Alan Alda is alwasy great, and his left wing liberal ideals clashing with his son's (played by a very funny Lucas Haas) very right wing ideals is a great joke througout. Drew Barrymore is cute as hell, Tim Roth is funny as he has ever been, and narrator Natasha Leonne (I think thats her name.)is a delight to have around. The Muscial numbers are very clever and fit in well as Woody pays homage to the classic style Hollywood Musical Comedy. Edward Norton, once again, gives a grand, impressive performance. This was NOT his first film though. Edward Norton got his start in the Richard Gere drama \\"Primal Fear\\", for which he recieved his first Academy Award nomination (and he should've won, too!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woody Allen \\"Gem\\"","review":"\\"Everyone Says I Love You\\" is probably my favorite Woody Allen film.....I'm a devoted fan for 60+ years.... the guy has so much talent in so many areas - you wouldn't go wrong purchasing some of his stuff --- I again applaud Amazon from whom I order/receive all my purchases -- they do an excellent job - giving you e-mail updates throughout the whole process -- very simple, very thorough, and the product is always A-1....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Perfect.","review":"This is a Woody Allen Romantic Musical Comedy, so I expected it to be a little more serious or have darker humor. Something like Pennies from Heaven. But it was much more like the classic musical which hasn't been made in a while but should have been.The romances may seem trite and not very well explained, and they are and I think that's intentional. There are some Allen touches, like the analyst, and the shaky relationships, but everything works out. Like in Astaire and Rogers film where their down on their luck, they stick through it and it eventually works out. A musical should entertain first and foremost, and this one did that wonderfully. My favorite part is the dancing ghosts singing \\"Enjoy Yourself\\" or Ed Norton singing \\" My Baby Just Cares for Me\\" at the ring store.The only reason it got 4 stars instead of 5 is some of the actors have weak voices and are weak dancers. But if you're not a musical theatre nut and can get past that, it's a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless, Accurate & Funny","review":"This movie is simply great. It flows incredibly well. It is paced yet fast enough. The musical numbers are long enough to enjoy, yet short enough not to get bored with and want the next scene to start already. There is a story here: It is the story of a querky family --- a family that resembles everyone's family in some form or another. You will relate at least a little. Side note: This is a film where everyone is ditzy and somewhat in space, yet they are incredibly smart. This is a world where everyone says I love you without a second thought. However, they appear to mean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, Romantic, and Overall Fun","review":"This movie was an obstacle of various kinds of love, from the deep, friendship love to the fickleness of young love. The musical aspect made it more enjoyable and the choreography augmented the fun. All the characters were unique and the actors portrayed them well. I also like the ambiguity of the ending because it lets you decide what happens, which will reflect what you think about love."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY ENTERTAINING!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Just a great blend of characters singing various musical numbers .

I really enjoyed every moment! I found myself smiling at the screen, and laughing at certain moments. I really enjoyed all of the musical numbers, and I am sure you would as well. Each musical number is put together wonderfully; the singing and dancing really are great to listen to and watch. The two numbers which stood out to me the most are when Woody Allen and Goldie Hawn are dancing together and also when Edward Norton is at the jewelery store.. just wait and you'll see! It really is a great movie to watch. I know I wouldn't mind watching it again! You can get confy and cozy and even watch it with the one you love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gem added to a long and fine catalog.","review":"I have been listening to music from this artist since the late 1997, and from Necropolis, to Riddum Warfare, to the Frieght Elevator Quartet, to The Blue series with Matthew Shipp, this artist has proven that he has few peers if any at what he does. And what DJ Spooky does is to create landscapes made from tones, ambience, and samples. Along with his own brand of turntablism DJ Spooky continues to do two important things; Elevate the state of hip-hop underground in general when everyone wants to be Fithty Cent or Trick Daddy; Help to keep the music out of the clutches of those who would do little more than glorifly the \\"thug life\\".However, it is important to also say that we have ignored genius in this culture before, I hope that the fact that we still get releases from DJ Spooky is a sign that things will get better for those in the population who need to hear genius, unfeddered by corporate greed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Background music, something diffrent","review":"This album can be pretty abstract, with it's elements of free jazz and constantly changing atmosphere.

Much like the web site, \\"Landing\\" is witty and intelligent and offers serious and disciplined approaches to marketing yourself for a new position (whether you have been fired or not). In particular, the section on resumes is critical and does in one short chapter what alot of books spend hundreds of pages reiterating. Laskoff is also insightful in his chapter on what you possibily could have done to deserve your fate in being fired; and his real life examples are informative as well as humerous. In the week since I finished the book I completely redid my resume and developed my speech for interviews (an excellent chapter also). This is a book worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for recent college grads","review":"Having graduated from a small liberal arts college last spring, I found myself with a degree and no clue what I wanted to do.

I know of one person who has found a job on the internet! It's all about networking and talking to people. Laskoff has had numerous jobs in various industries, so his advice is useful for someone who is about to enter the working world with no experience. The second section on finding a new job is obviously more pertinent to me since I've never had a full-time and therefore have never been laid-off, but I found the first section to be pretty amusing. I feel that my job search is definitely more focused and realistic after reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advice I could actually use...","review":"I am usually skeptical of books like this because they usually state the obvious and treat the reader like he/she has no common sense. But the straightforward title of this book seemed to promised a no-nonsense, practical approach to dispensing job seeking advice, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover that that was indeed the case. Laskoff presents useful, actionable, effective advice for smart adults on not only finding a new job, but dealing with the emotional, financial, and logistical ramifications of losing your old one. And it's funny! (Must check out the website...) The humorous anecdotes and Laskoff's witty style help diffuse unemployment depression, and put the reader in a lighter, more productive frame of mind.

I USED THE GRIDDLE SIDE SEVERAL TIMES BUT HAVEN'T USED THE GRILL SIDE YET. MY PANCAKES AND FRENCH TOAST COME OUT PERFECT. THE GRIDDLE CLEANS EASILY. ON THE CON SIDE, IT SEEMS TO TAKE A BIT LONG FOR THE AREA NOT OVER A BURNER TO HEAT UP BUT ONCE THAT AREA DOES HEAT UP, IT, TOO, PRODUCES A NICE, GOLDEN BROWN. MY GREATEST COMPLAINT IS THE WEIGHT OF THE GRIDDLE/GRILL. IT IS QUITE HEAVY THUS MAKING IT HARD TO HANDLE WHEN CLEANING AND STORING, ESPECIALLY FOR ME AS I STORE IT ON A SHELF THAT IS OVER MY HEAD SO LIFTING IT TO THE SHELF TAKES A GOOD BIT OF STRENGTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is a great product. Fits beautifully across 2 burners and clean up is a snap. Had a gang over the weekend and the french toast was flying off the griddle.

It's nice when everyone can eat together and not have to WAIT for their slice of french toast, or pancake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't heat evenly on gas stove tops","review":"I've tried several times letting this griddle preheat slowly over a low to medium flame for up to 15 minutes, but there are always cold spots between the burners and hot spots directly over the burners. The temperature difference is quite extreme and if you have a 4\\" pancake half way between it will be both burnt and raw. The other LL pro cast iron cookware I have purchased has worked quite well. Maybe it does better on the bbq???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived with bubbling, peeling surface....twice.","review":"I was very excited to receive this griddle after reading all of the positive reviews.Upon arrival, the first thing I noticed was that a big black bubble on the cooking surface. I touched it with my finger and it tore off, exposing the bare iron beneath.I tried to cook with it anyways, knowing that I was going to send it back for a replacement.I made pancakes in the morning and burgers at night. The results were a mixed bag.The surface may be slightly non-stick, but it's certainly not on par with a high quality non-stick surface. My pancakes stuck even though I slightly greased the surface. It performed poorly for pancakes.Dinner was a different story. Cooking burgers on this thing is a dream. No complaints there.My second griddle just arrived today. There are multiple big cooking surface bubbles on this one. Maybe Amazon got a bad batch, maybe Lodge Logic's quality has fallen off. Either way, I recommend avoiding this griddle."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best idea ever!","review":"I have a 36\\" gas range and oven and this Grill/Griddle fits perfect over two of the burners. It lays completely flat and does not wobble. Upon receiving it today, I immediately decided to cook a hotdog on the grill. Wow. While grilling the hotdog I placed the bun over the back area of the grill where it was just staying warm. I've decided to leave it over the two buners as it's permanent home, as it's just my husband and myself! If I should need to use more than two burners for cooking, I'll just move it off and put it right back after the meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Cast Iron Grill","review":"So far I have really enjoyed cooking with the grill. I grilled veggies, fish and even grilled pineapple-delicious. If you are not a cooking enthusiast, this grill is heavy and you'll need to wait until the grill is completely cool before cleaning, but if you love to cook, this grill is worth it. I wipe the grill clean then rinse it in hot water (Never use soap) and sometimes use a soft cloth to get off any stubbborn food, but it really wipes off easily. I dried the grill, coat it with a thin layer of vegetable oil and store it in the box it came in. It really is easy to maintain. If you shop around, like I did, you will find Amazon has the best price for this item. I gave this item 4*'s because it is heavy, but the quality is outstanding. I should also mention I have an electric stove, which works very good, but if you have a gas stove this is best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for omelets, etc. without toxic teflon","review":"It's worth the extra weight.

I was hoping I would love this too. I don't.Pros:It does cook satisfactorily.Cons:Burner edges peek out from either end of this griddle. It doesn't cover the burners well (left/right or up/down).Significant pre-heating required to use.Burner settings are very high to get a decent cooking temperature.Temperature on the surface is uneven no matter what the burner settings.(Worst problem) It discolors the stove top cooking surface requiring elbow grease and soapy steel scouring pads to clean. No amount of stove cleaning has fixed this problem.This griddle may work well for gas stoves or barbecue grills, but I don't know. It does not work well for my electric stove top. I am going to buy some heat diffusers and give this griddle another try. I do not have high hopes.Update: 2/11/2012 - Heat diffusers improved performance only very slightly, but not enough to rate another star.

We made a skirt steak last week and it was as good as one cooked on the Weber. after eating non-stick surface for years, I'll never ever go back to non-stick. It's useless and doesn't last. This griddle will last forever. It's a quick learning process as to how to maintain your cast iron. It's worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this griddle","review":"This was just what I was looking for!

I needed maybe 1/4 inch more. Back to searching for one that will fit. Otherwise - it had good weight, loved that you could flip and have another cooking surface. There was a collection/bubble of the commercial finish they applied on one of the corners - I think it was just a fluke that mine had that, but....thought I would put it out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, heavy, ready to go","review":"I used it right out of the box after cleaning and oiling.

Make sure you have your heat gloves on,or know where the BURN UNIT is in your town.Great Product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely hard to clean","review":"I've used iron skillets for years, but this one is particularly hard to clean. The grooves that allow you to get really nice grill marks also serve to keep you from cleaning well. If you use any marinade, such as BBQ sauce, orange juice, or vinegar based sauces, that marinade will eat away part of the seasoning. That happens with any iron skillet or pan, but with the exposed grooves, it's really bad. Also, it's difficult to scrub where the grooves meet the pan, because it's a 90 degree angle. So, if you don't mind scrubbing down to iron and needing to reseason each time you use the griddle, it'll work well.It's a substantial piece of cooking equipment. I have gas burners, and it heats evenly enough to be useful. I like the fact that I can have some cooler sections of the cooking top (cooler, but still very hot). I can see alot of uses for this griddle and maybe the flat top is better to clean. However, the problem cleaning the grill top means it's not useful for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves it!","review":"My husband wanted an electric griddle. I didn't want one more appliance to clutter the pantry. I bought him this and he loves it! It sits nicely on the gas stove and fits in the storage drawer on the stove.

Lodge is all we ever used when I was growing up and it is still my go-to frying pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"could have a deeper lip","review":"I'm a big fan of cast iron as a whole. This two sided griddle is great, especially on a wood burning stove with it's uniform heat source. When laid across 2 burners on the stovetop you'll have some temperature differentials, plan accordingly. The one complaint I have has to do with the exterior lip. It should be deeper on the griddle side. When cooking bacon for scouts the grease trap fills up too fast. It should also have a pouring lip for the grease trap."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer my electric skillet","review":"I bought this to replace an existing cast iron skillet based on the rave reviews. After months of trying, I have never been able to cook anything well. I thought it was just me so I had others try and they had the same reaction. I know I only need low heat because at medium heat anything I put on it smoked up the house, but anything from pancakes to chicken breasts came out inconsistent or stuck on the pan. After only a few months I have many rust spots despite cleaning it with a steel grill brush and drying it by hand. I replaced mine with a $30 electric skillet and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware - NOT pre-seasoned","review":"This is my first experience with Lodge brand cast iron and honestly, it's been a rough weekend!

It makes the most uniform pancakes, grilled cheese, and french toast I ever made. I have a 6 burner gas cooktop and I wish it were just a little bit longer to really overlap both burners.

I have a healthy collection of frying pans and a pots, but I was still using my old Black & Decker electric griddle for Sunday breakfasts. This Lodge cast iron griddle fits perfectly on my stove pot. There is no movement at all during normal use. This thing weighs a ton! Heats evenly and arrived like other Lodge pieces pre-seasoned and ready for action. My only complaint is that cleaning the griddle side can be a bit of a chore if you let the food sit on it after it's cool. A stiff OXO brush when the griddle is still a bit warm is the easiest way to tackle the chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than a lifetime","review":"Traded in my lightweight stovetop grill for this heavy duty - very heavy - grill. Can't beat cast iron if you treat it well. This takes a half hour to heat up; equally to cool, so cook accordingly. It's a beauty that you can bequeath to your great grandchild. You do have to season it yourself although it says it's pre-seasoned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pancakes & french toast","review":"We use this griddle ALL the time! We turn to this heavy duty griddle whenever we are cooking up pancake/french toast for the family. It sits right on top of our gas range & we are able to cook 2 pancakes at once. We have tried the other side for burgers, but prefer to use a flat pan instead. The rippled griddle side is more time consuming to clean up than a flat pan. Love that nothing sticks to it. Would definately purchase again---as matter of fact--I have purchased it again as a gift for another family member!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creates good food, takes some getting use to... smokey","review":"This grill works great, especially when it is cold outside. You really have to keep an eye on it however. Once you heat it up it will take a long time to cool down. If you get it too hot you are in danger of burning. I keep one side cooler than the other. I have done breakfast, lunch and diner. I have done beef, chicken, veg burgers, vegetables, eggs, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, bacon, ham, no fish yet. Don't over-crowd it. You will have to plan for larger groups. You may want to stick with your Teflon. That is easier, but less fun/ satisfying. If you get it too hot and it will smoke you out. I think it should have a little more tilt to the reservoir. Have some dedicated clothe rags and scrubbers to clean. Difficult cleaning is a negative on this and it is very heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent griddle","review":"We rarely have used it as a grill, but have used it as a griddle hundreds of times.

Thanks LODGE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Proper Care Can Turn You into an Indoor Grilling Guru","review":"I bought this thing because, to be honest, I never grilled before and I didn't want my first attempt to be a major public fail. My first attempt was marinated chicken breast and I NEVER had chicken that good before in my life! Anywho, enough of the backstory. If you follow the instructions and just take proper care of it, this overlay grill will give you a whole new dimension of indoor cooking prowess. One small drawback is that the instructions weren't very detailed about how re-seasoning is actually done. Hopefully I know a retired chef from a 5-star steak house who told me you don't even need to heat it to re-season it. Just spray it down with cooking oil, wipe off the excess, and you're done.This wonderful device has been highly instrumental to learning how to make Rotel turkey burgers and they've always turned out delicious. I am officially done with fast food now. :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great grill until it Cracked","review":"I have owned this grill for about one year and have enjoyed using it for steak, chicken and burgers. It was used only about once or twice per month. Unfortunately, today it developed a large crack while pre-heating.

This brings the cooking surface down to 16.5, which on a Viking stove means you can only cover about 75% of each burner. It works on a viking, but not very efficiently and with the added bonus of having flames shoot up through the handles.I love my other Lodge pans and I'm sure this is of equal quality, it's just not suited for larger cook tops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but heavy","review":"I bought this about four years ago and have used it several times. It fits over two burners and cooks well. I only gave it four stars because it is so heavy, which is a common trait for all cast iron products. I really do love cast iron, but this is a bit hard to clean properly because of its size and weight. I have since purchased a smaller cast iron grill and a separate griddle. Since there is only two of us, these works better for most applications. I do recommend that you season it before using it and after each time it is used. After washing, I put it on a medium heat, coat it lightly with oil using a paper towel, let it heat for a few minutes, then wipe it clean and cool it down before storing it again. When I have used the procedure that Lodge recommends, my cast iron has become gummy. This works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Electric Ranges","review":"I would not recommend this product for electric ranges where you are covering two different size burners and need to get even consistant heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to use and clean","review":"I was so excited about the dual griddle/ grill feature, but I do not like this pan one bit.

The only issue I have had with the griddle is getting it to sit proper and level from front to back. IT CAN BE DONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product. Teflon free.","review":"I have been using cast iron frying pan for cooking for some time and recently replaced my electric Teflon griddle with this cast iron griddle. I am happy with it and would recommend it.I used it only for pancakes on my ceramic stove top. Some people are concerned with cracking the stove top or uneven heat. So far, I don't have problem with it as long as you have a heating element between the two round element to create an oblong heat surface, you should be okay.I usually preheat my griddle in the oven at 350 and start creating the pancake batter, so by the time the batter is done, the griddle is evenly heated. I had issues with fingering out how hot the griddle should be but after 2 attempts, I think I have mastered it. My word of advice, lower heat is better since you'd rather have less cooked pancake (which you can turn up the heat more) than to have burnt pancakes.All in all, I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been using this grill/griddle for several months now. I love it! I use it at least 3 - 4 times a week (sometimes more). I love cooking on the outdoor grill but this is a wonderful alternative if it is cold or rainy outside. I owned a George Foreman grill for years but I found that one side of the meat would always cook quicker than the other side (maybe it was just my grill). I also thought that it was a pain to clean. This is easy to clean because you can submerge it in water and you can let it soak if you have to. Also, make sure you let it heat up for at least 10 minutes before placing your food on it. I found that if I did this, the heat distributes evenly and the food placed between the burners will cook just was well as the food over the burners. My next purchase is going to be the Lodge Grill Press. Oh, and I use this on my glass top stove and I have not had any problems. Just handle carefully when putting it on and taking it off of the glass top stove."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not like me for anything","review":"This palncha is very heavy and difficult to clean, in addition it oxidizes, for my it was a bad(wrong) choice(election)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best grill/griddle around...","review":"I just received my griddle last week and I've been using it daily with excelent results every time. Mine arrived with a few minor scratches on the preseasoning but all of them seem to be disappearing quite soon (I spray a little pam all over the griddle before using it). I cooked some hamburgers on the grill side which turned out delicious and they got those great grill marks on them also. I've had no sticking problems at all with this thing so far. Cleanup is easy providing you have a stiff brush, a large sink and the strong arms required to carry it from the stove to the sink every time you wash it (this thing weighs 15 pounds). I highly recommend this griddle to anyone, it's very well constructed and looks like it will last a lifetime with proper care."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Pancake King","review":"Great size to fit over two burners. Perfect for Grandpa, the Pancake King. Well made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grill/Griddle","review":"This is exactly what I was looking for. Very heavy, but I knew that and expected it. I love cooking with cast iron because there are no harmful toxins from non-stick coatings. The pre-seasoning is pretty good, didn't have to season it myself. But it is getting better and better with each use. If you care for it properly, it will be so non-stick that all you have to do to clean it is scour it under hot water and the water will bead up and roll off. Mine already does and I've only had it about a month. We leave it out on our gas stovetop all the time and use it frequently. We dry it after washing by turning on the gas under it until the water evaporates and then put a light coat of oil on it and rub it in with a paper towel to coat. Great purchase if you like cast iron cookware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Like others, I tried high end non-stick grill/griddles before I purchased this one. Started out great, but before long the non-stick stuck! Can't believe how much better this grill and griddle works! The heat is far more evenly distributed so I'm able to use most of the surface for cooking. Nothing sticks and cleanup is a breeze! Great grill marks. Use it most days for everything from eggs and pancakes to fajitas and tortillas! Yes, it's heavy -- but I've added lifting it from the bottom drawer of my stove to my workout regimen. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great non stick but not milled flat","review":"The Pro 20-by-10 from Lodge works very well. It is way more non-stick than plastic coated pans and came well seasoned. I was hoping for a milled smooth surface like my older cast iron pans but it was left as it came out of the sand casting material. This does not seem to change the non stick properties.I just fixed hash browns, sausage and eggs for two all at once and everything lifted right of the griddle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Griddle","review":"I have been using this griddle for a couple of weeks. I am truely amazed at how easy it is to clean, how very little food sticks to it.I purchased it primarily for making pancakes after our electric gridle kept flaking off non stick surface.

It stays put while trying to cook on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far not bad","review":"We only used it once camping to cook bacon. Not a good Idea to cook it on the ribbed side.

I like it a lot, but it doesn't quite cover two burners on my gas stove, and I wanted a bit larger cooking area. I ordered this grill, which supposedly has a 20\\"x10.5\\" cooking surface. In actuality, it has a smaller cooking surface than my other grill. It's true the total dimensions of this new grill are 20\\"x10.5\\", but there is a drainage channel along the long edge, and two handles along the short ends, which bring the cooking surface down to 16\\"x8.5\\". So, it's larger and heavier to wash and handle, and costs more, for a smaller cooking surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!","review":"Lodge Logic LPGI3 Pro 20-by-10-7/16-Inch Cast-Iron Grill/Griddle is a great boon to my cooking. I also have a Lodge frying pan and a dutch oven.Do NOT assume that because the manufacturer says it's \\"pre-seasoned\\", that it's OK to use it right out of the box. I knew better but I got impatient, tried that and things stuck. Take the time to properly season it and you've got a great grill/griddle. I'm very picky about getting perfect bacon and eggs over-easy every time. My secret is to put the bacon on a cold griddle, light the burners, turn the fire down as low as it will go, and let it cook slowly.The fried eggs are started after the bacon has created a little grease for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THE GRIDDLE","review":"I've been wanting a cast iron griddle for some time.

This sits on top of the stove and is perfect for grilling steaks, sausage, corn, and just about anything else. I also use this product on top of the stove in the house, but because it browns so well it creates some smoke. I just open a window and put on a fan and the smoke detectors don't go off. The reverse side of this is a griddle and it makes perfect pancakes. Because it's cast iron, it holds the heat allowing for it to be used repeatedly with no recovery time needed. The price was awesome and the company Lodge Logic makes many other cast iron products that I am soon to buy.

You also can flip it over and wipe off the soot and cook burgers on the other side! The grease slot at the end is also very helpful while cooking burgers or bacon.I have no real negative comments for this item.You will like this if you are car camping or just want a great griddle for cooking.

This CD is full of painful ballads and horrible lyrics and deserves a negative rating if that were possible.I also considered Nuno one of the best (if not the best) guitarists in the world... but after this and his previous solo effort(s) (he's dressed as a girl on the cover on one CD), not to mention Mourning Widows, he's really lost whatever magic he once commanded. Sadly, at least Jason Becker had a good reason for his fade. He has set aside all that made him great - playing the guitar.As far as the other raters go - stop lying to the public! Nuno WAS one of the greatest guitarists, but that Nuno seems to be dead. Don't buy this CD without first hearing samples of the abysmal tracks first. Buyer beware!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Nuno?","review":"It seems that Nuno.. one of the best guitarists of all-time, has forgotten how to play guitar. Not good stuff.. not at all. (...)I used to listen to a song with Nuno in it and I was like..(...), there's a month out of my life trying to learn one song!\\" Now.. I hear this new stuff and I'm confident I could learn every song all in one day. How a musician can have every song be so good on every album... form a different group and have every song sound awful, I will never know... quite strange. The melody is gone.. and the cool riffs are no more. If you want to hear Nuno, save your money here and go buy some old Extreme CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"A music fan from the U.S. has no clue, (read his review) he says there isnt any guitar in the first song, WRONG, there is. Sorry if you had to read his review Nuno, I know what I'm talking about. The only people that won't like this is someone without any taste. If you want to listen to someone that can't even write their own music then this album is'nt for you. The only thing that could be better is if Nuno and Gary did an album togeather. I would love to work with you Nuno.A great album, another Nuno Great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different This Time Around","review":"Nuno takes a different approach with his new CD Population 1. The really are not any funky grooves, no great solos, nothing that sounds like Mourning Widows or Extreme. The CD starts off with Flow a song with no guitar at all and then goes in to Spaceman a bluesy sounding thing with bad lyrics. High is one of the few bright spots on this CD it has some heaver guitars and a pretty cool groove. Un Happy B-Day has to be the worst thing Nuno has ever written, it sounds like a bad Prince song.I have been a Nuno fan since the first Extreme record and I tried to like it but I just can't. If none of us waste our 30 dollars this time around maybe Nuno will remeber he is a guitar player next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - Could do Better","review":"First of all, this is a good album. But that's the problem. It's good - not great. Population 1 is nowhere near the genius of Schizophonic, and is a bit of a let down. Make no mistake, there are some great songs on this album, but there's also too much in-depth, look-at-me-I-am-serious-artist type songs which lets it down.It'll take a while to like it, but it will grow on you. The sooner Extreme egt back together the better, that's what I say!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best production and voice but not Nuno's best album !","review":"This album sounds very different from the others albums. It's sound like a mix of the first Mourning Widows album, Schizophonic and the Waiting for the punchline album. Flow, Space, High (Waiting for the punchline sounding) Iron Jaw, Ordinary day (Confrontation sounding)are some of the tracks here worth listening to but the best songs to my mind are Unhappy Birthday and Stiff. Very weird and original songs.Very Good album but not his best album.

I'm sold on the concept though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Steamer/Cooker - With a Major Flaw","review":"I've had this steamer for almost a year now and it has proven to be sturdy. I use it primarily for veggies, but have used it for chicken, fish, and bacon. I don't recommend using it for bacon, as it will warp the insert. I like the slide covered vent in the cover.In the picture on Amazon it appears the cover has a tab on it to aid in removing the lid. This is not the case. The lid fits into a groove in the base quite snugly. This is good for cooking, but makes it a bit difficult to remove the cover when it is hot out of the microwave. The major defect is this: if you want to use it as a regular cooking dish, without the steamer insert you will find the cover doesn't fit, but balances on the rim. The insert sits on the lip of the dish and the aforemetioned groove in the steaming insert is the same size as the dish rim. IMO this is a major design flaw.Because of the two issues with the cover I wouldn't buy this again."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad product","review":"I sent this as a gift.

Like most studio apartments in NYC area it's so tiny, it's the location not the size of the apartment that's pricey , anyway , having a small space with limited time and still want to eat healthy this was a godsend! Depending on the size of of salmon or any fish, the cooking is fast. all i do is buy frozen cut salmon or fresh one, then, coat it with olive oil and spices, squeeze fresh lemon on it and add 2 or one slice of lemon and sprigs of dill or thyme or both just as the recipe calls for, and the outcome... DELISHHHHHHHHH! It's so moist yet cooked! I recommend it , hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this product","review":"I consider myself a pretty good cook, but don't claim to be a microwave master. I've used this steamer twice and it has ruined the food both times - brocoli and asparagus. I followed the instructions on the lame instruction 3x5 slip of paper included in the package. Both times the food was inedible. Don't be fooled by the cheap price. The shipping costs twice as much. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good steamer, but one little problem.","review":"Good steamer. But the tray absorbs both short-term odor (salmon) and stains (yams).

Next time will purchase the brand I know that I can trust instead of trying new ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is a piece of crap","review":"This is a piece of garbage. I used it once to microwave steam vegetables and the damn thing warped. Neither the insert nor the cover will now fit back on the base. It is now useless and will be thrown out with the trash.It should also be noted that I also ordered the Nordic brand version of the microwave veggie/fish steamer and it works beautifully. It has not warped with use and it cooks the food wonderfully.My experience has shown that Progressive microwave cookware is junk while Nordic is a reliable brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Go this one to replace a broken Nordicware steamer.

Ended up throwing it in trash since all veggies cooked in there smelled like plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use enough water and it works great!!","review":"Some of the other reveiws I read said to use 2 Tbl of water in the bottom. If you do this your veggies will be rubbery and gross. I finally figured out to put about a 1/4 of an inch of water in the bottom, put the microwave power to 6 and cook for about 3 min. Then I finally got something that was edible. Easy to clean and convenient once you find how to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major Help for Healthful Eating","review":"If I could keep only 3 cooking vessels, this steamer would make the cut. It's darn near foolproof (the \\"fool\\" being kitchen-inept me), quick & easy to clean. It makes healthful eating much easier. As with virtually everything microwave, you'll likely need to play around a bit to learn YOUR cooking times.This steamer handles fresh & frozen veggies with equal efficacy. The only fish I've cooked in it is salmon and it works well for that too. I've been using mine about a year, and think it's worth twice the price. In fact, I bought two. That way I can cook my salmon in one, then immediately cook veggies in the other; no washing in between.ONE POSSIBLE DOWNSIDE: It holds small amounts; about two three-inch-wide salmon strips, and enough veggies to satisfy one voracious vegetable lover like me, or two less greedy eaters. Perfect & practical for a single person, as I am. But you might want to think twice if you're cooking for more than two.I highly recommend this steamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice lid","review":"My daughter wanted a cast iron skillet for Christmas and I thought it would be nice to throw in the lid as well.

First, the biggest problem was oxidation. After washing the lid and left it in the drying rack, I noticed red residue all over on the inside of the lid. This happens every time i'd used it, and it was disgusting. I stopped using it and decided to return it. The other problem was that the handle conducts heat!!!! It gets way too hot to lift up the lid and one needs to use a mitten to do that. I got a new lid made of glass and it's got a heat resistant plastic handle that's much better. Overall, this is an ill thought product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Lid","review":"Well, how do you rate a lid?!

Most offerings in this genre resemble a well picked over smorgasbord in which one finds a few good tips among acres of wilted lettuce. What remains of the main course, conflict creation, resolution and character development is incoherently scattered among the weeds. Cleaver gets it right by giving us a complete road map to writing, self-editing and publishing fiction. He shows how to convert your onmiscient narrator essays into scenes and dialogue that drive the plot, develop character(and keep the reader's attention), how to replace those \\"telling\\" images of emotion(e.g.,\\"icy stab in the stomach\\") with \\"showing\\" the emotion through thought and dialogue.

All the other writers writing about writing make it seem like such a mystery. So elusive and impossible I was sure I'd never get there, because I couldn't read the sign-posts (oh, I hope I'm not being overly metaphorical). But read this book and try to tell me I'm wrong: this is not vague and mysterious, but on the contrary--straightforward, and yes, to the point!

Not every song on this album is a knockout, but a couple of them, \\"Souvenir\\" in particular, are really, really powerful, with Moreland doing some fine work on what is probably the most memorable song here. There's definitely a JN spin on this album, but Moreland added a lot of depth to it and it's a shame they didn't do more work together before his untimely death a few years back. It's definitely worth tracking down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which one is Pretty n twisted","review":"Came upon this album recently and I am sad to find it slipped through the cracks. An under-rated masterwork by Johnette Napolitano and Marc Moreland. What Concrete Blonde could have veered into, but slipped off of in Mexican Moon. Dark landscapes and humor tinged music thruout. The inspired Janis Joplin lyric driven and haunting music can't help but sway and move you. The Stranger takes you for a ride. Billy the queen gives us shades of Johnettes time in Hollywood. Ride mesmerizes. Pretty and Twisted is an apropos title. Just wish tragedy hadn't befallen this experimental group and had it soar more."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty damn good!","review":"Marc Moreland is a true animal on guitar, showing off his talent constantly. This is one album you do NOT want to miss out on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lance like you've never seen him before, but . . .","review":"Unfortunately, this is a derivative, poorly scripted bit of straight-to-video schlock. Its only value lies in the novelty of seeing Lance Henriksen as a slightly sinister womanizer (with some softcore sex scenes to boot). Pity that Mr. H only gets about 37 minutes of screen time. Co-star Joan Severance has been better in any number of other features, but she has little to work with in this script. The story is predictable (you'll know who the killer is well before anyone in the story figures it out). The characters behave in ways that serve the plot without making sense. The dialogue is terrible--neither smart nor sexy (what you can hear of it between the poor sound editing and the lousy music). This film will only interest serious fans of Lance Henriksen or Joan Severance. If you're looking for a smartly done, sexy mystery/thriller . . . keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tried Others - this is the best Doumbek CD out there -","review":"this is a great cd and overall series. I've tried other cd including some of the great Masters....however, this cd is excellent for taking a beginner fast through the rythms, plus uses humor, plus uses a classroom environment so you can see others trying out the techniques, struggling with them, getting victorious over them, etc., which is a great encourage-builder.Plus there are bonuses at the end of each cd that includes jam sessions that allow you to just freestyle it and have fun.Well done and I've already purchased the beginnermediate cd and look forward to purchasing the advanced editions. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An fair introduction to the subject","review":"This book is a reasonbale first read for those who know little about spying, the world of intellegence and what it could be used for in the real (not cloak and dagger) world. The main emphasis is on how spying techniques (not illegal ones, mind you) can be applied in business, though this is not a book of tradecraft - the author repeated says that corporate human intellegence should be left to professionals. Given the serious financial reprecussions of violating one's non-disclosure agrements, I'd say that's good advice. A good read, skip the war stories if the topic at hand isn't of that much interest to you personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"CIA INC, Business Intelligence Primer","review":"I profited from studying the book. The book presented easy to follow intelligence principles and methods with unique complementary stories. The discussion of business intelligence, recruitment of spies, legal issues, source protection, CIA case officer, targeting, employee vulnerabilities, importance of in-depth background investigations and terrorism was informative, enlightening and helpful. The book showed the dangers, failures, successes and trade craft problems that exist in the intelligence and business community. It give examples from Vietnam era to present day situations. An innocent, who knew no better, would gain insightful information for survival in the world of intelligence.The book came across as sincere and truthful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Logic Cast Iron Fajita Servers on Amazon","review":"This is an excellent product, and the price makes it even better. I ordered two of them, and received them just as I was pan-frying some pork chops. I put these servers in the oven for 30 minutes at 425, and then put my just-finished pork chops on the servers, which kept the pork chops hot until the last bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presentation Only","review":"For some reason, I thought fajitas were actually grilled on skillets like these until I read the directions, which state to warm this up in the oven and use it for presenting meat/veggies that are presumably cooked on other cookware. Had I realized that (the other reviews make sense to me *now* that I've read the directions), I am not too sure I would have bought this. Function over form, and all that ...That said, I'm still giving it 5 stars because the Lodge cast iron quality is so amazing. The wooden tray is great, and the handle mitt is nice (slightly cheesy pattern, but I can overlook it). I'll enjoy fajitas with this for sure. I may even try to cook directly on this! (Well, maybe not ...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"For fajitas, try the 8\\" skillet instead","review":"I considered buying this skillet for many weeks until I discovered the Lodge Logic 8\\" skillet is better suited as a personal pan for fajitas. Sure, this pan with its handle cover and wood base is a nice novelty, but not practical for serving fajitas. First of all, you can't actually cook the onions and peppers on this skillet without them falling off the side. But the 8\\" pan is great for frying up the onions and peppers and seasonings. You can then throw in the chicken from the barbecue grill when it's ready and serve the personal 8\\" pan to your guests. NOTE: the pan will need some kind of heat proof mat or wood to set on. We use little bamboo cutting boards. I guess you could fry up all the ingredients in a large pan and then serve them on the pre-heated fajita set, but who has the space and time to go to all this trouble? Besides, the 8\\" skillet can hold more of everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking objective analysis...Did he get paid for writing this???","review":"Brode tries to argue in his book that Disney and the company are very liberal and socialist. He writes that Disney actually favored socialism over captialism, and that Disney created movies to entertain the masses. He also statees that the Disney company was the catalyst for the student protests of the sixties. The book reads as if he was instructed by a PR person from Disney; he leaves out every criticism ever published. According to him, there are not racial or gender issues promoted in the animated films. His arguments, however, seem lame and sometimes far-fetched. This cannot be seen as a trustworthy, academic secondary source about Disney and the company!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Oil album out of a large catalog","review":"This is an incredible album from a very talented band known in the U.S. for their one hit \\"Beds Are Burning\\". If you are a fan of just that one song this album may not be for you. It does include a little pop sensiblity in the way of \\"When The Generals Talk\\" and \\"Who Can Stand In The Way\\", but most of the albums has strange indigineous Australian instruments as well as some great orchestration. Songs like \\"Bells...\\" and \\"Shipyards Of New Zealand\\" have constant time changes and varieties of music styles within the songs themselves. It is not a perfect album with small flaws such as the strange instrumental \\"Bakerman\\" which does however fit into the flow of this weird album. Overall, it is possibly the best Midnight Oil album out there and that's saying a lot about a band that has such a large and impressive catalog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative CD from MO","review":"Inventive,creative,innovative are just a few adjectives that come to mind describing this effort from MO. While some critics call it a dry album Garret's vocals are anything but. He's no Luciano Pavoratti but he definitley has his own distinct style and easily recognizable vocals...They defied or avoided being stigmatized by trends or fads of the 80's. As an Aussie rock group Midnight Oil set their own style and unique footsteps !It's all good fun for musical fans and non-fans alike..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overproduced","review":"I would rate most Midnight Oil albums 5 stars. Not so this one. It has some good songs which are ruined by heavy-handed production in the studio and too much commercial slickness. Hello! Midnight Oil is a great band because of their raw rock sound coupled with savvy on-target political commentary. This album just does not work because the raw edge is gone, replaced with slickness that even veers into (somebody has to say it) disco influences on a couple of tracks. Only one great track - \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" - is up to the usual par one expects from the Oils."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to spacy and weird for me","review":"As a long time fan of Midnight Oil, this CD is very surprising to me. 'Red Sail in the Sunset' is a release that is so un- Midnight Oilish. There is no method to the songs and in no order so the CD sounds spacy and weird. Makes me wonder what Peter Garrett and members were doing whilst recording this CD. Only one song stands out in this release and that is 'Kosciusko'. The rest of the songs are forgettable and I know this CD will be the least played album in my home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"On the heels of 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1, this one is quite a bit different but nonetheless a classic. Variety adds spice to life and on this release the Oils expand thier sound a bit more. The slow burn of \\"Jimmy Sharman's Boxers\\" is brillant as well as the energy found in \\"Best of Both Worlds\\" and \\"Kosciousko\\". A bit darker and brooding than its predecessor, it is nonetheless brilliant, melodic, powerful, and moving. A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of Many Genres","review":"Few musicians qualify as \\"master\\" of any genre. Bela Fleck joins Benny Goodman as one who qualifies as a master of many -- Blue Grass, Jazz, Classical. Any album associated with the name \\"Fleck\\" is worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music.","review":"This album features some true instrumental monsters, namley Bela Fleck and Victor Wooten. But let us not forget the stellar contributions of Edgar Meyer, Jerry Douglas, Bruce Hornsby, Tony Rice, Mat Mundy, Sam Bush, Chick Corea, Future Man, Branford Marsalis....the list goes on. This is an extremley tasteful album, the songs are like classical arrangements with heavy infusions of jazz and bluegrass. It is a tantilizing combination that keeps you interested through out the entire album, from start to finish. I highly recomend this album along with Vol. 2 (which is much more bluegrassy, but still very good)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another childhood memory","review":"I'm looking forward to the day this wonderful series is brought to DVD.

Most are written from a more litturgical perspective, giving great arguments for the benefit and theories behind family oriented worship, but little practical advice for a more modern worship context. However, this book really helped give me some tools for making the sermon (lets face it, the hardest element for kids to connect with) more kid inclusive. I love that the goal is not to pander to kids or to give then a \\"childrens' sermon\\" that is seperate from the \\"real sermon\\", but to give them connecting points to the sermon that reinforces the truth that the sermon is for them too. Preaching to the entire family takes an incredible amount of creativity. You Can Preach to the Kids Too! helped build a framework for more practical, kid friendly sermons.

I have to say that her heroine was not a very endearing character. Okay, so she's not very talented when it comes to using her gift, but she had the amulet left to her by her mother, couldn't she make good use of it? Also, I find it hard to believe that she almost willingly gave this amulet to Sir Colin for \\"safe keeping\\"! Come on! Where's the common sense? And why did she not think of wishing her attire to fit the time period she was in? Why continue wearing your 20th century pajamas?

It was good and all, but I couldn't quite identify with the heroine. She seemed determined to thwart her common sense. When she did things rationally this was a really good book. And, even if you did not like this one, you should read another, because most of Teresa's Books are very good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so enchanting","review":"When I read the back cover, I was intrigued. It was fairly good until about 2/3 through. Then it just got completely ridiculous. There were some silly parts previously, but I could turn a blind eye.

The hero is strong, brave, sensible, tender, caring - someone you would want to step out of the pages of the book into your life. The heroine, however, is more often than not irritating in her stupidity, alternating between being a empty-headed woman and a preschool child. If you are comparing this book with other romances, it was okay. It had some promise, but Tabitha still fell into the empty-headed female category. If you are comparing this book with another time travel novel written - Outlander by Diana Gabaldon, it really wasn't worth the money paid or the time invested in reading it. Diana Gabaldon is the only author I have come across who can portray an intelligent heroine to match her fantastic hero.

This was a gift and the shippers decised the box so he had no Idea what it was.

I have used other older cast iron such as Griswold and they are really seasoned. This is not and I don't know how one of their non-seasoned cast iron pieces would work, but it can't stick any more than this. In order to get it clean it must be scrubbed and whatever seasoning it had is removed. I guess I will have to season it my self although I have tried cleaning without soap and adding oil to it afterwards and it hasn't improved. If you really want a good cast iron piece of cookware, find an old one and invest the money in that."},{"rating":"2","title":"lodge camp oven","review":"just received my camp oven in australia and i am very happy with the quality of the oven, i would recommend lodge camp ovens to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Iron is great","review":"This is my second Lodge 8qt Dutch Oven.

I've fed 6 adults and 4 kids cobbler with left-overs. This oven does not have hot spots, and I've had no problem maintaining the 'seasoning'. I highly recommend the lid lifter, lid stand, and trivet.

Dude, give it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst album so far","review":"Coming from a big eminem fan I expected this to be great, like his last 3 albums which seemed to progress in terms of quality. But as he was featured in songs with 50 cent and others before this album dropped, his lyrical delivery style or flow seemed to have changed, almost to a wanna be tupac style, almost whiney at times. Practically the only song that has a good flow from eminem on encore is \\"Mockingbird\\". If this cd has flows like that with the same exact beats I would easily rate it with 4 stars. \\"Mosh\\" is clearly the best track, which has a good flow, good beat, and good focus. Other than that song it seems repetitive. His chorus' are weak and corny and last too long. He obviously still possesses the same lyrical skills but this isn't a cd that you can love almost any track on (like the previous 3). Overall, you can look at this as a good cd but compared to his previous efforts it is definitely weak in comparison...by far"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"There is one obsessed fan that has posted over 200 5 star reviews for this lame cd because he wants to keep the rating up.

I listened to it and thought it was kind of boring. I never thought Emeinem was that good to me. He just seemed really trashy, and his hooks were weak.Compared to alot of other black rappers. I do think he's came out with better stuff now. Toy soldier was pretty good. I really like his cover of Martika's Song, and it is my 2nd favorite Emeinem song.

But of them all, I enjoy cooking with this griddle the most.The advantage of the griddle over the frying pan is that it weighs less, thus not requiring two hands to pick it up or to manoeuver it on the stove, even when it contains food.It also seems to heat more quickly and evenly. And as an added bonus, the lid that fits the skillet and the Dutch Oven also fits this griddle, although I think the lid weighs as much or more than the griddle itself.Of course, you need to use the right tool for the job. So the frying pan may be more appropriate for whatever you are cooking and thus it is more versatile. But when I have a choice, I find myself reaching for this griddle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Logic Round Griddle","review":"Great addition to my cooking utensils. Have used it many times.

I was a little nervous about food sticking, but I had absolutely no issues. I love cast iron, no more Teflon for me. Clean up was easy, just a quick wipe with a paper towel.

And, with proper care & recurring seasoning, it will last several lifetimes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent","review":"Works pretty good-needs more seasoning.

I bought it to use for the Artisan bread in the oven at high temp. and it works great for that too. It's plenty big for those small loaves, and much more economical than a pizza stone for that purpose. It's lighter weight too which is a plus for me.

I have cooked bacon, chicken, and blackened steaks so far. It is truly pre-seasoned, nothing sticks and cleanup is a breeze. You MUST preheat it, though, before beginning to cook. After I'm done, I rinse it, use a scrubby sponge to get rid of any bits of food, dry with a paper towel and spray with a non-stick coating.I have a much more expensive Emeril grill/griddle combo that sticks no matter what I do.

Cookies and turnovers get over cooked unless turned.As for the reviewers who complain about the handle getting hot. Just buy the lodge signature series with stainless handles (it only costs 5 to 10x as much) or buy a good oven mitt or two.Obviously several of the reviewers are illiterate as they didn't read the care instructions.

Reply to Email to Lodge, stated that finishing the pans would increase cost too much. I don't have a surface grinder, what it needed, so an hour with an orbital sander with mostly coarse emery paper gave me a surface I could season smooth.

I was done using non-stick pans for making rotis, what with the coating coming off and replacing them every 2 months. This product is perfect since as the other reviewers here have mentioned can be heated on high and the rotis turn out wonderful just like in India. I have yet to try dosa on it.

His musicmaking is characterized by dimension, balance, elegance and the highest level of Haydn polish. His is a lovely version never interrupted by the virtuosity of DuPre or overindulgence of Rostropovich. It is always Haydn's voice being heard through Schiff's wonderful instrument. Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin's In-The-Fields provide suitably elegant support and make this a memorable reading that wears its age well and bears repeated regular hearings without tiring the ear, heart or mind. It goes in and out of print occasionally, so buy it if it is available. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Controls are impossible","review":"I love the game it' awesome the whole gun thing and Lara Croft is sorta pretty,But the way you push a crate is hard the targeting is difficult. When she tosses a grenade you normally look up to throw higher ,but instead of going farther it falls near her causing her to take damage. Also when you look up and try to use her cable thing it's hard to attach it to your target. Other then that good game should have been longer ,but it's good for a third person shooter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lara is Back 8)","review":"I have been a TR fan since the begining.

But my husband finished this game in one day. LIke he got home from work started playing and was done by bedtime total of maybe 6 hours. I think that is not worth the money.

There was some parts that actually stumped him and that is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tomb Raider, Legend","review":"Lara Croft rocks in this beautifuly crafted and well put together game.

It's not that I can't play them, but that I don't play them constantly, so I'm not going to be the best or fastest player but simply play for the enjoyment of it. I very well remember all the original Tomb Raider games for the PS1. And I also remember how hard some of them were.Yes, this game does indeed seem shorter than the old TR games, but what is here in Legend is a delight. Gone is the learning curve of trying to manipulate Lara, taking with it the frustration, yet leaving the great sense of challenge and adventure as the beautiful locations are explored.My family and I absolutely love this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun while it lasted...but it sure didn't last.","review":"I'll just say, this is the shortest PS2 game I've ever played. It would be forgivable if the ending was big and explosive, keeping you hungry for more...but it just fell flat.The gameplay was way better than the last, for sure, and was enjoyable. But I would have rather waited longer for a fuller game, one with more levels and a final boss that takes more than 2 minutes to defeat.My advice...wait until this is a greatest hits title. Don't pay more than twenty bucks. You will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tomb Raider Legend","review":"I am a die hard TR fan. Own every game ever made. I couldn't wait for this game to come out and paid the price. I was so disappointed with this. This is not the Tomb Raider I have loved so much. I guess the familiarity from the other games is one of the things I enjoyed the most. There is no familiarity to this game except she looks like Lara Croft. What a jip this game is. It's obvious that this wasn't created by the original people, just another one of those games that bore me. I won't comment on the details as other reviewers have done that already. Anyway, my review would be too lengthy if I did. I know others were so disappointed in Angel of Darkness but in my opinion it was a heck of alot better than this mess. Lara was unique in the older games, in this one she is just another robotic clone of the rest of the stiff shut'em ups."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad","review":"Angel of darkness wasn't all that bad.It was those wierd screen-space controlsthat made in unplayable. One would think thatthis would be the first thing to fix but, no.Still the same disorientating controls, that areconstantly changing, depending on the (oftenjust as disorientating) camera.Why?!Angel of darkness, Legend, same major flaw.I gave it 2 stars because it looks nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short game","review":"When I first got this game I thought it was going to be as long and adventurous as Tomb Raider Angel of darkness. But it wasn't. The game is so easy,and it can be beaten in about a week depending on how long you play. Its a fun game but its way to short.I'm used to playing Tomb raider that are long and confusing,but you wont get it with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"best Tomb Raider in years","review":"After the appaling Angel Of Darkness, the Tomb Raider series is back and this time they appear to have got it spot on. Subtitled 'Legend', the seventh installment of Raider finds Lara back where she belongs inside dark tombs in search of ancient artifacts, and lets face it thats what Tomb Raider is all about. Crystel Dynamics have changed the control system so it's alot less frustrating than Angel Of Darkness, but the motor bike sections are utterly appaling. The graphics are absolutly stunning in parts but the game can suffer from minor slowdown. The camera can also annoy, but not enough to put you off your quest. Overall this is a flawed, but extremly enjoyable adventure and the best (if slightly short) Tomb Raider game in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to please","review":"Never go camping without it.

Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Quality, Worth the Price","review":"I purchased this Lodge 4qt Camp Dutch Oven with two things in mind. First I've wanted to try and make busciuts in a camp dutch oven ever since I watched the movie \\"Lonesome Dove\\", and saw Gus cooking busciuts in a dutch oven in a campfire. Well this last weekend I finally did it. But I did it with briquettes, 2/3 on the top and 1/3 bottom, not a campfire. It was fairly easy, and the biscuits came out wonderful. Second, I intend to try and make peach cobbler. I waiting to get some fresh peaches before attemting the cobbler. I own a larger 8qt deep dutch oven for stews, ribs, roast, etc., but the 4qt is a good size for buscuits and the cobblers. There are tons of recipies on the internet. So I say go buy a Lodge dutch oven, find some recipes you might like and start cooking outdoors. Listen to the birds chirp, feel the sun, breath the air, then eat really well. There will be some trial and error involved, but it's totally fun to learn a new way to cook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We won't camp without this now","review":"We have been thinking about getting a dutch oven for a year or so and after attending a day camp where our boys learned to cook in one, we decided it was time to purchase.

Not the least expensive, but was hoping you get what you pay for. I seasoned the cast iron oven because this is what I had read--the manufacturer seasoning is okay, but sometimes needs more help than that. Used it on a campfire and had a very successful rice and sausage dinner. Great cooking with even heat and the fireplace gloves I had purchased at the same time were a great buy. No burns and dealing with hot lids and moving embers and burning logs was no problem. Now I'm considering buying a skillet as well for camping. Would recommend to anyone that would like to learn more about dutch oven cooking, but would also recommend doing research and taking the time to take care of cast iron properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this dutch oven.","review":"Love this dutch oven .

The music speaks for itself - and these are mostly acoustic songs (apart from the excellent My Hallucination) - big production not needed. Every song has originality, insistent hooks, and a real emotional connection (or at least - well-faked sincerity). In my opinion, this is better than anything done by Styx since Paradise Theatre, or anything by Night Ranger, Damn Yankees, etc. (Though it's not a direct equation). The lyrics are heartfelt (especially in My Hallucination and the haunting Don't Talk To Me Anymore). The feel is relaxed, de-hyped, de-egoed, just music for its own sake.

In general, the recipes are very well written, all business and no fluff.My only reservation would be giving this book to the cook without cake experience. I've got 25 years' experience in cake baking, so explicit techniques that are taken for granted here needn't be elucidated. For a beginner, though, the techniques of stirring vs. beating vs. whipping vs. folding, etc., might be unfamiliar. For those cooks, I'd still recommend Marion Cunningham's Fanny Farmer Baking Book.However, for someone who already knows how to bake cakes, this could be a most valuable reference, possibly the only all-cake book they'd need. It'll also make a fine gift! The beautiful retro-graphic design of the book is an added pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of American Art Glass","review":"This is an excellent piece of work.

My question is \\"Why?\\" This mixed bag of R&B, ballads and the occasional well-known classic (Ray Davies \\"Days\\") is unsatisfying to say the least. Actually the liner notes are the best part, insightful looks at Costello's past and how his taste in music developed. The problem is I don't understand why Costello needed to make this record. Better he had put his name on a compilation of original recordings and let the listener in on what motivated him to create CD's like GET HAPPY. As it stands this CD is just a mistake. Costello's take on the various tunes lack the vitality of his original work and even the songs he should make his own, like Randy Newman's \\"I've Been Wrong Before\\" and \\"Days\\" are more annoying than memorable. If KOJAK VARIETY Vol. 2 does appear as promised, I think I'll skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Costello\`s 1995 album Kojak Variety is a collection of songs Costello wished he'd written himself.

Both songs are performed like the were his own songs.\\"Strange\\", \\"I Threw it All Away\\" and \\"Must You Throw Dirt in My Face\\" are good too.The rest of the songs are either uninteresting, uninspired or downright bad; Ray Davies\`\\"Days\\" is the worst of all.

The first time I saw or heard him play was at the Jacksonville jazz festival in the Spring of 2003 and I was floored! I was so completely mesmerized by his playing that I ran up next to the stage to get closer look and then found myself dancing to his solos. I soon stopped, when Joshua noticed me and began staring at me while he was playing and after taking a solo. He stared at me for quite some time too. The next day I went out and hunted down every Joshua Redman album I could find. This album brings back memories of that night. The energy from him comes thrugh this album so clearly. Every note he plays, packs a punch. A very powerful album indeed.

It's an outstanding program, with enough safeguards worked in to keep you from making mistakes on the ever-more complex tax forms. The only problem is the number of steps one must take to do anything, but I suspect that is necessary, since each entry has to be accurate, and the software itself must monitor your accuracy. Sometimes (as with K-1's and some other forms), the software actually falls down a bit, but if you don't know how to input the information in the first place, perhaps you are better off with someone else doing your taxes for you.In any event, for about $90 Federal and State, I got a program that created and printed the tax forms I needed.

Here's why... the manual inside has nothing but two blank, white boxes where the registration and upgrade codes should be. In other words, I've spent $24.97 for absolutely nothing, and EA's customer support has nothing helpful to offer. You can kill my character, steal my gold, even kill my character's puppy and that's fine... it's only a game. But take my money and give me essentially nothing in return? That's against the rules.If you plan on upgrading your account, do yourself a favor and buy it from your local video game retailer. That way, if your copy doesn't contain the codes you need, your refund is only a short drive away. While I do love Amazon and all the great buys it has to offer, I feel it's my civic duty to warn others about this crappy, crappy, CRAPPY piece of crappy crap.

There are no Online directions for this game. Often, when playing with the online characters, I have difficulty with learning character activities, such as how to fish, and other tasks for the game. I also have difficulty navigating around to the different cities. The small map, provided lacks readability, and cannot be seen very well, either. There are too many difficulties to explain. I am NOT enjoying this game, very much. I am STILL paying $ 12.95 per month for it, in hopes, that it MAY be improved, soon.

The only time i was helped is when they escalated the incident. EA has to make sure next time they release a game they all have the codes.

I've always been interested in fantasy & this is the perfect type of game for me. It's so much fun creating & customizing characters. It's frustrating, at first, because your character doesn't have the skills to do much & you're not strong enough to wear the cool armor or you don't have the gold to buy the cool clothes. The process of builing up skills is pretty tedious & boring but once you're there, the world opens up.I have mostly played on free shards where things are a little more customizable. I have enjoyed building my own houses, collecting pets, & embarking on many quests. You can meet people from all over the world. This game can be soo much fun & soo incredibly frustrating, at times.

During early 2007, if you were to inquire from a bookdealer or the publisher themselves, they said it was out of print and would remain that way until it was maybe released on a CD-Rom version, but never again in book form. Some people were milking what the market would bear on auction and sale sites and getting $150 or more for this book. Well, not any more! It looks as though someone had a change of heart. Record Research has gone back to the press, and now has this edition in stock and shipping from their website at the retail price of $79.95, so don't overpay for this.

Jack Webb was an amazing person creating one of the most rememberable TV shows of all time (and radio shows) but he also stared in them. This book touches on some of the biggest cases in LA police history.Along with the insight of the cases you also get a behind the scenes and history of being a police officer.

At times I found myself wondering if the author actually had made the trip, as his anecdotes were so trite (read the section on a diving expedition). His traveling companion girlfriend comes across as the more interesting of the pair, but can't save this narrative from tedium.Try something by William Dalrymple instead"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost too pretty to use.","review":"My Sister received this as a gift and said she was hesitant to use it.

He seems caught up more in the harmonics of these tunes -- which are sadly similar to one another -- than he does in the rhythm. The result is clever chord changes without a steady tempo. Most disappointing is the audio quality. It's either his left hand on the frets or his right hand doing the plucking and strumming, but there are ugly squeaks that occur much too often, and it quickly becomes distracting.

The reader, after assimilating the understanding Mokyr's model of knowledge, will reap huge rewards in their perspective of historical events and begin to look at current trends differently.This book is not intended to be light reading. The concepts require engagement; the readers engagement yields great rewards in understanding.Mokyr's \\"The Lever of Riches\\" is an excellent complement to this book.

The included cd has demos or freeware of all the software needed to make a complete game, save the c++ compiler.The fact that it uses the directX API only, is of course because this is what people today, using c++, most likely will use.In conclusion, i would've given this book 5 stars, if it wasn't for the fact that it has no complete source code examples, making it necesary to know window-management and include-requirements."},{"rating":"1","title":"De Goes continues on cheating street","review":"I bought a previous book from the author, when I was intending to buy the black art book and boy was I dissappointed.

No, Seagal is not a great actor, and yes he seemed a little out of shape for this role, but with that mischievous glimmer in his eye and his sardonic approach, he makes THE GLIMMER MAN a more than serviceable adventure. Giving Seagal a secretive background and a mystical Buddhist persona aids the picture in its quest to be different, although the plot is standard and nothing new or innovative is approached. But the fight scenes are fun and Seagal and Wayans have a perverse rapport that is enjoyable to watch. Bob Gunton and Brian Cox are fine villains as well, and a special salute to John W. Jackson as Donald, the security man with an evil smile. Fun pass the time entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not use it-coded from another Country!","review":"was not notified it may be coming from Another Country and it arrived with a code saying it could not be seen.

There were no indications that he was mad (at least not madder than the other nazi leaders) and all of a sudden he decides to fly to England to start the peace negotiations...The authors write a very stout book to investigate what happened or what could have happened. And that is my major problem with the book: on the basis of a number of very flimsy clues they draw far-reaching conclusions which they then present as the only possible truth in the rest of the book. They then use those conclusions as the basis for even more far-fetched conclusions etc.I also think that there is more to the flight of Hess than the ravings of a lunatic, but this book is a very easy way to come with a fantastic story. And the major conclusion (the person in Spandau prison was a double of the real Rudolf Hess who died in WW 2) is not supported by the evidence presented in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written WW2 whodunnit is both informative and enjoyable reading","review":"This book is a fantastic WW2 whodunnit which reveals a lot of information regarding Hess' mission for the first time. The first part of the theory, on why Hess flew to Scotland, is convincing. Perhaps linking the Duke's later plane crash with the whole episode is a bit of a stretch, but even so, it is not outlandish and presented the way it is, with plenty of convincing circumstantial evidence, quite believable.

Melody, energy, vituoso playing and brilliant songs. The Ash never bettered it and no one else has either. Fave parts are Andys solo on Sometime World (my all time favourite song). It is a circular solo which comes back to its starting point every minute or so -I wish it went a couple of minutes longer.

Probably the only interesting thing in the book is the discussion on the placement of the major third interval among the strings reducing the number of non-chord tones, which is on a single page.The only other thing that it tries to contribute is information on how various chordal shapes interrelate to each other, but if you learn all of the triads and seventh chords in all inversions on all sets of strings and how to arpeggiate them into each other (which any good guitarist must do sooner or later), you'll implicitly get this information."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"i purchased this book after reading so many good review but after i got it, i am really disappointed. it is confusing and not helping at all. my recomendation, don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Useless Guitar Book I Ever Read","review":"Author relies on unconventional scale forms as the central part of his system.

Here's your answer...","review":"I've been playing for 15 years. Thats a long time to not really know anything about my instrument. Well, the Major and natural minor scales, pentatonics, and a few positional arpeggios, but its sad how little I know about the Fretboard.Enter this book. It takes the guitar, sectiosn it off in bite-sized chunks and then reassembles the whole thing into a tastier morsel. It views things in terms of 5 movable chords. There are scales and arpeggios associated with these scales. Learn them. Then it tells shows you how they are connected.This is not a lesson book. It just gives you some patterns and suggeswted fingerings for the major scale, its modes, harmonic minor, melodic minor, chords and arpeggios. Its good if you feel like you were weak in this department and it opened up doors for me again.I'm very glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A path for people who don't have a natural grasp of the guitar","review":"This book explains why the guitar neck, which seems confusing and stupid, actually strikes an excellent balance between flexibility and usability.It shows how to systematically learn the guitar neck and how to use this knowledge.This is worthwhile for adults who will never be playing gigs but still have an interest in the instrument. I don't think there's a lot here for the truly talented.If you're a beginner and you just wanted to play chords, you don't need this book. If you're a pro, you don't need this book.

I have been playing guitar for over 40 years, in fits and starts, and just recently decided I wanted to increase my knowledge of the instrument, both in learning the construction of chords and learning to play lead lines and scales.This book is obviously useful for many people, but I found it confusing and hard to follow. All I can say is that it lacked the magic \\"switch\\" that I hoped would turn on the logic of the fretboard. No \\"Oh, yeah, I got it\\" moment for me.I wasn't looking for a \\"how to play\\" book...I basically know how to play. I'm just going to keep looking for a better book that's not over my head.

It's logical and is layed out in a way that makes sense and is easy to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasn't impressed","review":"This book does describe the logical patterns of the C-A-G-E-D sequence. Seeing how these patterns interconnect may be enlightening, but, it's not the revolutionary way of thinking the author would lead you to believe. One dissapointing thing is that the pentatonic scale is the basis for this book and when you try to adapt it to other scale forms it becomes less apparent and falls apart completely with some scale shapes. When the book eventually begins to discuss modes (which it tries hard to avoid in the first two sections) it glazes over them and doesn't convey any real information. It focuses on scale forms yet the actual underlying scale goes by a different name - confusing. You may find this book enlightening to a degree, but it won't revolutionize your playing or the way you look at the guitar. If you're looking for a good fretboard / music theory book for the guitar, this book will only get you so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"The only series of guitar lesson books you will ever need. I've have bought, read and tried to understand many books on guitar theory and have only come away with a confusing, unrelated, and academic idea of how to relate to the fretboard as a workable entity. This book takes music theory and lets you see it through the eyes of guitar and allows you to appreciate the versatility of the instrument by means of it's unique tuning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and great guitar learning method","review":"I've been playing guitar for a couple of years but I've never found anywhere else such revelations regarding the topic.

But if you want an easier, more concise, and practical guide (that I use as a performing musician and guitar instructor) that shows more concrete examples, try Fred Sokolow's Guitar Fretboard Road Maps. Edward's book is more useful for the intermediate guitarist (and beyond) who wants to deepen his understanding of the instrument (it won't improve your playing - Sokolow's will)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guitar Student \\"Must Have\\"","review":"Simply said, this is a \\"must have\\" for anyone that wants to learn what makes a guitar a guitar.

However if you'd like the DEFINITITIVE road map to how to get your fingures comfortable with the entire fretboard of a guitar, this book will show you how to get that map built in your mind quickly and in a straight forward manner.

Now I am outdoing myself in nearly every way possible, and it feels incredible. There is no feeling quite like being able to pick up a guitar and just going to town without ever running out of ideas. The CAGED method is by far the easiest way to learn you neck backwards and forwards, and you will have scales completely mastered within a few days (if you take the time to actually read the book and practice of course). I'd say that over the course of a month or so, your technique and writing skills will be significantly expanded, and you will completely have outdone yourself in every way imaginable.

When I listen to a mindfulness tape I don't want to be thinking about the reader's saliva or lack of. I cannot listen to these CDs now due to his voice. There are actually free guided meditations and body scans online that are much better.It is also a GREAT disappointment that he mentions relaxation as a goal of e.g. body scanning which is wrong, wrong, wrong. It is not a goal with mindfulness which he is very well aware of so I cannot understand why he would say in the beginning that we do the body scan to dwell in a deep state of relaxation.Huh?That is not the purpose of mindfulness/meditation/body scanning/yoga and if that is your goal then you are doomed to failure.Otherwise I love Kabat-Zinn and his work, but I am baffled by these CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Simply, all 4 are boring.

And gives you a complete perspective for the entire field. Of course, what you don't get is a complete how-to guide on any one of these topics.

The lens is perfect but there was no lens cover in the lens cover package. So they said they would ship me another one with next day shipping which was nice. But the package the lens cover was in was opened, probably during shipping and got scratched and destroyed. So they shipped me another one with next day shipping. The third had the same problem has the second one but this one had some marking like finger prints on it. I simply got a refund now and have to ship three boxes back to them. The problem is the lens package only is held together by one little plastic clip and throwing a little bubble wrap on top of it doesn't protect it from shipping when the box could probably hold 30 of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received it scratched, out of box!","review":"I received the filter and it was outside of its packaging and scratched.

It arrived loose in its packaging, had fingerprints on it, and was scrached. Very disappointed that this item was shipped to me. Maybe people handling the item don't realize what photographers expect, and the Canon packaging is just no good. I suspect the thickness of this filter would also cause vignetting on a full frame camera with any wide-angle lens. Returned for refund. On the good side, image quality through the filter seems crisp, and little vignetting on a 20D sensor, so suspect a truly new version would be fine on longer lenses.

But the movie is fatally flawed. It is just plain boring and not compelling at all. Nicole Kidman is a very good actress but the movie has a weird vibe to it that just doesn't really ring true. I felt like I was watching somebodys vision of what and how people act but the persons view just seems like bunk and unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious story-telling....","review":"Having watched 'Dogville' I was impressed by the methodology used to tell the story. It was ambitious achievement by the director but ultimately I felt the pace of the film to be ponderous and pretentious. What annoyed me most was the narration to the story which grated me. I liked the idea of the story-an almost Kafka like merger of fable and artistic license. But unfortunately relating this to film proved too difficult to achieve and what we end up with is something that fails to deliver.A valiant attempt at creating something different, worth watching for the innovative filming techniques but as a movie it just does not work for me.As for the criticisms of being anti-american, well the thought never crossed my mind because the setting could be anyway in the world. The story is a fable of human conditions and failings whatever nationality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good.","review":"Von Trier's best work was done on \\"The Kingdom\\". This film is really more of a novelty than anything else. Worth renting but I wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"I had heard nothing but wonderful things about Dogville so I was excited to rent it. Then it started. I hadn't heard *anything* about it being a movie about a play. That in itself is disappointing. I wanted a movie, not a play. Then there was the \\"Master Of The Obvious\\" narration. I thought it too distracting, and annoying because I was trying to concentrate on the characters and the story. Especially the excellent interactions between Grace and Tom. The narration kept butting in telling you what you obviously could tell what was going on. I also did not enjoy the camera work. The shakiness was a little dizzying. Because of all these factors, I couldn't last more than half an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"From the Founder of the All-Movie Guide","review":"I will go out on a limb here and just call it a \\"dog.\\" I was surprised it was in the form of a play with a theater-style set. I got over that. There was some good acting, but it was mostly \\"play\\" acting. I even grew tired of that as the film crawled along for three hours and got a little grumpy as it slowly loped downhill. I was hoping for some more positive resolution. I did have a good laugh at the ending. Serves them right. In short: I had enough \\"lectures\\" from all the art films I suffered through in the 1960s, when I was naive. I have no excuse now. I must apologize for my opinion to those who found substance in this film, but I consider it a real waste of my time. This is not how I want to be entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not be misled - it is not about America","review":"I liked the movie, it is very powerfull, very insightfull, very very good. But - man! - it is not about America.I am an expat who lived in America for a long time, and it took me to come to Denmark and to stay here for over a year to realize that the movies is about Denmark.The whole movie is all about a country ruled by a so called Jante Law (an old set of rules in Denmark that starts with Dare Not Think That You Are Better Than Us). The Danes know this rule very well, and I guess they are the ones to realize this immediatelly that the movie is about their country.Sometimes it happens to an artist that he thinks that he writes about one thing (in this case - America), and the result is about something different, about something that he knows much better (in this case - Denmark)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Look at Ugly Human Nature.","review":"Nicole Kidman is at her best as Grace, a woman hiding from the mob during the depression, who hides out in a mountain township. After deals are made and friendships blossom, power corrupts and human(?) nature takes over, and things get very ugly. Even the end credits deal with man's inhumanity to his fellows. Some of the best set designs I've never seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"VonTrier hasn't disappointed yet!","review":"LVT has produced some of the most gut-wrenching and thought-provoking works of the last decade. \\"Dogville\\" does not disappoint. I have a theory that will probably offend, but here goes. Anyone who has a problem with the length of his stories,either finding it boring or slow is someone who is unaware that it takes time to form an impact. If they had shown the climax to \\"Dogville\\" after 1 hour of character development and story, its impact would be nil.I have to say that I was overwhelmingly satisfied with the denounment, and draw political allusions if you must, as they are there to be taken, but I was swept away by the literal aspect of the story. I found it highly entertaining, and expertly crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open mind to something DIFFERENT","review":"The 3-hours go by fast, the movie will make you feel sad, happy with joy (15 rings of the bell), ANGRY (rape), sad then Relief. The movie is not anti-American it could have been a story from Russia or Mexico, it just deals with man kind at it's best then show us it's worst, the story is told in a simple format, there is no blood or black bruises, the film lets the viewer's mind fill in the blanks of the scenes. I could go on, but if you would like more info, all you have to do is read a few of the other reviews, overall a very interesting film, it will keep you thinking long after the DVD has stopped."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great movie for psuedo intellectuals with time to waste...","review":"I am not 100% certain where all the fascination with the most base and rank parts of human nature came from, but this movie spends three hours making certain that you get your fill. After chapter three, I was able to predict the entire movie with Nostradamus-like clairvoyance. The movie follows quite a simple pattern. In any given situation, select the most base and evil part of human nature, amplify it by a factor of 100, and then make it reality... Over and over again... And hey, while your at it why don't you sexually abuse the Grace character again.The only redeeming quality of this film was the way it was produced. I did appreciate the unusual stark soundstage and how it very much reflected a play setting. This setting was used to its best effect the first time that Grace was raped.Overall, however, the movie was long, uninteresting and poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of nonsense on non sets","review":"I give the director credit for trying something new. On the other hand, he could not have told the absurd story in a realistic setting. Without the artificiality of the non sets, no one would believe or accept what he had to say. The casting and acting were quite good, however. I am tempted to give the movie another star for that reason but I am too repulsed by the bleak vision of humanity presented here. The moral of the story can only be that if given power over another person, anyone will ferociously use and abuse that person. In this crowd, even the upright philosopher of the group was easily corrupted, while the Kidman character, who was portrayed as a kind of saint full of forgiveness, joined them in their depravity when she got the power. Sorry, this terrible tale has no relationship to the world I live in. I do wish critics would stop automatically anointing all stories of human degradation as art. After watching this one, I felt like I needed a long shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"One bark movie","review":"(...) Endlessly and relentlessly grim, nonsensical and boring.

Pretentious in an artsy fartsy way--boring and in my opinion very amatuerish--most high school stage productions have superior props. (oh yeah-I guess that was intentional-there should have been a warning on this dvd-all scenes are filmed like a rehearsal)Can't say much about the story line-since I (and those I was watching this with) decided we just couldn't take any more of it-but if this was supposed to be interesting-I think I'd rather watch a spider spin a web!\\"Stepford Wives\\", \\"Dogville\\" and \\"Birth\\"--is Nicole on a losing streak or what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexplicable nonsense - Are Minus Stars Possible?","review":"Lewis Carroll would have given up writing had he been forced to endure this version of Through the Looking Glass.

However, the opposition should not be silenced, and if this is the way Von Trier imagines the social interactions so be it. On the artistic level this film works fairly well. Barely present scenery in function of revealing dark secrets of life in a small town (Twin Peaks, anyone?). Deux at machina resolution as the well worked out ending to the, essentially, tragic play. Overall atmosphere of bleaknees contributes well to the artistic intent.To sum up, I don't think it's fair to disregard this movie on the ideological ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lars Von Trier is amazing!!","review":"Nicole Kidman was excellent in this film. I picked up a used copy at Suncoast and I didn't really know what to expect. What a pleasant surprise. The diabolical residents of Dogville are all too believable. The torment Grace endured made my heart want to burst through my chest. I felt for her. The final chapter of the film had me glued to the screen. Can't spoil it but I must say that the end was very satisfying. Cinematography was just gorgeous. Lars has a unique style in which the camera will cut several times to different angles in the same scene. You can find the same camera work in his other films such as Breaking the Waves and Dancer in the Dark. Fantastic film. A bit disappointed that others didn't enjoy it as much as I did.

There are no special effects to liven things up. There really isn't any set to speak of. This is a film that is firmly centered on the script, the ideas, and the actors' abilities to convey the words and thoughts. The rest is up to the viewer.Dogville has my mind spinning. It forces you to confront some seemingly simple ideas. The one concept that has me all conflicted is: arrogance vs. forgiveness. Everyone will walk away with a variety of issues to discuss with others. And, I would imagine that some of these conversation will be rather heated.Dogville isn't entertaining. This isn't a movie to watch if you just want to flake out. There are many powerful scenes and a tremendous amount of dialogue that will keep you engaged. Just make sure you're in the mood for almost three hours of thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Boring. I have to admit I wanted to like this film. I normally love experiments.

Yes, I get the sort of Our-Town set design. Yes, I get the conflict between self righteousness and forgiveness. Yes; I get the continuous sense of detachment. And, yes, I get that being too forgiving is not a favor. But after watching this I was left wondering why I had sacrificed three hours of my life to watch it.

Seeing this performance live might have worked for me as it's much easier to relate or engage with live on-stage actors. However, put them on film without any adjustments to acting or style, including little editing, and it gets boring fast.In contrast, a related movie with this style, the Hitchcock movie \\"Rope\\", was successful by using very good camera work and lighting, more props, and extremely pronounced acting - almost over-emphasizing words and actions - that all transfered well to film. (Oh, the suspense helped engage the viewer too here.)Dogville was an experiment in film making, it's minimalistic approach won't appeal to many, and they didn't get the stage acting to work well on film. The film is lost between stage acting style and film media style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"Dogville is such a long, boring, pretentious movie I have ever seen! I was expecting something great even spectacular but Dogville is highly over-rated and horrible. I like Nicole Kidman, wonderful, gifted actress but why did she do this movie?

I can only hope that the acids from my own vomit will melt down the plastic so that it's made unwatchable, because it's unwatchable regardless.

My wife and I moved from Los Angeles (pop. 7 million) to a town in northwest Arizona (pop. 250). We loved the country but suffered a malignant hostility, all too late, that clothed itself in righteousness. We created a fire department, we provided medical services, all volunteer. It was taken and used by this town with no thanks, but exploited. We could not understand the actions of the townsfolk or the lens through which they perceived reality.

The concept and story are awesome. The acting and script are decent at best - I think von Trier did everything in one take and didn't care how wooden or emotionless the acting was as long as he had the shot. The use of the narrator is such a lazy thing to do - a director should show the audience what the characters are thinking and feeling, not tell them. I don't have a qualm with narrations if used only a few brief times in a film. Dogville uses narration very frequently and for no real reason other than Lars von Trier didn't feel like showing (or couldn't figure out how to show) the audience what is happening. The editing is dreadful. There are random jump cuts that exist for no reason (unlike, say, Traffic or Memento where the jump cuts make sense or at least look awesome). The film annoyed me more than it entertained me or made me think. I rate the film a 2/5, mostly for the concept and story.

This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. For the first time I saw James Caan deliver a lousy performance. Even he seemed bored and embarrassed to find himself playing this role.

There you have it.I would describe Trier as a \\"Brilliant\\" sadist. Nothing more. Everyone knows he takes his actors and litteraly tortures them.

She'd be a ruined woman upon arriving in Canada, and her father would punish her accordingly, I'd imagine. Also, when she first speaks with Drake she'd been hiding under his bed for a night - so she's already ruined at this point. Why does this not cross her mind?

This is because the pharmacology questions on the test are in the context of a clinical scenario, which most FMGs will be familiar with.If one is to pick and choose, my recommendation is to study the first few chapters on Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics, CNS, CVS, Respiratory, Renal.

Thoughtfully written, horrifying yet hopeful, this story straight forwardly captures the cruelty of the killer while demonstrating the determination of the police to capture this pervert before he kills more children. The heroine Angela is a normal person who is just beginning her police career.

Plus, the exercises have really helped me. I just play the flute for fun, but I really love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for the musical novice","review":"This is a good book for someone with little or no prior musical experience, but for an experienced musician trying to learn a new instrument, it is a bit weak. Approximately 90% of the text is about really basic music theory (ie, how to count 4/4 time, how a whole note is notated, etc), and very little is devoted to technique particular to the instrument. Don't get me wrong, there is a fair bit of flute technique, but I find it frustrating to have to wade through pages and pages of rudimentary material to find it. The amount of material that is helpful to the beginning flautist can probably be compressed to 10 pages.Disclaimer: I have only had a flute for 48 hours, and have read through the book only once.

The book is clear, and does not set up unrealistic expectations of how the learning process will go. Although I already know how to read music, the book does explain very well how to get started with reading as well as the acctual playing of the instrument. I would certainly recomend this book to a beginer, but if you already play, skip to something a little more advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will damage your body","review":"If you ignore all the book says about posture, actually this book is very good. It has good explanations of each concept. Much in the style of Kujulas book 'the flutists progress'. The only difference is that the posture the author advises the student do will damage the back, cause RSI in the pinky finger. as well as put the rest of the body under undue tension.If you as a student don't want to ever practise more than 15 minutes a day, then it won't matter. However, students who use this posture, but go on to levels where they need to practise for 3 hours a day, will find themselves very damaged. This is a very common problem among conservatorium students. The rest of the book is useful for the beginner to feel in control of his learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to Play Again","review":"I had put down the flute for 19 years. This book is awesome for re-learning what I'd forgotten. It teaches slowly enough so it doesn't intimidate, but not too slowly that I get bored.

So, we keep it outside in the garage but it still goes off sometimes. The other one is not going off for no reason, but if it gets bumped out of the outlet- the shrill is relentless and it is not easy to reset. The directions are on the back of this thing, but you have to sit through the shrilling beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeppp while you read the instructions. It's enough to drive a person CRAZY. Babies are screaming, pets are running. It's unnecessarily loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a joke...","review":"This thing is so bad it's almost funny. Except I wasn't laughing when it woke the household up with a false alarm at 6 AM on a Sunday morning. This wasn't the low-battery chirp -- it was the full-on alarm. After finally getting it to stop shrieking (no easy feat, as you have to unscrew the battery compartment and yank the battery out to get it to shut up), I decided to hold off on calling 911. No gas appliances had been running, the windows were open, and no one in the family was suffering from symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. I ran out to a local store to buy another brand of alarm with a digital display. It has been plugged in for several hours now, and as I suspected, it's not registering any carbon monoxide.This was just the final straw in a long string of irritating incidents. It always had a knack for picking the most inopportune times to notify us of the low battery, and we could never remove it from the outlet without being subjected to its ear-splitting screech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too tamper resistant for safety's sake","review":"Shame on Kidde for not recalling this \\"tamper resist alarm.\\" It is downright scary that the packaging on this product advertises it as \\"ideal for children's rooms or rental property.\\" Nobody would want this device in their home, particularly with small children or other tenants nearby. There is a risk that it will malfunction and damage your hearing and possibly that of others as well. Here are the facts: (1) When the device malfunctions, it emits a continuous eardrum-splitting alarm for no reason. (2) If that happens to you, you will find that the reset button does not work, and you cannot immediately silence the alarm as the packaging represents. (3) Instead, the device is designed to be so tamper-resistant that you can't silence the alarm until you remove the battery, and you can't do that until you find the right screwdriver to open the battery compartment. I shudder to think what would happen to someone who is unable to find the right screwdriver in time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, rated <1 star.","review":"Bought at Home Depot 3 weeks ago.

I did everything exactly as detailed in the instructions. I thought the battery must be low, but after replacing with a brand new battery, I had the exact same issue. I even tried reversing the battery to ensure that it was installed properly. Nothing worked.I'm still trying to get in touch with customer service. I was on hold for 20 minutes on the phone before giving up and now cannot get their email form to work either.This is an unsafe alarm because it gives false alarms. Who would believe it was giving a real alarm after it had given so many false alarms? After having the HVAC service come and check everything in the house, I know that I have no CO emissions, but the alarm continues to go off."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS product-Contact Consumer Product Safety Commission","review":"This product is DANGEROUS- it is unreliable and gives false alarms when CO is not present. Additionally, the alarm, which is supposed to be 85 decibels, is painfully loud and cannot be turned off with the reset-test button as specified in the directions. My new unit screamed for nearly an hour outdoors even after I approached it with ear protection to try to silence it with the reset button.DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT AND IF YOU HAVE, I RECOMMEND CONTACTING THE CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY COMMISSION.

Should to stomp on it until it decides to shut up? Maybe you were born without ears and this it not an issue for you- but it is for me and makes me certain that I will never, EVER, buy any Kiddie products in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't run on AC power","review":"I bought this a few weeks ago, and still can't get it to operate on AC power, no matter which outlet I plug it into. The plug itself is poor quality (made in China, no surprise there) and does not plug solidly into any wall outlet. The once-every-20-second green light flashing tells me that the battery backup is still working, but since it won't run on regular power, it's going to die as soon as the battery runs out of juice. Big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of garbage","review":"You wouldn't think that a \\"respected\\" name like Kidde would put out a piece of garbage like this.

I changed the battery and it would not stop screeching. I removed and replaced the battery assuming it was not making a good connection and it seemed to be OK. After two days it started chirping again. I had already moved another detector next to it so I knew we weren't getting too much CO2 so its going back to HD tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rare malfunction causes false alarm","review":"Well, I didn't write this to bash the product. However, I wanted to make sure that others are familiar with this malfunction. While my family was preparing for dinner, the alarm made one continuous high pitched,piercing sound (not separate beeps). I couldn't shut it off, and now my ears hurt a little bit. After getting fresh air and resetting the battery, it seemed to OK. However, the family was already disturbed, and because the manual doesn't mention anything about a continuous beep(siren), we knew that we couldn't trust the alarm and called the fire dept. directly. They did a reading and thank God it was 0 everywhere, even by both of the furnaces and water heater. I'm going to return it for a new one and use it as a spare. For the primary alarm, I plan to purchase another brand with a readout screen. I am so glad that this happened at 6:00pm and not 2:00 am! By the way, we've only had the alarm less than 6 months. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unnecessarily loud when there is no carbon monoxide","review":"It is a good idea to have a very loud alarm when there is carbon monoxide detected. Better to have sore ears that to stay asleep.But do we need a painfully loud alarm because the battery is getting low? Or because someone unplugged it from the wall? Do we need the loud beeping to continue while you're looking for a screwdriver to open the battery compartment? The alarm is so loud it puts you in a panic to do anything to SHUT IT OFF as soon as possible.No. I have these in my house and the false alarm tonight is the last straw.DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL unless it's a gift for someone you secretly dislike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unit died after 5 months","review":"After owning for only 5 months, the alarm started buzzing constantly. The only way to stop it was to remove the batteries. According to the owners manual this means the device has malfunctioned and must be sent to Kidde for replacement. Hopefully they will exchange the unit without the original proof of purchase. It is very disappointing when a device with a 5 year warranty dies after 5 months especially when it is meant to save your life. I would recommend buying a more reliable device."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really dislike the tamper alarm","review":"It was slightly ajar in the wall, still powered on though. Pushed it in further. Started chirping. Took it out to see what was going on and try to stop it (because it was in the room with someone who is sensitive to loud noise). Then this insane \\"tamper\\" constant alarm starts shrieking (and it sounded WAAAAY louder than 85 dB) until we finally plugged it back in and reset it.I hate to think what would happen if there's a power outage. A backup battery is meant to keep it working when off AC, not to make it sound like being off AC is worse than CO gas itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money!","review":"Purchased this alarm for a rental unit in Pennsylvania, despite reading several \\"not so favorable\\" reviews. Don't waste your money! This alarm started beeping after only 6 months in service. Tried to contact the supplier, but to no avail. Next stop, right to Kidde. I've used other carbon monoxide products by them, which lasted 4-5 years. Must be a manufacturing defect on this particular model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or mony....","review":"I purchased 3 of these units and took all three back because the battery doesn't fit properly.

Turned off burner. Ate breakfast. Did dishes, then poured water out of pan. Egg white residue stuck on bottom just like Revere stainless/copper bottom I was trying to replace, though residue not as heavy. Rinsed with detergent, did not try to remove residue as it resisted finger effort to move. Later, after pan dried, the residue came off with light finger rubbing.Warning!

After I washed it with a sponge (nothing to scratch it) like normal I saw that the nonstick coating was already flaking off in several places. I'm surprised there were so many positive reviews. This is a terrible product do not waste your money! I would give no stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay pan, but the lid could fit a little better","review":"The glass lid could be just a little bit bigger - say about a couple of millimeters. It fits inside the pan's rim, but it kind of rattles around in there. There isn't a gasket or seal between the glass and the metal rim, so condensation can leak on a counter or stove when the lid is inverted. Kind of a nuisance.Aside from the lid, one gets the impression that it's a pan with acceptable quality.To give you an idea of the capacity, the pan will hold two 15 oz. cans of vegetables.SEVEN MONTHS LATER: a little of the nonstick coating has come loose, and I'm tired of the lid. This is not a quality pan. I just ordered this:Calphalon Contemporary Nonstick 1-1/2-Quart Saucepan with Glass Lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor finish","review":"I have used this pot probably a dozen times so far and the biggest issue I have is the oxidized finish. The finish is blotchy, showing wet spots, fingermarks and leaves a chaulky resedue on your hands when you touch it. That was before I washed it after it was soaking in the sink for a few hours. A simple wipe with a sponge and all of the dark oxidized finsih came right off. Now it is a dull light silver. The chaulkyness is much less now but it looks like a cheap hand-me-down.

I like it. It looks good. I wouldn't call it lightweight ... it has enough heft to it. I haven't noticed the handle getting hot or even warm. I suspect that some folks are using a flame or burner which is wider than the pot bottom. Certainly if you apply heat directly to the handle it will get hot but I haven't felt the pot transferring heat through the handle at all. I had a one quart which was a little too small and a two quart which was a bit too big. So like Goldilocks I was looking for something in the middle but one and a half quart pots are hard to find. This pot at this price at this quality was just right. An added bonus is that this pot heats quickly.

He does have a nice turn of phrase, and that's what brought me back for another try.Unfortunately, style is clearly his primary focus, leaving the balance of his writing in the two books in this series to shallow story line and characterization. As a result, while the reader may be entertained by the author's style, there's no depth of story or characters to hold his curiosity.At least this time around Sallis didn't serve up another gooey helping of his syrupy-sweet (and Walt Disney phony) view of the Deep South, as he did in \\"Cypress Grove\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book with suspense","review":"A good mystery keeps you turning the pages and trying to figure out whom is chasing her.Would recommand to my friends"},{"rating":"1","title":"My kingdom for an editor!","review":"I bought this on Kindle, so I expect errors in punctuation and such, but this one suffered from far more than just punctuation issues.

A book that you can put down...and then pick up. Perhaps taking a week to complete. This book was impossible for me. The author takes the main character throught at least four different phases of his life, (big city cop, small town deputy, psychologist, inmate). The problem is that you never are certain which phase the character is in.......or how it relates to the main plot, if there is one.

Sallis gives the reader so little at times that i find myself having to read the page twice, and even then i do not get much from it. Turner is a somewhat interesting character but there's not enough meat there for me. Sallis' Lew Griffin stories which take place in New Orleans in the 60s are far better. Lew is an ex-collector for loan sharks who becomes a French Lit prof at Tulane and a practicing alcoholic. He's the thinking man to James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux.

What it really seems to be is a carelessly written, poorly researched history; I guess the logic is then to call it fiction (a novel) so it cannot be criticized as a carelessly written, poorly researched history. I believe that the book contains poor typography, poor grammar, and 'historical errors', but since it is called fiction, I guess the author is off the hook for historical or factual errors.If you are interested in Old West history or biographies of Old West characters like Doc Holliday, do not waste money on this trash - get a book published by a university press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doc Holliday's Road to Tombstone","review":"Although I am a former graduate student in history, the history of Wild West isn't my specialty.

I highly recommend it.Update: after 2.5 years or reasonably heavy use (2-3 times a week) the non-stick coating came off and everything started sticking. I never put the skillet on high heat or let it heat up empty. I always hand-washed it with a soft sponge but I guess 2.5 years is all you can expect from a skillet. Not bad for the money, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this brand!!","review":"After using this skillet for a few months (gas stove), this thing began sticking in a small spot in the middle that began expanding, week after week. Now we have to place items to cook only around the edges, so I'm ordering Circulon pans after reading stellar reviews. Why do companies sell crap that doesn't perform as advertised, when it will alienate future & repeat customers? WE don't forget the bad products OR who made them, we'll not buy anything by Cuisinart again - despite the possibility that they MAY make some good products. Fooled once, shame on Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Pan","review":"You cannot beat Cuisinart's products for price and quality. This is a gorgeous pan.

You can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected cheap but","review":"I have long since stopped buying expensive non-stick cookware because the Teflon coating simply will not stand the test of time. So when I choose to buy non-stick I go for the cheaper manufactures and expect them to last only a few years. That is why I choose this product. The overall construction met my expectations. It's not heavy and the handle is firmly attached and should work well on a gas range.My problem with this product is the manufacturer applied a sticker smack dab in the bottom middle of the pan. Now we know all types of stickers over time become like glue when you try and remove them (even from a Teflon coated surface). Saddly I could not remove this sticker without scratching the Teflon coating and I was forced to return it.I would not buy again from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Not even close to flat on a glass cooktop.Very thin metal.It's a return or garbage item for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very thin.

It is awful - DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!To address issues other have had -(1) It was perfectly flat out of the box, but warped as soon as medium heat was applied. Probably because it is so thin. Note the 10\\" crepe pan weighs as much as this monster of a pan, and appears to be at least 3 times thicker.(2) It is way too thin to heat evenly - I think our heavy duty cookie sheets are just as thick! To check it out, I used an infrared thermometer and found out that once the hottest part of the pan reached about 350 (ideal for things like eggs and pancakes), there were parts that were 75 degrees cooler. This means burnt eggs and raw pancakes. Yum.The size would probably make a good chicken fryer for a large family, but it has no top, so I'm not sure what you really could do with it, so mine went back today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"Like the rest of my cuisinart hard-anodized cookware this skillet is a pleasure to use.

I am a good chef and know how to properly use a pan. Within a few uses this pan was scratched. I did not overheat the pan, nor did I use mental tongs to turn the meat. So, I am very disppointed with this pan. Also, for the record, I did not use excessive cleaners that would compromise the integrity of the pan. I do not recommend this pan at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan is not flat!!","review":"This pan sits so uneven on the stovetop that only less than half of the bottom contacts the stovetop and so food cooks terribly unevenly. If you have a ceramic or other electric non flame surface, the uneven cooking is worse cause there's no flame to bridge the break in contact. Andof course, oil pools on less than half the pan which makes it even more fun to use. I bought it as a gift and by the time I gave it and it was used, the refund time expired. My biggest issue with sellers in any situation is their lack of quality control - did they even for a second place the pan on a flat surface to see if it sits flat???? clearly not. And for a big name like Quisinart? They should be ashamed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT Skillett","review":"I recently purchased this 8\\" pan, and am extremely impressed with the quality and performance.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one to get","review":"Tried different ones from Cuisinart, Anolon - they were good but they would burn out after a year or so. I assumed that was normal. The quality of this particular model seems way above what I've seen / used so far, and there is no doubt in my mind this will last longer.. Only minor negative - no lid included, so I am using a lid from an older Cuisinart model - works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Uneven Pan....don't waste your money","review":"I'm giving this pan one star for it's size. I wanted a very large pan...and it is. However it does not sit flat on my stove top. I have a ceramic top stove...this makes for uneven cooking. The oil pools to one side of the pan. Don't waste your money!!!! Another reviewer mentioned this, but I was hoping their pan was a defect. Obviously the pan is just made uneven. Again, don't waste your money....my suggestion: look for the WearEver nonstick 12 inch skillet which was select best skillet by Cook's Illustrated.

All of a sudden I hear a loud \\"Pop\\" from the pan. I knew immediately what the sound was. Several years ago, one of Cuisinart pan bolt covers blew off while I was cooking and just missed hitting me in the head. I thought that was a fluke and so have continued using your products. Now I realize it wasn't a fluke, there is a serious design and/or manufacturing issue with your pan bolts.I called the Cuisinart service desk and was invited to get my pan inspected by your team and consider for replacement (your tag #301-289-444) - but I have to pay postage both ways! That's about $20 postage and packaging to get considering for replacement of a $25 pan that has a dangerous flaw.I wish Cuisinart would stand behind its products, and I hope they can fix this dangerous flaw with their skillets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other reviews are right","review":"This is the best non-stick pan I've ever owned. After reading some of the reviews I decided I'd buy one and sacrifice it to the cooking Gods. I've abused it horribly. I use metal implements, sear the heck out of stuff, stick it in the dishwasher. I've used everything but steel wool on it. It's not damaged, it looks like new. I have no idea how the surface is different from every other Teflon pan I've owned - but it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"great skillet at great price","review":"I have been looking for a good skillet to saute vegetables and I find this really working well. You might want to use it with medium to low flame. High flame might sometimes burn the food depending on what is being cooked. Hard anodized surface is very easy to clean and non sticky too. I recommend this skillet for any starters as well as experienced cooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifetime warranty! (You'll need it)","review":"I'm on probably my 3rd or 4th unit. I continually send them in for replacement, because the coating wears off despite meticulous care.Cuisinart will tell you - do not heat higher than medium, do not use metal utensils, and do not place in the dishwasher. How you cook without going over medium is beyond me, but just be aware.I keep getting a replacement because, well, I can, but my next purchase won't be a Cuisinart. My Calphalon stuff seems to hold up a lot better. Actually, my cheap cast iron holds up better too....:^)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding product","review":"As a rule, I'm not a fan of nonstick pans, but for some more delicate foods (i.e. eggs, crepes, etc) they are an enormous help. All of the nonstick pans I've owned previously were thin and light, therefor having hot spots, poor heat conduction, and cooling down very quickly when cold or room temp food hit the surface. This pan eliminates those issues.The robust construction of the pan provides excellent heat conduction and perfect distribution, even on an electric range. The nonstick surface is excellent, and not as easily scratched as most nonsticks that I've encountered (making storage less of a worry). The stay-cool handle actually DOES stay cool. The pan cleans up easily, and lives up to everything the description promises.I will be buying more products from Cuisinart, as this one set the bar quite high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it Constantly!!","review":"Good quality pan.

I was not able to cook an over-medium egg on it without using oil. I was not able to cook a pancake on it. The pan I received was not a non-stick pan. It was more like \\"stick resistant\\".For the same money, I purchased the Calphalon 10 and 12 inch pan combo set. The construction was similar although the non stick coating was different. I was able to cook an egg and a pancake on the Calphalons with no issues. So, 2 pans instead of 1 for the same money, and they have a better coating? No brainer.The quality was mediocre. I was replacing a 9 year old Calphalon which had 3 rivets on handle, this had 2. It was thin and too light.

The production amazes me too. They truly are very talented people who deserve to be heard in this project, I would love to hear new material.

Due to the highly ductal quality of titanium, there's less rebound--transferring more power to the nail--so the hammer drives like a 22 to 24 oz framer. If it's still too light for you, wait for the 16 oz titanium. It's less like a California framer and more a classic Vaughn style and drives like a 28 oz."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor imitation","review":"The hammer that I purchased is a casting, and not a forged hammer head that I thought I was going to receive.

I feel disappointed with this filter for 2 reasons: (1) it came with light scratches (obviously used), (2) it produces internal reflections (it is not multicoated) -- when pointed at the light, a strong flare develops. (From what I read about coatings, multicoated filters produce a green reflection of a light source, filters with few coatings produce a faint reflection and uncoated filters have a bright reflection -- this filter shows a pretty distinct reflection that is not green). I returned this filter and got a Hoya 72mm UV HMC filter. Much better. Occasional flare can be seen (I guess this is the price of protecting your lens), but it is *significantly* better than the Canon filter. My recommendation is to get the Hoya filter for a little more - it is worth it. (One drawback of the Hoya was it was much more difficult to screw onto the lens.) Happy picture taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"If you want a NICE UV/Haze filter, you'll need to spend some money.

The camera is great, but the filter was not, so I returned it. A local camera shop pro showed me how inferior it was to the equivalent filter by Hoya, which reflects almost no light, while the Canon reflects a great deal. The Hoya filter costs more than the Canon, but it certainly seems stupid to try to save $30 when you've invested $1000+ on a camera, especially when the filter directly affects the quality of the pictures -- which, after all, is what it's all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Education doesn't change","review":"This is a really interesting book.

EVERY other song on this album is awesome, a hip hop masterpeice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's Missing Here","review":"Rush Hour is a great movie! The Soundtrack however is something I could do without! The biggest song in the movie is Edwin Starr's \\"War.\\" Not only is it played countless times, but it is even referred to by Chris Tucker in the dancing scene. But for some reason it did not make it to the soundtrack! This is unfortunate because had it been on the soundtrack...it would've easily been the best song on this CD!

Often times, they just cut off in the middle of a song. Other times, it's an abrupt fadeout that pays no attention to the form of the song.I read the other review about this before buying it. I ignored the review and bought it anyway. I wish I had listened and bought something else. This one is a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I listened to this album several times now and it's not really what I expected. Wimbish is a good bassplayer but this experimental stuff is not really great.

More than focusing on the story line I found myself \\"catching\\" all the mistakes in his grammer. The idea and the story seemed interesting but I just couldn't keep track. When I did finally finish the book I was more mad that I paid money for it. This is one to borrow but not pay for. If you'd like to practice your english skills, this ones for you.

The translation by Sally Wilson gives anyone interested in the Middle Ages access to this important text. Margaret Jennings, who did the Latin edition of the Ars, has written an introduction which discusses the entire genre of preaching manuals, and her notes explain difficulties in Higden's text. The book also includes a bibliography and index, plus a description of the Latin manuscripts of Higden's original text.Highly recommended for students of literature and rhetoric and of the Middle Ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultralife Tape","review":"I purchased an ultra life tape about 1 month ago and within a couple of weeks the tape stopped retracting all the way.I proceeded to pull the tape to its 25 ft length and clean it.It helped for about 2 days.The last 10 inches of the tape pust be pushed back in the case.I am not impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this","review":"I have seen just about every war movie known to man and I honestly have to say this is one of the best.

Obviously none of the reviewers served as a Special forces LRRP because this movie is full of technical flaws and inaccuracies. LRRPS never wore steel pot helmets, always wore black or camo face paint, moved silently and for f-sakes didn't use a field radio to listen to music on missions! These are just a few of the many almost laughable errors in this movie.

After reading all reviews and deciding to fork over $12.00 for a used VHS copy.......I somewhat expected a \\"classic\\" on line with Platoon or DeerHunter. I will agree that this movie had a low budget....and it does show. The \\"battle scenes\\" amounted to little more than something a bunch of kids could do in the woods behind their homes. I can't believe that Leonard Maltin gave this movie 3 stars in his movie review book. The movie failed to convince me that this was taking place in 1969....Jungles of Vietnam. Nothing realistic about this failed \\"war\\" movie. This movie is only worth a price of .99 to 1.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite war movie","review":"I love war movies big and small but this is small one is my favorite. I just love all the great characters in this movie. I saw it in the theaters in it's original run and have it on VHS. The movie is presented documentary style so there is no mood music which is so present in war movies and the hand held jittery camera makes the movie feel unedited, more like raw footage or a newsreel. The actors, mostly unknown, do a great job as an ensemble cast. It's a movie about soldiering. Many war movies ignore why and how soldiers become soldiers but this movie shows how and why these individuals became soldiers and how they fit into a squad. Young men, juvenile and ignorant, but also brave, courageous, and committed to their soldier buddies. In the end the soldier fights not for his country but to protect his buddy. In the battlefield all they have is each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film---Needs to be more widely seen!","review":"An excellent; much over-looked film.

Whilst Platoon & Casualties of war are very nice 'emotional' pieces I find them contentious & treehugging. 84C is plain & unhindered by right & wrong moral implications of the war & attempts to show the life of the troops with no backstory or drama than that of survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overwhelmingly Beautiful","review":"I find the Brahms trios some of the greatest romantic chamber pieces ever written. This version is beyond compare. I have all the major versions of the first 2 trios and this one is the greatest. It is a little slower, more moving and more beautifully played than all the others. Starker, Suk and Katchen are amazing. I treasure this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst tab book I've ever purchased","review":"I bought this used on a whim at my local book store based on the song list and soon realized why it was traded in to begin with. This book is riddled with missing riffs (sometimes entire sections of songs), suffers from \\"over tabbing\\" (trying to expand chords that the artists and musicians themselves don't use when recording or playing the songs live) and other errors.Save your money and just stick with google and youtube for learning how to play these songs.

However, I happily devoured a Hershey bar afterwards...just to keep the connection a little longer. Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book because I am a fan of Frances Ray.

When I found this I was happy. I immediately loved it. My favorite track is Here I Go Again. This, to me is the REAL version of the song, with the original lyric; \\"Like a HOBO, I was born to walk alone.\\" (It was changed to DRIFTER, in 1987.) I LOVE the more bluesy sound of the song. Far superior to the 1987 remake. The same goes for this version of Crying In The Rain. I also love the title track, Bloody Luxury, and Victim Of Love, all of which truly rock! Definitely a classic! I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to hear a truly cohesive band. The guitars of Micky Moody (one of Britains most underrated slide guitarists!) and Mel Galley are great! The rhythm section of Neil Murray on bass, Deep Purple's Ian Paice (drums) and Jon Lord (keyboards) really hold it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A super Whitesnake album","review":"saint n simmers is one of the best albums from the early albums of Whitesnake one of the finest rock groups from the Uk.This album showcases some the finest songs starting from the beginning.This album is good and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome Spirit, Great Voice!","review":"This is Becka Shae's first album and if you haven't treated yourself to her smooth vocals and clean Christian lyrics, download this album and help yourself... you will be glad you did.

And I really thought that most of the innocent suspects had much more motive to commit the murder than the person who actually did it. The ending was very weak...I felt let down by the criminal. And the Norfolk coast seems like a sordid little world that I wouldn't want to visit, let alone live there. I didn't care for most of the characters and I found that I didn't really care who the murderer was by the time the book finally ended. A waste of time...I got rid of the book after I read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikable Characters","review":"It seems as if every woman in the book is insecure, unstable and doesn't like other women. The character I would like to see eliminated was a hostile teenaged girl who worshipped her alcoholic father, fawned over her infant brother, and treated her 4 year old twin sisters like whipping girls. P.D. James seems to forget about the (abused) little girls later in the book as if they didn't matter.I used to like P.D. James. Now, I will never read another book of hers again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"PD James took her time to develop the characters, the atmosphere and the plot. Let's face it, usually one of those 3 elements is missing in a mystery novel, but not this one. The characters are so real that I care about some of them - and could be moved to kill one or two of them myself. No one is a cardboard cut-out and everyone has a secret to hide. What I loved about this book was that the story was not rushed. Once I was finished with the book, I felt that everyone was alive in England still going about their business...well, at least the people who survived that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 stars","review":"A bad boy's rougish ways come to a crashing halt when he rejects the wrong woman, the granddaughter of a voodoo queen. Cursed now to be a man only at night and a frog by day for the next month, at the end of which he will be just a frog if he hasn't found true love, Craig Thibedeaux is aided in his quest by his uncle, Joe, and a dog who makes his amphian self a pet. True love turns out to be not exactly his usual type of girl. Rather than a vapid and easy young woman, his salvation takes the form of a brainiac scientist with zero self confidence in her appeal, even though she has a lot of it. Her passion in life is science and research, but under her own self imposed curse has never known love. Each one needs the other to set them free.** Using classic techniques and traditional jokes associated with the Bayou, Ms. James delivers a subtle message underneath this, showing that curses often are blessings in disguise. **"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rampant Revisionism","review":"The author brings a little too much 1990s sensitivity to the 1870s, creating a world which just didn't exist. In the author's view, the indians were good, pure, clean, and represented just about every good quality; while the settlers and cavalry were less-than-bright exploiters of the wilderness and ravagers of the environment and the local populace. This kind of revisionism gets tiresome, and luckily my 10 and 12 year old kids recognized this as well as I did. The author's reliance on politically-correct ideology creates unbelieveable characters and situations. If the author had himself been a settler in Kansas during that time period, I believe we would have had a different point of view in this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and well-paced fantasy","review":"The book has some flaws, most notably that you don't have any idea until the end that the book might be the first of a series, (if it sells well).

Into a future feudalistic society in which Serbians and Croatians are still killing each other, Frankowski dumps \\"hero\\" Micholai Derdowski on an unsuspecting reader. Forcibly enlisted into the Kashubian military and held prisoner by his Mark XIX AI controlled battletank, Frankowski tells a chauvinistic, racially stereotyped story where the super-moral Mickolai can do no wrong, never has to think too much, and is never in any serious danger. With only brief flashes of potentially stunning plot turns that are never realized, Frankowski's book is a bigger bomb then anything launched by his Mark XIX. Cardboard characters, uninteresting pontification, weak dialogue and an obvious conclusion all leave the reader wondering why they bothered in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"FROM A KASZUBIAN (POLISH-AMERICAN) VIEWPOINT...","review":"I appreciate the reviewers who have given impetus to decision on whether to read or not to read.

And having spent a glorious two weeks in Poland in 1999 for the first time in my life (and the first of 10 siblings to do so), I am drawn to anything written by those who care enough about Poland and its heritages and struggles, sci-fi or otherwise. Albeit, translated classics now in print by authors such as Sienkiewicz; and Nobel winner writer/poet Czeslaw Milosz (whom I had the honor of meeting in New York City 1999) are deeper in intellectual content vs. sci-fi of Leo Frankowski (are you Polish Mr. Frankowski?), I salute Mr. Frankowski for anything he touches upon to call attention to the beautiful country of Poland and its heartwarming people.

I returned one copy of this dvd and bought another one and have tried multiple players so i think every copy has this problem. Someone e-mail, message, or comment if they also have this problem so i know it's not just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Elijah Task","review":"Excellent information content.

Unfortunately, I didn't know of him until this year when a friend sent me a link to a YouTube video.If you have not yet watched this 3-minute video for \\"Air Tap\\" (and more than 5 million viewers have!) then get prepared to be blown away. This song is an excellent example of the two-hand tapping technique Mongraine utilizes to coax some pretty amazing sounds from his acoustic guitar. I haven't been this impressed by a debut album from a guitar player in a long time. [And his 2008 follow-up album EQUILIBRIUM is just as good.] VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [Running time - 41:23]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"To the list of fantastic finger style guitarists like Antoine Dufour, Andy McKee, Michael Hedges, and Don Ross I will now be adding Erik Mongrain. As many did I discovered his playing on Youtube, where in addition to the usual \\"playing\\" he also provides an excellent example of the form called \\"lap tapping\\" in which one lays the guitar on its back and proceeds to tap the soundboard with the fingers...Let it be known, potential customer Mongrain is a master at this. I was awestruck. This Cd goes in with the greats. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"And you won't hear that word used too often... by anyone nowadays. Erik Mongrain is Michael Hedges and Andy McKnee rolled into but far more percussive. Seeing live is a trip and he does things I don't think anyone else has been able to replicate live (such as retuning certain strings while playing in order to create harmonies that I've never heard of - and yes, his \\"Air Tap!\\" live is everything it sounds like on the disc... all done in a single take.While he's not quite as melodic as the other two guitar viruosos, he's created something that is just as listenable as those two masters and absolutely places a unique stamp on the instrument of acoustic guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family friendly and funny","review":"This is a family-friendly and funny film about clowns and circus life and the antics of an adorable elephant. Great for a themed weekend with your kids tied together with a trip to your local zoo or circus. Lively and fun! If you're near St. Louis, try it with a visit to Circus Flora, our original one ring summer circus, as Bill Murray is rumored to have learned some of his elephant handling and clown tricks from the pros there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad format","review":"For the content of the movie I give it four stars.

Bill murray is hillarious in every movie he does! this movie was great.. u gotta see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Clean Fun","review":"This was a funtastic movie. I just loved it. I have seen it several times and enjoy every bit of it. I even laugh just thinking about it. Bill Murray is such a funny actor, but it was great to see him in a good clean movie. The movie is wonderful for both kids and adults. Mathew McConaughey was hilarious as the high strung truck driver. Leonard Maltin doesn't know what he is talking about. I actually did not even know that it was McConaughey until I read the Maltin review. The scene with Bill Murray trying to drive the semi-truck brought tears to my eyes, I laughed so hard. I also really enjoyed the scenery in Colorado and New Mexico. If you are tired of the rubbish that Hollywood normally puts out and you want to see a great, clean, and fun movie, you must see larger than life. It is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Movie, Uncredited Source Material","review":"I SUPPOSE you could say the notion of a guy inheriting a female elephant from a dead parent (or parent figure) that he then must travel cross-country with is an idea that could occur to more than one writer ... but it may be just general enough that the originating writer need not be credited. Which is too bad. For LARGER THAN LIFE is clearly an update and paraphrase of the period British novel ROSIE IS MY RELATIVE, written by the late naturalist Gerald Durrell. Though the episodes in the film are quite different from those in the book, the over-arcing story follows a similar trajectory and retains the air of eccentric sweetness. In England, where Durrell was the famous author of several bestsellers (most prominently his autobiographies, which were dramatised for TV), ROSIE IS MY RELATIVE is something of a cult classic. If you find a copy and read it, you'll see why. It's a delightful book. The film owes it much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Murray is great with animals.","review":"I like Bill Murray! He sure knows how to brighten up a person's day with all his comedy actions. Whenever you see a guy like him with an elephant, though, be prepared to have your sides split. He and the elephant get into certain mishaps and mix ups. If you like elephants and you like Bill Murray, this is the movie that you are looking for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lesson #1: Never try to follow an animal act...","review":"Unless you are Bill Murray! Clearly one of the most adaptable actors of his generation, this lovely film offers up a character at odds with himself, and you soon believe that he is the only one capable of pulling off the role. It's easy to see his predicaments, and the main one is large indeed. Vera should have gotten a \\"best supporting animal\\" award, and Murray has freely admitted that their on-screen relationship was wonderful. It shows.Without going into all the encounters that Murray's character has to deal with, it is best to say that the most unforgettable person in this film is an uncredited Matthew McConaughey. That he appears to be on the wrong side of nervous paranoia is an understatement, and that the target of his rage is just one simple step ahead of him... One GIANT step! Fun for the whole family, it deserved more of an audience than it got. But money doesn't mean everything; this one's a very enjoyable gem that you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Worst CD I've ever purchased. I heard one song on the radio. Made the same mistake everyone else does. Thinking the whole CD was like that, bought the stupid thing. It's just a bunch of noise, with one musical track. Please Please listen to the samples before you buy. I blame myself for not listening. The little bits you hear are exactly what the whole track will sound like. There's no variation. Oh, and get this, one of the tracks has random super high-pitched tones in it. I bet Mr Guy Called Gerald thought he'd done something cool no-one else had done before.

Since reading her book I've set a number of PRs for long rides, due in large part to changing my pre-ride and recovery eating habits. I strongly recommend this book to any endurance athlete who wants to feel better while running or cycling.

I found Monique Ryan's book to be one of the most satisfying sources of well researched information available. Monique's book is short on fluff and big on information. It's refreshing to find a well organized, conscisely written nutritonal manual for athletes who want to maximize their training methods with facts rather than hype. I make it required reading for the athletes that I work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the neophyte, nothing new","review":"This is a good book to have if you know nothing about nutrition and want to learn some of the basics. You can collect all the basic information here through general Internet research. True, it's nice to have it all in one place in a logical format, but I really expected much more detailed advice for a book targeted specifically to endurance athletes than 'you need to manage your carbohydrates over the length of the event'-type advice. Not worth the money in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good synopsis","review":"I was very disappointed to hear the comments made in regards to this book not being revolutionary. The reason the Paleo diet is not included in this book is because the Paleo diet is not an effective diet for athletes, especially endurance athletes. If you don't believe me ask Lance Armstrong how much pasta he eats during the Tour de France. This book is an excellent source of info regarding endurance nutrition and I recommend it to athletes looking for proven strategies for endurance nutrition not controversial diets."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned my copy","review":"Some cutting edge nutritional information from this 2012 edition would have made it useful, but after a cursory look through the book, decided to return it. The book is outdated in several ways. Nothing on intramuscular fat, which is now thought to be the primary fuel for endurance exercise. Too many recipes are bland and aversive to fat - low fat cheese, skim milk, light mayo and tofu. Yuk. Few of the many controversial facts were directly referenced; the bibliography at the end of the book was also largely outdated. I returned this book and instead bought The Feed Zone Cookbook: Fast and Flavorful Food for Athletes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bunch of old, tired, and general advice","review":"Truly disappointed in this book. Nothing in here about any of the more recent (say last 3 years) nutritional developments -- e.g., \\"paleo\\" diet for endurance athletes, etc. All this book contains is the same old, and rather boring, nutritional retoric that you can find in just about any issue of Triathlete magazine you pick up. Additionally, the author really only glosses over issues like the glycemic index and its impace on nutritional strategy for pre-race fueling, race fueling and post-race recovery. She recommends foods which are high in processed sugars and highly-processed grains for normal eating, but doesn't even attempt to explain or express contrary views about the value of these foods to an athlete.Bottom line: If you have been following sports nutrition at all, you will find nothing new or interesting here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as it was billed...","review":"Blue PlanetI was disappointed to see that the book, promised to be unread, had indeed been read.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that it had an intriguing plot, that it actually had some basis in history, and that the characters were mostly well crafted, especially that of Milady. I must say that, for me, French Romanticism is an acquired taste and I was turned off by the exagerations that Romantic works put forth. The plot was very intricate and, although it depended on so much coincidence as required by its genre, it all worked well. The test of a book for me is: did I become engrossed in it. The answer for the Three Musketeers is yes, at least most of the time. A worthy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocabulary too advanced to hold childrens' attention","review":"I bought this classic novel on cd thinking it would hold the interest of my 2 grade school boys, who enjoy books on cd while driving to and from school.

A bust for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to its reputation","review":"Many books have had the word \\"classic\\" hung upon them for many reasons. Few though deliver the goods on as many levels as does this novel. This book is funny, alarming, exciting, sad, and thought-provoking. The three buddies are sort of seventeenth-century drunken brats with swords whose hearts are nevertheless in the right place and win through at the end to save an empire. There are places in the book that are simply funny, something that Hollywood has keyed on. There is a ridiculous aspect to the whole thing that is veiled only thinly in the book. The book has some really sad twists and the ending will make anyone think. At the end, though, most readers will agree that this book stands by itself and richly deserves the appellation \\"classic.\\" The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the outdated language."},{"rating":"2","title":"dumas is exciting","review":"a thrilling story. i find parts ofensive being a woman and not liking the way they lived but the story is ingaging and you cant really start the story without knowing our little group are a bunch of wominizers so as long as you set that aside its a fun read though of course its still there. id not recomemend it to my daughters but I dont prevent them from reading it either. you have to love a classic and how they make you think and this one has a lot of riotus fun reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three Musketeers","review":"The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas.

This is one of the worst recordings of all time. You know, I was 19 when this came out, and, I must admit, I was a Dio fan (I used a lot of drugs back then) but when this came out, my buddy bought it and we both hated it. We tried to get into it, but we just found it to be boring and tiresome. We didn't even go to the Dio concert that year, we were just so let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"Dio's last album with Vivian Campbell. Great vocals but just terrible lyrics and the guitar work just doesn't measure up. This is where Dio's mystery lyrics get just downright annoying: meaningless and generic. 'Last In Line' is the last good album Dio made: avoid 'Sacred Heart' and everything released afterwards as it just doesn't measure up in music and the 'magic' lyrics just get cheesier and cheesier. Dio's best stuff is with Sabbath and Rainbow really. He also did two great tracks with Kerry Livgren on 'Seeds of Change': 'Living for the King' and 'Mask of the Great Deceiver.' That's something you wont hear anywhere else, Dio singing Christian rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"... A PERFECT WORK OF ART!","review":"This Dio's Japanese mini-lp replica version album is simply a work of art!

Theres just no way he could follow up The Last in Line with this one. The songs sound like throwaways from the last album, i.e, filler. Vivian Campbell is in rare uninspired form (at least for his pre Def Leppard days) and the rest of the band just sounds tired. There are a few good songs, but they're few and far between. If you're a Dio fan who doesn't need everything and has the first two, skip this one and get Dream Evil instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dio is the king of Rock n' Roll!!!!!","review":"Ahh, the beauty of youth, with all of her waywardness...Dio captures that in this album.

Wanna rock? Listen to \\"Sacred Heart\\"!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's wrong with you people? This is dull","review":"I really enjoyed Ronnie's first two albums, particularly \\"Holy Diver\\". However, this time out he starts to sound stale. If you have listened to his work with Rainbow and Sabbath along with the first two solo albums, you will have heard every idea here.

I read all of the reviews on the hammer and one concerned me. John Crawford reviewed it on October 30, 2000. He wrote that it is a cool hammer to nail nails but not to pull nails. He broke the handle after the third or forth nail. He's right, I didn't even have mine on the job for two days. I pulled a couple nails with it and then nailed a 16d nail and the head broke off. The handle is way to thin which goes into the head. Don't get me wrong I fell in love with the hammer the first day but to be a every day framing hammer not a hammer to have. I had to break out old faithfull, my Estwing. I still have my old $15.00 framing hammer when I first started in construction over 10 years ago. If they can figure out to make the handle stronger then the Stiletto is a must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK nailer But horrible on the job site.","review":"I got the hammer some time ago and thought it was awsome at first, until I tried to use it at work. I am rough framer, and use my hammer about a hundred times a day. This hammer is cool nailing nails But what they don't tell you is that you're not allowed to pull nails with it. I didn't know that until I pulled the third or fourth nail and the head of the hammer fell off. If you like the feel of a lightweight titanium hammer, and you are going to use it, I suggest that you go with the Death stick. It weighs the same and the handle doesn't break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hammer I've ever used","review":"This hammer is the best thing that ever happened to my wrists and elbow. The nail setter has proven indespensible when absolutely needed, and at other times it has increased my safety, because I don't have to lean over a roof edge or on a ladder with two hands anymore. The lighter weight head doesn't slow nailing a bit. When you use it everyday the cost is well-justified. The only drawback is that you can't put alot of pressure on the handle, but I have not had any problems pulling nails. Oh, and the ladies love the looks of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"elbow saver","review":"I am a carpenter of nearly 20 years and my elbow on my right arm hurt so bad from years of hammering that I taught myself to hammer left handed.

I work on a construction crew, and do numberous odd jobs. I do like this hammer a lot. It's very light, which is great for not weighing down my toolbelt. It also does not put much stress on my elbow. I was using a heavier hammer, and I could start to feel a twinge in my tendons. The long handle is great, especially since I am not too tall. The nail set is great again to extend my reach. I haven't had any problems pulling nails, even the old rusty ones. I think my next hammer might be a Dalluge.

I dare you to find such footage of any other band. So many other complete performances that are also wonderful - I Saw Her in Washington 1964 - I Am The Walrus from MMT - The Long and Winding Road - the list goes on. If you love the Beatles - treat yourself - if you know someone who loves them - don't let them go on without owning this fantastic gift from Apple. Don't wait for a birthday or Christmas.

It took me less than a week to watch because I was glued to the television, watching eleven hours of footage. There were concerts, interviews with the three remaining Beatles at the time, music videos, clips from their wonderful movies, and oh so much more. Anyone that is a Beatles fan AT ALL would LOVE this set!!! If you are considering buying it, stop considering! Buy it right away! The book and accompanying cds are also done with the utmost in quality and detail, and I have loved them these few months that I have been begun my Beatlemania!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It!","review":"I loved it. A definite must have for any Beatle fan. The Special Feature section is probably the best part.

The highlight is , of course, finally seeing Paul, George and Ringo sing a few songs together. It is a joyous, magical thing to watch. And at the same time, a sad moment that makes you wonder what kind of great music we could have heard if they had reunited for an album. But at least we have these few minutes of the greatest pop group ever singing together one last time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tribute to a great band","review":"If you are like me, and missed the broadcasting of this series, and even if you didnt i highly recommened getting this set. This DVD set has 2-3 hours of film not seen on TV, and a bonus 5th disk full of specail features. I saw my friends VHS collection of the anthology and after watching the DVD's, i was amazed by better picture, better sound, and even the much rumored jam session of Paul, George, and Ringo. I must say that altough this set is long , over 11 hours, its still quicker then reading the book(which i recommened), but if you want the songs with out alot of the talking, i recommened buying the cd sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"best documentary ever","review":"The best part of this documentary is that there is no narrator. All parts of the story are described using pictures/sound clips/videos/commentary from the Beatles themselves, which makes for a very inciteful watch.Plus, because each Beatle has a different personality, you get a mostly objective view. Paul is always trying to smooth arguments and rivalry over, George is cynical about the 60's in general, Ringo is friendly, and John (taken from past interviews) is always inciteful.It was very interesting and it kept my attention throughout the entire 8 hour film. One thing I wish they had done was focus more time for the later years as a band (IMO when they made their best music), but it is hurried a bit. Of course, that is only relative since they spend 2 1/2+ hours on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatle's Anthology","review":"Great stuff. I was there at the San Diego concert in 1965.

At a time when a lot of guys their age had to worry about the draft (and being sent to a bloodbath worse than Iraq), the Beatles' biggest problem was being locked in hotel suites while adoring young girls screamed outside.

When the TV'Anthology' aired in 1995 that was pretty amazing enough, then came the VHS set with four more hours not shown on TV. Now with the DVD Anthology, Beatles fans get all that and more (particularly of interest on the bonus disc is seeing and hearing Paul, George & Ringo jam on early rock n roll songs, andthen in Abbey Road studios discussing the making of \\"Tommorow Never Knows\\"). Also what I thought especially of interest is how they very carefully placed John's video and audio contributions at the right moments (as they did also with the Anthology book, which I also recommend as a companion to the DVD set)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Criminal that it is not on DVD","review":"This set is amazing.

If you're a Beatles fan, you won't be disappointed. If you're not a big fan, it will turn you into one.I see people actually complaining because there's not enough music on this DVD set. Are you joking? Of the ten hours of material, probably close to half of it is music. Besides, this is the only documentary out there where The Beatles get to tell their story in their own words.

I still have a catalog from then to prove it. I was very impressed with the sound quality. The best sound quality I've ever heard Beatles music presented in. Makes me wish my old Beatles CDs sounded that good. On alot of my other DVD's I have to crank the volume way up to get any decent audio. The only thing I didn't like is that during some of the songs like \\"Revolution\\" & \\"Hey Jude\\" there is talking. I'm interested in what they have to say but not during the songs. And it doesn't seem to have a feature where you can just play the music videos. But I guess it's supposed to be a documentary & not a collection of music videos. Also I seem to recall some minor scenes when I saw it on TV in 1995 that weren't on the DVD, like the reunited Beatles in the 90's admiring one of the member's fancy car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles Anthology","review":"This is the best documentary of The Beatles ever released,maybe because the three remaining Beatles had a large part in the making of it.A must for any serious Beatle fan !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Expensive?

This is an excellent series that traces the history of the Beatles from their pre-Beatle days to their breakup. It's narrated by the surviving members of the bad with some clever integration of older interviews with John Lennon.It's also a complete recording of their greatest hits as well. Each of their big hits is played in full with excellent video and film images. I still get goosebumps when I think of the images of the Beatles walking across Shea stadium in front of thousands of screaming fans.The series doesn't dull or lose focus.

My only complaint about this series is the fact that squashed the White Album, Let It Be, and Abbey Road all into one episode.

This is a great way to hear a lot of the classic songs in a really well-mastered format though. In fact, it's a charming little collection for the most part, but it does something I never thought a King Crimson collection would do: edit and abridge the songs!Classics such as Starless, Islands, Exiles and Moonchild have all been cut down! All of my favorite songs are cut down to radio singles; this makes the collection hard to listen to. It might not bother a new fan though, as they don't know what the songs should sound like. Also most of the Lizard album got shafted, kind of lame.This is an ok item for beginners, but as a starting point I would probably recommend getting the 'Young Person's Guide to King Crimson' or the 4-cd live box 'The Great Deceiver' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank heavens I read the critical review","review":"I wasn't fortunate enough to see this early masterpiece on the big screen (or haven't been yet) but thank heavens I read the critical review and avoided wasting money on the BluRay/DVD Combo. I agree completely about the AIR soundtrack; its truly atrocious for a film of this age and genre. Unfortunately it seriously detracts from what should be an acclaimed critical achievement. If you are considering purchasing this product, take the previous reviewer's advice (actually, the advice they didn't offer) and check it out on the net first. A five minute exerpt with the AIR soundtrack did it for me. Sigh. I guess I'll just have to wait till its released with a palatable alternative soundtrack or watch it silently.

Driver moved it into my garage and helped me take it off the skid, and took the skid away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Machine for the Price","review":"I purchased this machine as an upgrade in my shop from a bench type planer. Initially, I thought I would like to buy a larger planer, but have found the thirteen inch capacity to be more than sufficient for my needs. The machine planes efficiently, and thickness settings are accurate upon initial calibration. Changing thickness is easily accomplished without the effort required for many smaller planers. The machine is sufficiently heavy to support large boards during planing, and the built in retractable wheels are wonderful, allowing easy relocation of the machine in the shop and good stability for planing while they are in the raised position. The infeed and outfeed roller supports are easily adjusted and well constructed. When properly set up they virtually eliminate snipe. When coupled with a dust collection system, the built in dust hood removes virtually all the chips. I am impressed! This is an exceptional machine for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Censored!","review":"I love this album but its censored!

I must be wrong because people love this CD and I don't. The sound that emanates from the \\"dirty south\\" is all about being gangsta and spending money foolishly... topics that I found tiresome in the early 90's when it was still relatively fresh.There is one song that makes an attempt to address social issues, but it comes off as contrived due to the rest of the album's topics of interest. How can you rap about local politics forcing one into a life of crime as being a bad thing when you glorify the fruits of your \\"labor\\" the rest of the album?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Emile Henry Stand behind the Warranty?","review":"Emile Henry is suppose to have a 3 year Warranty against defects.

I called Amazon at the time and they stated would have to contact Emile Henry direct. But, they couldn't tell me where I was suppose to contact them. Well finally about 2 weeks ago I started doing the research on this by googleing emile henry warranty and found the phone number. I now have placed my second call to them and my second e mail to them as of today. They never responded to my left message or my first email I placed 2 weeks ago.

He manages to keep alive the the thrill of discovery while stressing the amount of research, hard work and danger involved in uncovering the secrets of the Arabia. Rarely in non-fiction do we meet characters like Norman Storer. Most importantly, Hawley and his cohorts bring modern sensibilities to treasure hunting at a time when many of us are rethinking the purposes of archaeology, paleontology, other sciences and the role museums should play in educating the public by maintaining the past. I highly recommend this reading for anyone interested in history, restoration, preservation, and especially for the thousands of people out there who have become hooked on steamboatin'. For you - this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Useful","review":"I have read this book three times and have used it as a reference many more times. Its research is as involved as the actual digging of the Arabia. Hawley uses the suspense of the next discovery and the frustration of digging in watery sand to make an actual plot for an archeological dig. Hawley's amateur enthusiasm is contagious and comes off the page in true professionalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I was not pleased with my order at all.

The stories are classic in the sense that they have some of the original characters and some of the original themes, but they are slightly condensed. For example, we read the story \\"101 Dalmations\\" one night, and the story ended happily but prematurely. My wife and I looked at each other quizzically because we knew there was much more to the story, but my daughter enjoyed it. It appears some of the stories are edited to fit in the short format, which is fine if that is what you expect. When I read the other reviews and the description, I expected full length stories. This book is very good and we thoroughly enjoy the stories, but if you want complete stories that are \\"Classic Disney\\" you won't get them here. Prepare for a slightly condensed version of classic stories. Overall, still a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disney Story Book","review":"I was pleased with this book. Not only are the stories classic, the colorful pictures will attract a young child's attention. The only disappointment was the quality of paper used.

However, do not rush to newer, fancier looking commentaries--quite yet. William Lane has much to teach in this commentary and it is still worth the effort to carefully work through his reflections on Mark's gospel. I have used this commentary regularly in the years that I have been preparing sermons on the gospel of Mark and it has been a trusted and trustworthy companion.

Being a music nerd, I wanted to read some hardcore fandom over The Replacements. I learned nothing about the band that I didn't already know. This is more of a musing of Colin Meloy's coming-of-age with music in general. It doesn't seem to fit with the 33 1/3 series.Also, I wanted to see more of a voice in the writing. It's not bad, and there were snippets where I thought, Yes! This is what this book should be! But too much of it meanders in a very basic fashion that feels more like a book report than an inspired memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, but not really about the album","review":"Meloy's book is a decent autobiographical look at his experiences discovering music as a child, but it really tells you nothing about the making of (or meaning of) the Replacements' most famous album.After reading the incredible 33 1/3 book on Paul's Boutique, I was expecting to actually learn about the Replacements, or about the creation of Let It Be. Instead, I learned about Meloy's childhood buddy and hiship uncle who introduced him to music. The book was indeed well-written, but not at all what I was expecting.If you want to learn about the making of Let it be, STAY AWAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd prefer a book about the Replacements, thank you","review":"How annoying is this?

I was interested in the sounds and the songs and the methods for making this great record. What I got was the memoirs of a flavor of the month indie rock singer talking in way too much detail about mix tapes from middle school.

Thank God I borrowed it from a library rather than plunking down my hard earned cash for it. After reading the installment in their series on In Utero I was shocked - SHOCKED - to be confronted with the self indulgent and lazy prattle in this slim volume. Not only is there precious little about the album (which I thought these books were supposed to focus on the making of), but this autobiography is also peppered with editorial mistakes, e.g., the use of \\"it's\\" when \\"its\\" would have been correct, describing a car doing a \\"360\\" when he actually meant \\"180\\" (a mistake that's \\"Presidential\\", in the Bush sense). Please, 33-1/3 publishers, exercise a little quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jigga?","review":"The most self-indulgent words from one of the most boring songwriters in indie rock (though the Decemberists are no longer indie and never came close to rocking) -- this book has nothing to do with the 'Mats. I'm not objecting to the author's use of memoir as commentary about the album, I'm objecting to the unapplicablity of the album to the narrative. Also, I think Colin Meloy should refund the $12 I spent to see his band live.

I remember seeing t-shirts here and there of Wehrmacht, but never actually heard them until now. I must say that the other reviews are right on as far as the description of their sound, but I personally don't care for this band one bit. Just a lot of very fast NOISE to me. I don't think they sound like any of the mentioned bands, either. Their sound is very unique; just pure speed. The vocalist is terrible, but I did find some of the guitar work good. Sorry, but don't get this if you're expecting to hear early Megadeth, Slayer or Kreator... These guys were their own sound.

The two kittens in this book are getting into mischief on every page, from popping balloons the father cat has just blown up to painting their stuffed animals with face paint and sneaking off to eat candy in the corner. Yet there is no correction and the story is basically about how cute they are. It is no wonder that children behave so much worse than they did a couple of generations ago. Our grandparents and parents read stories about children who received appropriate consequences for their actions (those original fairy tales where everything didn't always turn out sunshine and roses) and learned something. Our children will read this book and hear the message that being disobedient is cute and desirable.

Jim can't be himself around women and scares them off, and Alan wants to be the world's best skier. That 20 minute plot is wrapped around 40 minutes of music. It is almost makes no sense. The film (all 59 minutes of it) also makes the now-defunct Club Med Copper Mountain look like a pretty boring place. This also reminded me of those specials they used to release in syndication to independent television stations during the 80s.

Thankfully he found work in films that are actually worth watching. Copper Mountain has to be one of the top ten worst movies I have ever seen. The majority of the movie focuses on that no talent band that plays at the resort. Jim Carrey is listed first on the IMDB cast list, even though he has very few lines. The bottom line of the plot doesn't amount to anything more than Carrey's character Bobby Todd can't be himself around women, flies down a mountain on skis with his arms flailing around, he wipes out and two girls help him up, then all of a sudden he can be himself. And Alan Thicke's character Jackson Reach wants to compete in a skiing competition, and gets beat by an overweight bartender in a race for the final spot in the competition. The bartender Yogi later drops his spot in the race and gives it to Jackson.

Copper Mountain is one of the latter. There is absolutely no reason to watch this, not even if you are a die hard Jim Carrey fan. This is half lame plot about a ski competition and half really talentless and annoying country music concert. Of all the bad movies I have seen this is the most boring and pointless of them all. The production values aren't as bad as Z-movie sci-fi classics like the Beast of Yucca Flatts, but the production here is still crap.

The bad plot is only equaized by bad sound editing and really bad performances by a young Alan Thicke and Jim Carrey.Funny thing is that I would at least expect it to be a good ad for Club Med since it appears this was sort of an early version of an infomercial. It doesn't even do a good job at that or showcasing Copper Mountain for that matter. It's bad plot, bad movie, bad infomercial, bad, bad, bad.Interesting side note: The (at the time) super-deluxe Club Med at Copper now serves a different purpose... It's used for employee housing.

Then you are hit like a brick wall with the last page: the horse is abruptly taken away from the children to the \\"high pasture\\" never to be seen or heard from again (presumably to die).

On the entire cd there's a sensible aura of legend, which also comes out from the intense lyrics of each title, other than from the excellent performances of the band. Buy this album, and you won't regret it. You will find you returning to listen it another time, and then another time, and then..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst female vocal ever","review":"I bought this CD a month ago because I am a huge fan of power & progressive melodic metal. But nobody warned me that the lead vocalist Federica 'Sister' is awfull singer. I don't mind her voice cause it's OK. I hate the style of singing, like she has closed jaws all the time. And the very low point was the start of the album when I heard the singer of Grave Digger.... I don't like his singing too. Overally, the album has some good tunes but again Federica's singing ruins it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left wanting more!","review":"I love her music.

It's all about CDs and MP3s. Anyway, \\"Put Your Records On\\" is boring. It's a \\"safe\\" song that lacks any bass, groove, or melody. It actually sounds childish and is void of any emotion or excitement. Basically, it's FLAT and it's the type of song you hear being played at Eat N' Park early in the morning while the senior citzens sit around, sipping their coffee and reading the paper. \\"Put Your Records On\\" will be forgotten like last week's Ramen noodles when checks come out on the first of the month and you can afford to buy Spaghetti-O's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great change for my Tacoma","review":"Looks fine, if you didn't know what the OEM panel looked like, it is unlikely you would know it is an aftermarket item. You can't just screw it in place in the factory mounting locations without it wiggling it a bit though. This is easily remedied by either installing some washers behind the mounts to change the angle at which it sits or inserting a small shim at the bottom where it butts into the A/C controls. I did the shim, because I didn't feel like pulling the unit out. Now it sits solid.Having the pocket there is great also, plenty of room for Phone and ipod... Which is why I changes out OEM Stereo to one that can integrate those."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes, people","review":"This Cd is very good. I got it because it was new, but I did not really know who ghostface was, but I bought it and this was pleasing. The only prtoblem is that some of the songs are messed up and I think I heard two versions of one song, and they were completely different. One of them was not on the album. In the booklet they mention 21 songs, but there are only 14 tracks.

Ghostface has some lyrical genius which he showcases on \\"nutmeg\\" and \\"one.\\" Those are two of my favorite jams on the album. I was a little disappointed in releases from GZA, Meth and O.D.B. But I knew this would be good, I just knew it. This brings you back to the Shaolin feel. You'll love this CD if you even just liked 36 Chambers or Wu Forever.

Sophomore releases from Meth,Raekwon, Old Dirty and U-God have been somewhat dissapointing. Inspectah Deck and GZA followed up with pretty good joints but not as hot as Ghostface's \\"Supreme Clientele\\". The tightest cuts are \\"Nutmeg\\", \\"The Grain\\", \\"Apollo Kids\\" especially tha sweet \\"Cherchez LaGhost\\".Buy this one, you wont regret it....simply a classic ....I hope the upcoming Wu album will be as hot...coming out on Nov. 7, dont sleep on it"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Greatest Albums","review":"This album is well written and produced. Sensational album for everyone to listen to. From the begining skit to the very last, all 21 tracks on this album keep you in the mood. This album is filled with quick samples and interesting vibes that make you say. Did Mathematics or Rza do that? An amazing accomplishment by the ironman. Tony Starks Interprises, Iron man back ups, and a few other little kung fu throw in's between the tracks and you have a classic Wu Tang album. Pick this album up its well worth the money.

This is the best album of the year 2000 in any genre, let alone hip-hop. Ghostface is the illest MC, the production is mind-blowing, every damn song is a classic. I put this CD in with a few others, hit shuffle, and I find myself remarking EVERY time a cut from this CD comes on how great it is. If you like the Wu even a little, get this disc NOW. It is essential for any lover of real hip-hop. 'Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST OF 2000","review":"Ghostface Supreme Clientele is the best album of 2000. Ghostface lyrics are tighter then ever. Rza with this and Ghost Dog sdtk proves that he is one of the best producers in the game. From start to end every track on Ghost is blazing. Even on the backscratch joint \\"Stroke Of Death\\" is ill to me. I still can't decide which is better \\"Ironman\\" or \\"Surpreme Clientele\\" both are hip hop classics forever. Ghostface gives the Wu their best record in a while (even better then The W). Hard to pick a favorite track, because ever track is ill. The 2 I'll pick are \\"Nutmeg\\", and \\"Child's Play\\".

Where this sound is almost common now, it's PERFECT here. Never boring. Always fresh.Ghostface is probably one of the best MCs ever. I don't have to say he doesn't spit anything but, well, perfection. I'm not going to really go on. In a just world, Jay Z would be [...].

But I was disappointed again by the Wu. There are three problems with this album: the beats, the lyrics and the vocal delivery. In other words, there's not much I can praise about it. The beats are mostly repetitive samples from old soul tunes. The soundscapes are at their best dull, and at worst irritating. The lyrics are too esoteric - Ghostface Killah's jargon is often unpenetrable. The lyrical content becomes unintelligible and is reduced to background noise - which is great if you're looking for wallpaper music. The vocal delivery is flat and monotone - there are no interesting changes in rythmn, tone or accent. Very little to please me here. As a fan of the Wu's early work, I'm disappointed again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supremely disappointing.","review":"The only things that saved this album from getting only one star were the excellent production and the guest MCs. Ghost himself was just very disappointing. His lyrics just didn't flow. He sounded like he was just out of step with the beats...they just didn't blend very well. The fact that the music and the vocals seemed out of sync tended to grate on my ears...I just couldn't listen to the album for very long. Major disappointment. What happened Mr. Starks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghostface Killah takes the downfall","review":"Yo, this is a HUGE dissapointment y'all. I was looking forward to a album full of dope beats & Ghost's unorthodox vocal mentality to go with 'em, but what I got was a buttload of bugged-out joints with a couple of 'em standing out. Ghostface Killah's \\"Supreme Clientele\\" is truly trash. It's nothing but a bunch of old Beverly Hillbilies samples and wack cameos. Aren't you tired of seeing Red & Meth together? I know I am. The only and I mean THE only highlights on this album are \\"Nutmeg\\", \\"One\\", \\"Malcolm\\", \\"Mighty Healthy\\", and \\"Wu Banga 101\\". To end this humiliation toward Ghost, Wu fans, and people thinking about buying the album, your better off buying Inspectah Deck's \\"Uncontrolled Substance\\".

After calling Cisco support, who admitted being able to recreate the issue, they had no fix and basicly ceased to respond to any further request for support. Beyond that the router would disconnect from the internet frequently which required power cycling to get the router working again. One tech finally took ownership and allowed an RMA to be generated.

Speeds are impressive, but as many others have noted, the system hangs up at random times driving users to distraction.

The documentation if fairly limited, and the help explanations are ambiguous. The menus are not straight forward. It was difficult to configure some fairly simple access control. The controls were limited, and it took Cisco support days to answer questions. They eventually had to resort to reading the source code to figure out the answer to my questions. When limitations on the manufacturer claims were discovered, the answer was, \\"Well this is an entry level router\\" despite feature claims. VPN is 3DES only. The first router also suffered from sudden death while configuring access controls and came up in a partially configured state that would not allow further configuration. Had to RMA the product back to Cisco.All-in-all I am very disappointed in this router, and 2 stars is generous.

Its core security feature, IPS, turns our 35/35mbps FiOS connection into roughly 20/12, and it prevents our FiOS Video On Demand from functioning properly - video looks totally corrupt and scrambled.

I finally got fed up with how slow the Internet was performing, so I plugged my Time Capsule back in. Voila... speeds were lightning fast again and my mail magically started working.

I tried troubleshooting everything, firmware, etc.Finally, I started noticing the posts on overheating. That was it. This thing heats up and the WiFi shuts down. They all do it. I had it configured for a VPN (which also would drop off), and figured if I bought a new one I could upload the config without reprogramming it. I did this, and after about a week, same thing, WiFi dropped, VPN dropped, and it was sizzling hot.This product should never, ever have been released for sale. What a sad joke.

No real alternatives are given, and those that are suggested are extremely expensive. If an air attack would cause 50 billion worth in damages, spending 40 billion is okay according to the writers.If you would want a book telling the Bush administration finds it difficult to tie their own shoes, look no further. This is the book you want.What decided me to trash this book was the opinion of the writers that not only Turkey should join the EU, but joining Egypt wouldn't be a bad idea either.

Peppered thoughout the text are helpful French expressions translated into English such as \\"Do you have a ladder so I can reach your airmail clerk suspended from the ceiling?\\" You can read some guest comments for the hotels which of course, are also bizarre, and learn about special services such as a kidnapping service or a food tasting service (so you don't get poisoned).

That said, the information is there and goes from the basic intervals to complex chord structures, but most experienced composers/musicians would start reading at about two third into the book.This is an interesting book, more interesting for giving an insight into the great Mr Tchaikovsky than studying harmony and for that I would buy it again.

But if you want an edgy new version of these classics, you will be in for a treat.Some of the songs remind me a little of George Thorogood while others have the more traditional blues feel, while others have a definite Aerosmith flavor.

You can count on one hand the number of times that Perry gets to take a solo without Tyler screaming his nuts off over the top of it and reducing it all to a mind numbing cacophony. The overall effect is to over clutter the mix, a blues singer he ain't and the word restraint ain't in his dictionary.Shame really because after about three listens, I can honestly say that there a about three tracks that I can bear to listen to repeatedly, mainly because someone had the sense to glue Tylers immense mouth shut for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say, Aerosmith laid an egg with this one.","review":"I saw from (some of) the other 164 reviews (so far) that this was reviewed very positively.

I saw them as far back as Cal Jam II (with Foreigner, Heart, Nugent, etc), and have 15 of their albums going back to 1973, but this is the first (and hopefully ONLY) one that doesn't even have one good track. It's just boring. I won't argue with the many others who like it; I'll just say it's not for me. If you're new to Aerosmith and like them, I'd suggest you get the album \\"Rocks\\" or \\"Toys in the Attic\\" instead of this one (for early albums) or \\"Pump\\" or \\"Get a Grip\\" (later albums). This just isn't that same polished hard rock I knew and liked and expected from the guys. Again, the BAND is hot, no question, but this specific album is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"20 Years to Late","review":"This was a good idea that DOES NOT work out....Timing is everything and Aerosmith has been around and enjoyed success for a long time butthis is a album that should have been thought of in the 1980's before time took its toll on one of the better rock & Roll bands.....To the point......It stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho hum","review":"I'm not really an Aerosmith fan, but I've been listening to the blues for about half a century, and play a little Strat myself. Subtract the 19 cent keychain and Aerosmith's previous arena-rock reputation, and what's left is mostly a very, very ordinary CD. Two or three tracks have interesting interpretations, and a comparison of the band's \\"Never Loved a Woman\\" to The Commitments' cover of \\"Never Loved a Man\\" is fun, but on the whole, It feels like I got about $3 worth of good rock / blues for my $13.99. That's not what I consider a \\"good value\\" for my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuk","review":"This Cd stinks of a 7 day old corpse. Its old songs redone, nothing new. Why cant Aerosmith write 14 or so new songs and realese them, is their creativity shot or what. Dont buy this cd it is awlful."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNORIGINAL","review":"I so much wanted this to be a great album. What a wasted opportunity. Aerosmith has never been subtle, but subtlety is just what they needed here. You want to hear a great blues CD get Boz Scagg's homage to the great ones \\"Come On Home\\". Get \\"Toys\\" or \\"Rocks\\" if you want a great Arerosmith CD. \\"Honkin on Bobo\\" is an overinflated, overproduced, Rock Album wanting to be the Blues. Sounds like every other Aerosmith album done since the late 1970's. Nothing original here."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing","review":"Im a huge aerosmith fan...I have loved them from day one...but they have let me down with this cd. i have loved every cd but this.

Anything after that particular record has been complete garbage, sorry to say, and this blues wannabe CD is no exception.Tyler and co. should hang it up, but you know they won't anytime soon, since they love their inexplicable fame way too much.For music with a true message, check out Jackal 'n' Slade, not to mention Van Halen, who might be reuniting with Roth soon. Let's hope that's the case!!!!!!ENJOY YOUR DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes me wanna cry!","review":"Good grief! I can't believe Aerosmith even believes that's the blues! I'm a big fan since the '70s but -unfortunately for Steven Tyler- I'm also a blues fan and harmonica player. Why didn't you hire Kim Wilson better? Come to think of it, I wouldn't want to put Kim's playing into THAT album! Steven's harp playing is pathetic, specially that terrible bent warble he insists on. The music is a far cry from the blues, too loud and \\"wall of sound\\" guitars. Blues? I don't think so... and neither the rock fans nor the blues fans are going to like it. My recomendation is that Aerosmith better stick to ballads like Amazing... now THAT is their cup of tea!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than 1 star- perhaps a quasar","review":"This new Aerosmith platter is one huge heaping pile of dog-doo. I feel completely ripped off by a band that I used to absotutely looooove. No imagination ventured, nothing gained by owning this crap. Stay away. Don't even buy used. If you get this fecal matter for a present, discard in the biohazardous waste bin with the used needles and jimmy caps. Dammit, Stevie-boy, how many facelifts will it take for you to start writing some quality material again? Apparently all those 'Ludes and Mary-Jane tokes back in the 70's did cause some brain damage after all. And Joseph Perry, how could you let your good name be associated with such excrement? I would expect it from Whitford, but not YOU- of the Toxic Twins!!! This music is so obsolete it makes me retch. For God's sake please listen to some Led Zep albums and get back to me in 2 years. We'll keep the light on for ya!-David J Newman 2004"},{"rating":"1","title":"less would have been more","review":"This is about as much a blues disc as the latest Britney Spears disc. Aerosmith took a bunch of already over-recorded songs and literally beat them to death. Pounding drums, wailing guitars, screechy vocals - to say it's over produced would be putting it politely. They should have gotten a producer that is familiar with the blues to show them that not every disc has to have songs tailor made for arenas. With so many good REAL blues musicians out there having their recordings virtually ignored, the publicity these guys are getting should be a crime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I just got this album yesterday and I can't stop listening to it. It sounds like a mix of the best of all efforts from their earliest blues-rock (1973, Aerosmith - Dream On) to their current pop-rock releases. What's really refreshing is to hear a bunch of classic blues tunes done in a style that is distinctively Aerosmith. All the while each member (Steve, Joe, Tom, Brad and Joey) show that they are capable of improving their musical talents even after all these years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC AEROSMITH","review":"THE GUYS ARE AT THE TOP OF THEIR GAME WITH THIS ONE.AFTER 30+ YEARS THE TOXIC TWINS SOUND BETTER THAN EVER.THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BANDS OF ALL TIME,NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.I'M JUST HAPPY THAT I WAS PART OF IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Album Title / Lousy CD","review":"Aerosmith's idea to do a Blue's flavored album was a great one, nice package, catchy Album title, but then the music doesn't deliver. The first four tracks are decent, but after that it just goes downhill. Not enough variety in the style's of songs, and the vocals aren't as bluesy as they could be. I love the title \\"Honkin on Bobo\\" just not enough of it, ('bobo' the harmonica that is), to make this CD worth picking up."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Polished","review":"When I heard these guys were going to do a blues cd I was pumped. Steven Tyler still has one of the best vocal ranges in the business and Joe Perry can certainly play guitar. However, this cd followed in the footsteps of their most recent cd's, which in truth are horrible. Aerosmith has fallen into the trap of overproduction. Everything they do is too polished. Nothing seems to be done in one or two takes, nothing is gritty. This band could still put out one heck of a cd if they would shake the corporate monkey of their back and just rock n roll. This could have been a great cd. I am just hoping that they put out one more true grit rock and blues cd before they call it a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap sucks junk","review":"this is nothing like you've ever heard from aerosmithNO ROCK HERE!!!! blues only and not very good blues. they made this cd for themselfs and should have kept it. they went right back to were they were at yrs ago when they started putting out crap records like draw the line, but atleast draw the line had 1 good song(kings and queens) its offical aerosmith is done"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"this aerosmith album is just another way to generate money. It sounds contrived without real emotion. Sure, the bobo is bluesaerosmith style, buttttt it is very mechanically performed. Themajority of the songs are pure filler which would be okay as a cover in several cds. Their true blues-rock songs are still from the 1970s bar none. It tries to recreate their 70s style without the hunger which they just don't have anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aerosmith Getting Back to Their Roots?","review":"I was very disapointed with their attempt at producing a Blues album. I love their usual music for what it's worth (pop-rock), and I know that they could do Blues if they really put their heart and soul into it, but,just like Jonny Lang's new album...,they didn't. I don't think that is showing much respect for their customer's intelligence to try to push this garbage off as Blues music. It is an insult to the Blues industry. Even the little harmonica on the keychain was not of the right key."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another great band bites it...","review":"What a lazy, half-hearted, boredom-driven, self-serving pile of aerocrap. I LOVE Aerosmith and have seen them in concert no less than 9 times in different cities. They are the Gods of arena rock, having written some of the greatest rock classics of all time. But this album was just ridiculous. I'm not sure who's worse, Clapton's ME AND MR JOHNSON or HONKIN ON BOBO. Buy ANY other Aerosmith CD and be blown away. At least in Aerosmith's case, you don't have to go back to the sixties or early seventies to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GLORY DAYS ARE NOT BACK!!","review":"I don't know what the hub-bub is all about...this latest effort is sadly disappointing (yet again). As an early fan of great heavy and funky blues discs (first album up to Draw The Line....all throw-a-ways after that). I should've known better than to become prematurely excited about this waste of money. Oh well!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid rock/blues collaboration","review":"I like the fact that Aerosmith just goes for it on this one. The band does a fine job of interpreting the blues through the Aerosmith filter. Tyler sings with passion, Perry rips it up as well as any other blues guitar hero and the band provides solid rhythm. Tyler's harp playing is an eye opener for a blues fan like me. I have always felt the band had a solid foundation in the blues and I am glad they were willing to take on the thankless task (saleswise)of showing their love for the music. I'm pretty sure there are Aerosmith fans and blues fans that may gripe about this one, but I found it a nice change of pace for the band and a solid rock/blues collaboration."},{"rating":"2","title":"honking on bobo","review":"Honking on Bobo, from Aerosmith has turned out to be a relatively good Album. Aerosmith used its blues roots and pulled out yet another Chapter in the Aerosmith saga. It is a little disapointing that it is not the Aerosmith that we all have come to know and love. As, with Aerosmith the older music is what will always be the best.But non the less the album does hold power and some amazing tunes that are so easy to relate to and to understand. This album is a definet must for any Aerosmith fan and will definalty be an album to remeber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"This is the best work they have done since PermenentVacation. Most every song is worth an A or B rating.Baby, Please don't go/Stop Messin Round/Road Runner/Shame Shame Shame/Back Back Train/You got a move arethe best tracks on here. Most of the others are goodaswell. However, it's nearly impossible to find analbum with atleast 6 top notch songs. Baby Pleasedon't go is probably the real head liner of thisablum. Today's music just don't move me all thatmuch and I have a hard time seeing how old schoolfans could dislike this album. Now I like a FEWsongs from 88-2001 such as \\"Janie Got a Gun\\" \\"Jaded\\"Don't Wanna Miss a Thing\\" but make no mistake...Thisis the best they've done since 1987."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honkin' On Gold!","review":"Finally, Aerosmith have returned to good, classic rock music. I was getting sick of all the poppy, mainstream songs they were putting out Ex. Just Push Eject. Now, we can enjoy a good Aerosmith record of the likes of Rocks and Toys in the Attic. Forget everything after Nine Lives, this is the future of Aerosmith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"\\"Honkin' On Bobo\\" is simply an unreal cd...it takes Aerosmith back to its roots and keeps the songs coming in true Aerosmith form. Highlights are \\"Road Runner\\", \\"Baby, Please Dont Go\\", and \\"Jesus is on the Main Line\\"...of course, those are only three, but the whole cd is AMAZING! Their last cd, \\"Just Push Play\\", was great, but this is what I believe Aerosmith is truly all about, and they sound like they had an amazing time recording this CD. Way to go, guys. Cant wait for the next one already...this one will hold me over until then, and then some. WAY TO BE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time","review":"I have every Aerosmith album to date. I've been an Areosmith fanfor about 30 years. I have too say they are back on top of my playlist. This album is simply great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith is baaaaaaaaaack in the saddle, again!","review":"Tyler's vocals are some of his most impressive ever, Perry and Whitford trade insane licks throughout, Hamilton is right on with the base lines every step of the way, and Kramer is as powerful as ever on the drums. This is by far and away one of the best Aerosmith albums ever. The blues are finally back to American rock and roll. Every song is recorded live in studio and the musicianship of the 50 something year olds is at its peak. From the high octane \\"Baby Please Don't Go\\" to the soulful \\"Back Back Train\\" with Perry on vocals, there isn't a single song that doesn't absolutely rock. I have to stop myself from writing any more, because I'm realizing that words just can't describe how great this album is. You have to hear it and let it overtake your soul to truly understand what a masterpiece it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very bluesy rock album","review":"Every song is a hit! The first three left my jaw on the floor. The licks & riffs on the tin sandwich are jamming!!! It was a great Father's Day gift from my 15 year old daughter; To think she would be turned on by one of the same bands I listened to as a teenager says a great deal about the relevance and staying power of Aerosmith!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"Thank you Aerosmith! This has barely been out of my CD player for the last 2 weeks! As one other reviewer said, this is not a blues record. But as true music fans will know, rock and roll is got its start in the blues, and this is kick-ass rock and roll staying true to its roots. Steven Tyler sounds better vocally than he has in years, and Joe Perry is amazing as always.I went to their concert in Houston about a month ago, and it was their best that I have been to (and this was my 4th in the last 15 years). Bottom line - they're finally doing the music they love - and it shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies and germs....AeroZzzzzzzzzzz","review":"From the opening announcement of \\"Ladies and gentlemen...\\" I had a sinking feeling about this album. That intro sounds like it was the tenth or eleventh take and, thus, loses all of the spontaneity it was meant to convey. I've listened to \\"Honkin'\\" several times and I just don't love it. Being picky about album artwork, I have to mention that the Photoshop-enhanced cover of the CD looks really fake. Why couldn't they have real lipstick on that harmonica from a real woman's real lips? That might've been cool. Might've been. Anyway, there are some good songs (or good PARTS of songs) on here, but overall it fails to impress me much. I was kina hopin' for an album that sounded more like their 1973 debut (my personal favorite), but this sounds like all the other overproduced, modern releases by Aerosmith and I just don't buy that these guys are REALLY having fun anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"about the worst cd ive come across","review":"Drunk guy blues music, not even close to rock.

This is the same glossy Aerosmith that arrived with \\"Permanent Vacation\\" and no older than that. If you like that style, this album is fine. To me, it comes no where close to exploring the depths and talents of this band, it is merely more bubble gum rock, over the top and far away from that great rythm and blues band that gave us \\"Get Your Wings\\", \\"Toys in the Attic\\" and especially their first self titled album.

I have read it three times now, and each time I discover a new level of Stevens' character. Ishiguro, in his mellifluous prose, plants subtle hints at the relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton throughout. Ishiguro stubbornly assumes the style of a butler, never letting up in his tone, even at the end. All in all, a masterful piece of literature that deserved the Booker Prize. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Novel for School Studies","review":"I chose this book for a 'Review of Personal Reading' that I did for Higher English at school.

The story is confusing, the butler reminds everything so disordently, ah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie","review":"I like Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins as much as anyone, but the book is far more satisfying than the movie. For one, given the impressionist technique used to advance the narrative, learning the truth about Lord Darlington is a far more satisfying experience when reading the book than seeing the movie. It is only then that the reader is alert to the fact that everything he had been told is warped by the hero's perspective-he cannot admit to us or himself that he has given his life to an unjust cause. Rather than spoil anything else, I will leave it at that. Read the book, before seeing the movie, you will not be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book","review":"This novel is so heartbreakingly beautiful I get shivers even thinking about it. I loved it on so many levels: as a portrait of upper-class England between the wars, as a subtle tale of unrequited love, as an examination of regret at the end of one's life. It's absolutely a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll take Mr. Hudson","review":"I remain baffled by the acclaim heaped on this book. I was never convinced by Stevens, who feels like a literary construct, a cliche \\"perfect servant\\". He's so self-effacing that he barely exists as a man. I kept thinking of Mr. Hudson on \\"Upstairs, Downstairs.\\" Now there is a butler who is also a real human being with his own opinions and feelings. I'm sad to learn that high school kids are being assigned to read this pretentious bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"That Ishiguro Sadness","review":"Ishiguro, in his quiet way, undermines notions of loyalty and morality. His protagonist, an aging butler, post-WWII, in an era of aristocratic decline, experiences a moral crisis as he reviews his life and career. The book is lovely. The film is lovely. Both made me cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This book just took my breath away. It is an exquisitely written novel that touches the soul on every level. Without question, one of the great English language novels of the last 25 years. Mr. Ishiguro is a major talent. Pity he's not heard from too often. The story of Stephens, the ideal English butler who quietly watches his orderly, yet empty life collapse around him with only regrets to comfort him is a universal tale of loneliness brought beautifully and painfully to life by this very talented writer. This is a novel for those who understand what literature truly is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"This book is the most booring book I have ever read. Nothing really happens, and unless you are interested in an old butlers sick manners and strange behavior don't read it. Izhiguro can really writes pages up and down without getting anywhere. \\"What is a great butler?\\" is the main question in the book. I can't say Im interested to know about it. The love story between him and Miss Kenton is also not very exciting, if you want to read a romantic book - don't read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new side of England","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The hardest thing about the book is understanding what England was like during this time period. I would advise doing a little bit of research just to get some background information, the story will make a whole lot more sense. Also, this isn't one of those books you can read a little bit then put down and start again a few weeks later you will miss something. You may even have to read the book two times to really see the subtle passion within the main character, Mr. Stevens and the highly questionable romance between him and another servant in the Darlington house Miss. Kenton. This book has everything rolled into one-love, war, death, economy etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Remains of the Day","review":"So eloquently written that it isn't until the last chapter that the reader realizes his/her heart has been ripped out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Devoted Professional","review":"Brilliant novel about a butler so dedicated to perfection that he suppresses all human emotion in the quest for professional \\"dignity\\" and service to a great man. Feelings of love, grief, guilt & shame are banished in a life of service, and Stevens is ever searching for a way to improve, even in (what should be) casual \\"banterings\\" with a new American employer. However, traces of the butler's humanity emerge as he travels the countryside in hopes of having a former maid return to Darlington Hall. The true character of his former employer, the words of a letter from Miss Kenton, and his own past behavior are under scrutiny during his travels. I loved the subtlety & elegant melancholy of this novel. Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"No one knows Six Sigma, which seeks near perfect customer satisfaction, like George Eckes, the consultant who literally wrote the book on it (The Six Sigma Revolution: How General Electric and Others Turned Process into Profits). In his second book, Eckes emphasizes the importance of molding organizational culture to generate broad acceptance of a Six Sigma initiative, using illustrative examples from his workshops. He describes ways to overcome internal resistance to change, to sell the program's benefits and to get key people as well as the masses on board. If you are launching a Six Sigma program, Eckes provides many specific suggestions of strategies you can employ. But because much of Eckes' wisdom can be applied more generally to organizational change efforts, we [...] recommend this insightful book to any executive, whether or not Six Sigma is your strategy of choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best people-oriented book for Six Sigma practitioners","review":"Mr. Eckes has done us all a great service by applying his background as a psychologist to Six Sigma implementation, both from a tactical and strategic perspective. It's easy to get caught in the technical trap of Six Sigma and overlook the people impact. In this book, George bypasses the technical side, assuming we are familiar with it, and gets into the people issues from every perspective I can think of. There isn't another book out there that deals with this issue as clearly and in as much depth as MAKING SIX SIGMA LAST. Great Book!!! Five Stars.

People like John Graunt, Adolphe Quetelet, and Florence Nightengale, who may get brief mentions in other books, find the spotlight on them and their lives' work in this book. Because of this project, I have become familiar with the body of mathematical historical and biographical literature, and I have not come across anything that remotely shares the focus of TRIUMPH OF NUMBERS.As we move to the increasingly data-driven society outlined in Ian Ayres' SUPERCRUNCHERS.

Fabulously balanced--a real precision tool. The setting magnet and slot on the top comes in handy at times you wouldn't expect. Only drawback might be the performance of the shortish claw. It can sometimes require perpendicular pulling on a nail as small as a 10D.

It often reads like a mere set list for the recording dates; and since Matteo offers very little analysis or insight, the useful information in the book could probably be boiled down to 10 of the small pages.Of the volumes in the series I've read, this is the only one that I consider disappointing. For the quality of writing and information, the best volumes are in my opinion and this order: Erik Davis on Led Zeppelin IV, Hugo Wilcken on David Bowie Low, Mark Pollizoti on Highway 61 Revisited, Bill Janowitz on Exile on Main Street, Andy Miller on the Kinks Are the Village Preservation Society. All of those are worth reading. Go elsewhere on the Beatles Let It Be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read several of the books in this excellent series, and I've been a Beatles fan since I was a very small child, so it's a bit hard for me to give this book a one-star review, but I have to.

But too much religious/philisophical jargon intertwined between almost her every thought & opinion gets to be too much after awhile. Unfortunately the author seems to take readers for granted that only people practicing Eastern religion...especially Feng Shui are buying her books. I don't think she's considered that she spends far too much time emphasizing philisophical opinions instead of sticking to the meat & potatoes that most people bought the book for.I wouldn't buy one of her books again...as I don't want to hear all the superstition about angled ceilings being negative energy & blah, blah, blah.Too bad...a designer with her experience isn't teaching a new generation how to decorate instead of advocating her philosophies.Don't recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview","review":"Great book to get an overview of particular corvette models - and what should be on each car.

I would recommend this along with a pricing guide to help search for the perfect vette!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The plot concept in this book is interesting, but the execution falls flat. Blackthorn should have stuck to writing a political treatise if he wanted to share his ideas, instead of insulting the memory of a dead man by putting extremely unlikely words into his mouth.Blackthorn is not a very good writer. The action is stilted and sometimes confusing, the dialog isn't believable, and his metaphors are truly awful. The characters are one-dimensional, and the reader knows exactly what will happen at the end of the book from the very first page. It's cliched and almost boring.In short, if you're interested in the revolution and Cuba, read a biography of Che. If you want to hear a painful rendition of Blackthorn's political ideals (based on Plato and Thomas Jefferson's conception of the \\"republic\\") - don't bother even then. Read Plato and Jefferson and spare yourself this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identity revealed","review":"The mysterious, \\"internationally known,\\" author of this novel is none other than Gary \\"Monkey Business\\" Hart, former Senator from Colorado. His warm regard for Che Guevara is typical of the fuzzy-minded generation which always thought that \\"Dr. Castro's\\" bloody tyranny would turn out well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great premise that falls flat on its face","review":"Blackthorn has managed to take a great concept for a novel with unique potential and turn into unreadable drivel. The idea that Guevera didn't die and that Castro ultimately gives up power and all the consequences following is quite tantalizing. But it's just too far fetched to be taken seriously, especially when the narration focuses on the thoughts and musings of Guevara. Che is warped into some type of soap opera character coming out of hiding to reclaim Cuba, and the story also fails in large part because of the awful dialogue. Every time Che appears in the story and you are forced to read the dreadful dialogue you almost become angry at the author. The writer seems to have done some good research and has some great imagination, but just can't put it all together and write it. I had great expectations for this book and was more dissapointed than I had been in a long while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this book","review":"Skip over this book if you are looking for a basic book of jewelry making techiniques.

A country boy and his alcoholic talking (and annoyingly dubbed) goat move to Prague and get into trouble, until he demonstrates some woodworking skill and becomes involved with a clock maker - and some local talent. There are bullies and bartenders, Satan and soul-selling, lots of drinking and a couple half moons, but it's all in good fun. I wouldn't have a problem showing this to any kids though I suspect they'd be too spoiled by growing up around the crowd-pleasing glitz of Pixar films to enjoy it, but I definitely did. Animation is not Pixar-par to put it kindly, not even Pixar-circa-1988-par, but it works.

The pattern insert works well with my pattern collars (Porter Cable style) and I have found that to be very useful.I would observe that they are not absolutely flush with the router table. There are sink marks in the plastic and some other minor molding issues that lead to gaps of probably 5-25 thou between a straight edge and the cover.

Some of the boxed quotes were inspirational, but the format became annoying after awhile and interfered with reading the book. As the book progressed many of the author's statements were unproven claims with a clear anti-capitalist slant and a naivety of economics and history. He could (and should) have stuck to spiritual issues, but couldn't resist ranting about all the bad things big corporations do to us poor, helpless victims.

A rather long and tedious read.Note: I've read this entire series up toThe Body in the Attic: A Faith Fairchild Mystery (Faith Fairchild Mysteries), and the best rating I've given any of them is 2 stars, which is sad and says a lot about the series. I kept reading because it really has potential but it never lives up to it, so save yourself the trouble and agony and try a a different series, such as Carolyn Hart'sDeath on Demand (Death on Demand Mysteries, No. 1)series, most of which are fun and enjoyable, or stop afterThe Body in the Cast: A Faith Fairchild Mystery, which was probably the best of the series.

Colson has not achieved the wonderful sense of political purity that pervades most of Lenin's work, and his sex scenes, while vivid, are not particularly compelling. But I was grateful to hear about his menage a trois with Ann Coulter and Ted Bundy and wish him many happy returns for his \\"new life.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Invaluable","review":"This book was an invaluable asset to my growth as a Christian in the past year. Mr. Colson and Ms. Pearcey connect the thread of a Christian world-view through all major areas of our culture and rejects any effort to compartmentalize spirituality. As our culture attempts to compress Christianity into a small box that can only be opened on Sunday mornings, Christians in turn need to reach out and show that Christianity is not only true but rational and compatible with scientific theory and essential to moral preservation. This book also gives \\"normal\\" people enough information to credibly discuss difficult topics such as intelligent design.Life is only going to get more difficult for believers and this book gives exceptional support for those who are trying to understand how the culture has deteriorated and how we need to go about not only surviving but making an impact in a \\"tolerant\\" world which is stifling the name of Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Now Shall We Live","review":"Foundational to the Christian faith this book is easy to read, logical and usable.

They are DIFFERENT books. And, buyer be warned, if you try to buy the Kindle version of the Devotional version with Anne Morse, you will get the other version of the book with coauthor Nancy Pearcy. I have tried multiple times with calls and emails to Amazon customer service to make them aware of this, but they haven't responded effectively (obviously) and so the kindle link still leads to the other book. I have searched the original Publishers website and I don't think an ebook version of the Devotional version is even available. Fix this Amazon! You are usually so great with customer service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory reading for Intelligent Americans","review":"If you only read one book this year, let it be this one! Charles Colson gives you the 10,000 foot level view of our culture and traces the problems in our society, back to their philisophical origins. From Frued to Stalin to Einstien, the autheor shows how we have been shaped and corrupted by 100 years of ideas and new philosophies, that haven't even worked for the those who created the teachings.Our attitudes about Science, Sex, Liberalism etc., can all be traced to specific people who often fell pray to their own theories.This book will open your eyes and help you see more clearly the forces at work in our society and how they ultimately lead us to our own destruction. Colson also gives us a glimpse of hope for the future that starts with knowledge and a real understanding of the importance of God in our survival on this planet...it's worth a second read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presenting the Christian Worldview","review":"This book does an excellent job in serving two primary purposes. The first is in making the intellectual case for Christ. The second is presenting Biblical Christianity, not as something that involves only spiritual side, but as an entire worldview that involves every aspect of our lives. For those of us who have a difficult time making the case for Christ except in spiritual terms, this book can be a big help (beginning with such fundamentals as the case for the existence of God). And, perhaps more importantly, it helps us better understand our role as Christians in the world at large. I heartily recommend it. And a final note. As much as I admire Chuck Colson, and whereas he provided the anecdotes, I suspect that Nancy Pearcey did most of the heavy lifting in writing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, captivating, I've read it several times.","review":"A truly unusual book written 20 years ago.

The only people who have a problem with Budge, are those who believe the altered noses, lips and sand blasted colors of the remaining Egyptian statues...represent the African people who were originally the Kamitians. Budge and other white European scholars who 'told it like it was' are constantly being ridiculed for not joining the bogus scheme of alterations and forgeries in the effort of 'whitewashing Egypt' as is the trend today. Egypt is a name given to it by Alexander the Great, when he conquered the land and defeated the Persians. It was known as Kamit for thousands of years prior to the newer term of Egypt.

You should not think to use it on weird faucets but I have used it on 3 different kinds and it works fine. If you have an \\"expensive\\" weird looking faucet, then it might not work. The reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a tad long. With shallow sinks, it might be troublesome to have a hose attached without bending the hose a lot.

Directions were non-existant and, while some claim it is intuitive, it's not really. Once I got some further instruction I figured out that ut will not work on the vast majority of sink faucets. The faucet must be narrow enough (max about 1 inch) to fit into the adapter. So fancy wider faucet casings won't work. And the bend in the faucet must be less than about an inch max (bend to spout). There must be a bend in the faucet of 90 degrees or less. Claims to fit most...I would guess it would fit very few."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's my directions since it only comes with a picture.","review":"Just got this connector so can't give it 5 stars yet but so far so good. Before ordering I read the reviews and decided to get it and figure it out myself. Start out pulling apart the 2 pieces by pulling down on the orange band (quick release). Now you have one part to screw your hose to and the other will be on your faucet. Your faucet will ultimately be pressed into the white rubber seal. Adjust the connector by turning the black flang so your faucet head with fit into the opening. Press down the orange top so the faucet presses into the white seal tightly. Turn on water...no leaks?

The Claber connector solves this problem because it does not require the tip to be in the exact size or male/female. However, it may still not work with all faucets. First, the faucet should be about 1 inch in width; otherwise, it won't fit. Height is adjustable so it should not be a problem for most faucets. If the end of the faucet where you want to place this connector is rounded, it may not install well or it will leak.

The styles range a bit widely, but because the group is so tight and cohesive it holds together. My only reservation is the track \\"For Miles,\\" which to me doesn't hold up and is way overlong. OK, I understand that others will disagree, and that Jarrett wanted to make a strong personal statement about his old friend Miles, but the track rambles and does not have any unifiying theme or melodic sense. For my taste, it drags, and at 18 minutes is quite skippable. No worries, though.

Anyone who enjoys his work with the Mavericks or his more recent solo albums will like this cd. It does have a different feel, more stripped down and basic. Raul does a great job with the vocals and you really hear the music behind him. Sometimes music seems to be all about the singer but on this album the instruments shine along with the vocals. It is very laid back - not one to put on while cleaning the house but, a good one for a mellow mood. Blue Bayou is amazing and one of my all time favorite songs Sentimental Reasons will have you singing to your sweetie and waltzing around the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mix","review":"What a great mix of songs.

Rick has re-entered Mackenzie Cates' life and their passion has been reborn, but since neither is into menage a' trois, they need to get rid of the two thousand year old ghost living inside him, reunite said ghost and his doomed love in the far flung past, and save the world.With more of a backstory explaining the how this time travel scenario functions, the main plot probably would have worked better. Being thrown into the middle of what felt like an established scenario felt a bit off, detracting from an otherwise intriguingly complex situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"I'm a big fan of anything having to do with time travel -- have just always been facinated by it -- and I typically enjoy how it can be incorporated into stories.

It has absolutely nothing to do with the Gnostic gospel attibuted to Mary Magdalene. Rather it takes a very fundametalist view of the role of Mary Magdalene in the Gospels of Matther, Luke and John. Batchelor uses Mary as a means to cover a number of subjects that are only loosely related to Mary's role in the Gospel stories.I would definitely NOT recommend this book if you are looking for something to challenge you both spiritually and intellectually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent devotional book with vedantic concepts- must read","review":"This book puts forth the epitome of what a sincere spiritual aspirant should aspire to reach in devotion with practical, vedantic explanations.When I was given this book I thought it would be just another fictional-missionary-style book that almost every religion is flooding the bookstalls with; but when I started to read, the wonderful storeytelling of the deepest of pure devotion caught my attention so that I had to complete reading this book as soon as possible. I ended up recommending this book to my like minded friends.The author boldly puts forth the concepts of responsibility for ones own action, the total surrender, absolute faith, ultimate loyalty, use of intellect for discrimination etc. that are so very necessary for spiritual progress.This book is for sincere, serious spiritual aspirants. The various concepts are very good meditation subjects. This book is to be read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't measure up","review":"I have performed extensive research on Mary Magdalene.

It's not classifiable as country, as where her first 2 albums. This album has a jazz flavor in much of it, particularly soft jazz. As a whole, the album is much softer, gentler, and acoustic than her previous work. There is quite a bit of piano. The songs are slower and more reflective, kind of like a lingering thought process discussed in the lyrics and reflected by the tempo. However, Ruby Jewel is a sassy song and Going Down is very spirited. Dying Breed is a moving discussion of a family with a history of short lifespans due to substance abuse. I don't like this album as much as Alison's first 2, but don't worry, it's still worthy. Further, it grows on the listener. So if you buy it, give it a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong title-Should be Misfortune","review":"I am really glad that I listened to Show before I listened to this as it has a lot of songs from Miss Fortune, but much better versions.I'll explain the 2 stars,1 is for Allison's great voice,though not loud enough in the mix, the other is for Allison's material,lots of good songs here.This is the strangest and worst production of any record I've ever heard and I've heard a lot as I do country reviews. I love Allison Moorer,I made \\"Show\\" my pic for best Country CD of the year.All I can say about the production is weird.The Nashville string machine is used way too much and lots of strange horns,any guitar except for a couple of very nice sparsely produced songs is buried in the mix.That's All folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lyrically challenged","review":"To me, This is one sorry album.

This is a distinct departure, from the alt-country sound of the first two records to a more \\"Nashville\\" sound on this one. And we're talking a Nashville sound that's reminiscent of country/pop from 35 years ago-- one of the songs sounds like something Bobbie Gentry might have done.She should shake hands with the producers of this record and run like blazes away from them. The songs are overproduced, some vastly so-- it was like they couldn't leave a good song, or her performance, alone without seeing what instruments and background vocals they could layer on. They made lab rats out of some of this music. If a song really needed that kind of help it shouldn't have been on the album.Still, I bought it, and if you are an Allison Moorer fan you will want to buy this CD, because she's a gem even in an effort like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss Fortune","review":"HiIam really a fan of Allison moorer,However i was really dispointed with this cd.

The largest defect is that if you make an error in entering data, say trying to add 3 feet to 5 meters, the calculator properly tells you that you have made an error, but then it essentially locks up. You can't get back to where you were in the calculation before the error. It has a memory register, but you can't just put a number there, you can only add to the number previously there. Also, the buttons and legends are too small and the feel of the buttons is not very good. (Sometimes the button doesn't make contact when you think it did, and you get thrown into errorland on the next key stroke.)(Sonin didn't reply to my email inquiry about the error problem.)

If you knew Mr. Tim, this book won't seem like much more than a mean prank on someone no longer around to defend himself.As a friend and a fan, defending him is the very least I can do.Therefore, in my honest opinion, this book is a total waste of your time, your money, and the paper it is printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad, it's tragic.","review":"Plodding, slow-moving and obviously a fabrication to anyone who knew anything about Tiny Tim.

So there are a few great songs on this album too, but to be honest this album is far from the other one in quality. Many songs are just too annoying, too much vocals that kills the song and too much \\"rock\\" into the music, some songs even remind me of Metal-rock.

The authors concentrate only on the facts and occurrences which really matter; the book was rarely boring. And it still manages to supply a sufficient amount of information. The only negative I perceived was that with the way the book is organized, with each chapter focusing on a different person, rather than period, was that it was disjointed, and virtually impossible to follow the big picture, the \\"story\\", if you will.

The art appears plopped into the flow of the text almost randomly, and the copy quality of the art is poor: grainy and difficult to decipher the subject(s), even in the larger pictures.

No accountability for this lying seller who sells fake Ray Bans just refund my money.

It is made of materials found on more expensive knives, is sharp, cuts smoothly, and has a nice stable grip. The blade is angled on one side only, but that seems to add to its ability to cut very thin slices. I would not use this knife for cutting a block of cheese into uniform slices. It is like any other knife -- the uniformity of slices will depend on your ability. This is more of knife to set out when you serve a chunk of manchego or gouda or brie for a get together. There will be no awkward cutting and fingering of cheeses sticking to the knife. It has already become a staple in our household!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuts well but slanted","review":"Okay, I read the review that said that the knife cuts in a slant due to it having an extra bevel on one side but not the other, and thought that surely it couldn't be that bad. It is that bad! You have been warned! While cutting, you have to continuously torque the knife to twist it in the opposite direction of the bevel or it will end up cutting an extra .5 inch at the bottom of the slice when compared to the top. This gets to be uncomfortable in my wrist. However, the knife does cut through the cheese easier than other full bladed knives. If I had to do it over again, I would purchase a different knife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed design for cheese","review":"This knife has a serrated edge with an asymmetrical bevel.

Baumeister conveys his theoritical perspective on the meaning of the self (and its implications on the meanings of life)in a highly accessible and convincing manner. He argues from the perspective that the self is a social construct and that in the West, the meanings that have been put into the construction and maintenance of this self have created a burden on the individual. The stress associated with maintaining this concept of self can be used to explain why people engage in behaviors such as alcholism and sado-masochism.

Kelly has the perfect pace, variety and repetition in her workouts to give you a complete total body training with weights and cardio. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good total body workout","review":"This is a good total body workout that makes a good use of one's time. Because it is both aerobic and toning work, it is very efficient. There are good number of repetitions for the toning exercises and kelly does a good job of motivating you without sounding like a drill sergeant. You keep your heart-rate up with the aerobics. The step is used very little, you can do the workout without a step if necessary. For the core work at the end you can lie on the floor instead of on the step. And for the aerobic part you can put a towel on the floor as a mark to replace the step. I like to use the step, but in the past when i was recovering from an injury i avoided using it. The level is more intermediate than advance.the cooldown/stretch at the end is not enough (thus the 4 stars) but personally i do not mind adding a couple of minutes to do some stretching on my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.I have quite a few workouts with this instructor. Generally, I like her slightly serious, quiet style of instructing and find I like her weight routines better than her strictly cardio workouts.Pros: Nice mix of weights and cardio. Music has a beat to follow so ok. Moves on step are simple and effective which is great --- I do not care for overly complex choreography. \\"Backup dancers\\" are non-annoying. Overall, a good workout.Cons: Camera work was a bit off with the unnecessary zooms and --- perhaps because there are really too many people, 3 max is perfect --- some of the people are sort of cut off from the frame. Cuing, as usual, rather weak but, as always with DVD, this will probably not matter over time as you repeat the workout and the moves are simple enough that you can catch up easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pristine sound, rich synthesizer sonic textures","review":"The beautiful sonic result found in this CD is a combination of rich synthesizer sounds and inspiration. The synthesizer nowadays is a so widely used instrument that it's easy to forget how expressive it can be. The listener can trip into the sound textures of Zero One. It has subtle electonic percussion and processed vocals blended with synthesizer sounds that are in continuous motion, which results in a unique character."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kind of music","review":"I always get a smile on my face when these songs come up on my iPod.

I bought them 8 months ago, we have used them continuously since, and there isn't a chip, crack or stain - quite a surprise, seeing how clumsy we can be! They are large, so hold a really good amount of tea, coffee, whatever. Definitely worth the price.Update (Oct 2011): we have now had these mugs for 5 years - a record for us! Of the two that we use regularly every day, one has a slight surface crack on the inside but other than that they are still in excellent shape. The other two mugs in the set are sitting at the back of the cupboard, patiently waiting for the day that they will be needed as replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book :)","review":"I was just looking for it today (unsuccessfully), even though I'm thirteen.

Bad writing, bad effects, bad acting, just bad. If you are a particular fan of one of the cast, though, you might still find it amusing. I love John Piper-Ferguson, and very much enjoyed his over-the-top villain, although he couldn't pick an accent to save his life.

Something different than...well, different than this. I don't know what I waz expecting, but after hearing the double CD Sleeping with Ghosts and the incredibly intricate remixes of the second CD of remixes, MEDS feels like, just the same old thing. Been there, done that. I was hoping for so much more. I can't say this was a horrible album, it wasn't. It just wasn't new enough and exciting enough for me to give a better rating. Very lackluster contribution to an otherwise phenomenal discography of a great band, who wasn't unable to live up to its greatness this time. Hopefully next time. I'm keeping my fingers crossed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on","review":"Placebo have always troden a fine line between exceptional and trashy, but however have always managed to stay on the side of exceptional.The latest offering is in my opinion there best release to date.

Placebo committed the gravest sin: bore me. Is there a worse way to spend time?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Distinctive Band","review":"Placebo is a very distinctive band becuase the lead singer's voice is very unique. Not like anyone else right now in Rock. The best songs on the cd are Meds, Infra-Red, Follow The Cops Back Home, and Post Blue. At first I wasn't impressed to much with the cd, but Placebo is the type of band that you have to listen too more then once to appreciate them. Placebo is definitely a good band and I definitely recommend the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this album","review":"it's actually painfull to see how placebo repeats everything they did in the past, but in a very enoying, uninspired way. If you have the first album, without you i'm nothing and black market music- you have more then enough. From there on placebo has nothing to say... I guess that's the tragedy of pop music....The production is awfull, Brian Molko doesn't sound pure at all and the lyrics are so pretentious you really want to go back to the store and get you money back.. bad deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Pay, They Control","review":"Don't buy this CD. The music is fine, but if you are anything more than a sheep you will not allow a record company and/or artist to decide for you what you can do with music that you purchased. I bought this CD and was disgusted by the digital limitations. I am not a criminal/pirate, yet I'm treated like one. I will never spend another penny on this band or a Virgin Records release."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"Placebo has spent so much time polishing their sound, they've worn away the roots of what made them a great band. I was a fan since the day I picked up their first album in 1996. And Without you I'm Nothing blew me away after that. But when Black Maket music came out, I could sense things were changing. And while sleeping with Ghosts had it's moments,some very good, I found myself trying to convince myself to like it more than I actually did. I liked the more organic feel of the first two albums. For me, it's over for this band. So sad to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very impressive","review":"this album really is nothing to be that impressed about. the best songs for sure are post blue and pierrot the clown and are really the only two that sound like \\"placebo\\" to me. a song to say goodbye and infra-red seem good at first but get old really fast and are pretty mediocre songs. meds and the rest of the songs are pretty boring and sadly predictable. i've got to say that placebo's self-titled has got to be my favorite. it is the most angst-filled and grungy and had nothing to prove. the rest of their albums are all really good though and are all different. i think the most dissappointing thing about meds is that instead of actually playing something original and different, it seems like they're just trying too hard to sound different and just end up sounding somewhat the same, somewhat predictable, and ultimately somewhat not their \\"trueselves\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"I couldn't wait for the cd to be released in the states, so I ordered it from Amazon UK. I was blown away. There is usually a point that a band reaches where their music begins to get dull and boring. Placebo is nowhere near this point. The music on this album is absolutely beautiful, and I can't seem to get enough of it. It is leaning more towards an electronic sound, so it's not like their debut cd, but more like Sleeping with Ghosts. It's awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound evolves. So does Placebo","review":"You might notice a few lackluster reviews, claiming this album is not as good as earlier work. Why oh why would you ever want Placebo to stick to only one sound, even if it were the sound that created the brilliant Without You I'm Nothing? I would hate anything adhered to too much, certainly over the span of 5 studio albums.MEDS, for me, is fresh and a rewarding listen. Where Sleeping With Ghosts might have approached too polished, MEDS goes to a slightly less overwrought construction, with a little less synth. My personal favorites are \\"Infra Red\\", \\"Blind\\", and \\"One of a Kind\\" ...you might notice there's some more generally bouncier songs on this album, but it's not without weak spots, for me, \\"because i want you\\" and \\"cold light of morning\\" just arent my personal highlights from the album.They took the natural next step in the evolution of their sound with MEDS. Give it a few listens before you decide what you ultimately think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meds is an appropriate name","review":"Meds as an album, is not a grand achievement in Placebo's musical capabilities. Some tracks do have a nice pop cleanliness to them that is very catchy, while others seem to lack inspiration. Molko said he was on meds, and i truly believe this album is better if either: you are on any drugs, or you actually have a respect for going back to the old, trying the new, etc. The production value that Sleeping With Ghosts had was tampered down and more repetative on this album, not to mention the lyrics. I am sad to say that this album was actually a disappointment. Sorry Brian, Stefan, Steve, don't let the producer take over your work after its done."},{"rating":"2","title":"meds","review":"You don't need meds to like this album, although not as strong as the previous releases I still think this is a great album , especially a song to say goodbye is one of their best tracks ever. Again my thumbs up for this great band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the cowbell?","review":"I have been a huge fan of Placebo for a long time- ever since I saw them on MTV2 ten years ago, my jaw hit the floor and it was \\"pure morning\\" from then on. Their albums have always been there when I needed them the most, and for that I thank them. However, this album lacked what had drawn me to them again and again- their rhythm section. The earth rumbling baselines; the foundational drumming. Placebo is better then the sum of their parts, and, when this album only concentrated on one part we were left with a deflated ablum. The singing was what it had to be- overall, I felt it was strong. Yet, that is all we were left with, was the singing backed up by some digital keyboarding that would only get a C+ in my grade book. I am a huge fan of minimalism- hell, I even have an Eames chair- I just don't think it works for Placebo just yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"..Mur","review":"Being a Sneaker Pimps fan and having heard a few of Placebo's songs before (and bought one of their two-disc collection), I had higher expectations for this album.I simply wanted the \\"Running Up That Hill\\" remake, the last song. I saw how many songs there were in the whole album and that is was only seven dollars as well while just buying the one song would cost me a whole buck anyway. I thought it was an absolute bargain.So I bought the whole lot.I feel like I took six dollars and gave it to a bum who in turn walked away peeling off his grungy begging outfit with my money in his pocket.Duped. Listen to a sample of the songs before you buy. Don't impulse buy Placebo. Their music is for very.. particular tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew it!","review":"When I first heard about this, I knew they would turn it into a movie. And why not? This is a near tour de force espionage film, that is a splendid, though scary, watch. I read a review that said that they focused too much on one \\"not so important figure.\\" What? How else were they going to get inside the personal side of him, if it wasn't from the person closest to him? How else could you tell a fully accurate version of this story? Idiots!Yes, I recommend this film for: 1) The intrigue of the story line; 2) The acting.Aside from Ryan Phillipes shody performance in the first half, Chris Cooper makes one of th emost splendid performances I've seen in years.Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spy CIA/FBI Thriller","review":"Highly recommend this dvd.

Guess which movie stunk like 3 day old chinese food? Without stating the obvious, I was genuinley impressed with \\"Breach\\". I didn't hear much hype over it so I wasn't expecting much. I loved all of the performaces, I think Chris Cooper and Laura Linney should at least be nominated for some kind of award, although I don't know if their performances will be outshadowed by other trendy actors or remebered during award season. This is one of the best movies I've seen this year and hopefully it will be recognized for it's merits."},{"rating":"1","title":"BREACH","review":"The film showed very dark - as though it were all filmed at night with poor lighting.

Both Chris Cooper and Laura Linney's - both of whom I adore - performances were so completely over the top that I found them unbelievable in their respective roles.Asking Ryan Phillippe to smooth it out is close to ludicrous. I'm disappointed that I couldn't get past these head-scratching performances to enjoy the story which may have been interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tremendous Story Virtually Swept Under The Rug","review":"Chris Cooper is a remarkable genius... and enjoy anything espionage related... which is why I checked this flick out. ALOT was left out out the film, and ALOT of people SCREWED UP, in many ways being responsible for lives lost as well... though few if any would actually step forward- cowards they are... but that's how it is.

It seemed more focused on an fbi employee who was really more of a bit player in the investigation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Spy Movie!","review":"Chris Cooper!! Ryan Phillipe! Laura Linney :-) Best spy vs. FBI movie ever. I like it! If you like suspenseful, smart movies with excellent actors, good amount of creepy badness, conflicted young FBI agents, well, you cannot go wrong with this one! Try it, you'll like it. I particularly enjoyed watching Chris Cooper tear up the screen.I know, lots of cliches, but they are true in this case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncommonly good","review":"Breach is a fine film based on the true story of the uncovering of FBI operative Robert Hanssen, the most destructive counterspy in U.S. history. With tight directing, excellent music, and mostly Chris Cooper as Hanssen, this film is uncommonly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE SERIOUS","review":"I'm suposed to believe that one of the previous reviewers was actually a CIA spook? Yeah right, how about buying this nice bridge I just happen to have for sale. The fact the the movie was based on reality does not change the simple truth this movie sucks. It's not just boring, but it flat out sucked. even after watching it for an hour I didn't care who did what to whom. I just wished it would end and put me out of my misery. My advice, don't waste the time it takes to watch the credits, and if a friend suggests renting this movie, shoot them and put them out of your misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry","review":"If it dosnt have Airplane crashes or hellicopters bustin, or street gangs getting shot up or monsters chewing the crap out of someone, i dont like it!!! sorry i am an action thriller. i hated this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the button to download?!","review":"I wasted a good half hour of my life trying to figure out how to download this movie.

Acting and production values are excellent as well. The scenes between O'Neill and his wife were, for me, the weakest element; it just didn't ring true to me that he could keep her at such a distance throughout his difficult assignment. The final scene also struck me as a bit too melodramatic. But the rest of the film had me going for sure -- I'd give it four and a half stars for its genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent actors, boring plot","review":"A kind of movie no one needs.Two and a half [ Phillippe ] good actors without any chance to pusha boring, non suspending plot.Allegedly after a true story, but Chris Cooper as a pious catholic and relentless killer seems absolutely incredible.Wasted time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breach smeach","review":"I was heavily disappointed after and throughout this movie. While I must say that Chris Cooper did an excellent job, I'm not so sure about his counterpart Ryan Phillippe. At times I couldn't tell if it was poor acting, or if it was done on purpose to exaggerate the fact that he was lying. I'm leaning toward this first. This movie seriously lacked action. Aside from a few somewhat tense moments when you think Cooper might be on to Phillippe, the most action occurred when Cooper fired his gun into the air. Very predictable, they didn't even throw in any twists or anything interesting. I could have written this movie between simulations at work. Not to mention the score sounded like a ripoff of Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm Saga","review":"It was very cold in the theater, there were no scenes that made you laugh, there were no scenes that made you sigh out of anticipation the film tried it's best to grip you but there were a lot of words spoken which led to a rather inconsequential saga. Chris Cooper looked healthy, he acted ok but it was not really the sort of movie you'd watch without falling asleep. After reading the reviews, I thought I was in for a treat, it was just a lathered up brute of a boring film. I might sound like a woman in labour but honestly, this film was an absolute tanker owing to the lacklusture storyline. Not worth watching let alone purchasing. Chris Cooper is boss and Ryan Phillip is assistant to the boss. There is some sort of conspiracy against CC and frankly, I held my interest for a majority of the film but eventually it won and I lost. The Breach was disappointing, I wish I'd never watched it. That's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"well done","review":"Despite the well known facts of this case, the actors and director make it worth your time. Cooper brings out the freak in the bad guy.
